Jimmy John's owner spent $350k to 'trophy hunt' extremely endangered female Black Rhino,"Jimmy John's owner spent $350k to 'trophy hunt' extremely endangered female Black Rhino 
Tuesday, November 01, 2016 by: Ethan A. Huff, staff writer Tags: Jimmy Johns , endangered species , trophy hunting (NaturalNews) The owner of the American fast food chain Jimmy John's is under fire after photos emerged of him smiling and giving a ""thumbs up"" beside numerous endangered species that he's hunted and killed throughout Africa over the years, for seemingly no other purpose than simply to invoke death for pleasure.Reports indicate that Jimmy John Liautaud has been spending hundreds of thousands of dollars per hunting trip to gain access to these precious species, including one particular ""trophy"" hunt in which he spent a whopping $350,000 just to kill an extremely endangered female Black Rhino. Graphic photos of Liautaud with this rhino and other animals are available here , but be warned: these images are horrifyingly upsetting.Liautaud's trophy hunts are apparently a routine pastime of his, just as they are for the many other bored millionaires out there with too much time and money on their hands who seem to get a kick out of taking out the rarest animals on our planet – beautiful creatures like leopards, rhinos, lions, and even elephants, which have the largest brains of any land animals. It's the type of thing that, if more people knew about it, they'd likely stop eating at Jimmy John's altogether.Mr. Jimmy John's poaching fetish has been making the media rounds, and many are now calling on a national boycott of the sandwich chain, which has already been exposed for underpaying its employees and treating them like slave workers. The Wall Street Journal (WSJ) reported that social media users had attempted to launch a boycott of Jimmy John's using the ""#boycottjimmyjohns"" hashtag on Twitter, though the company didn't seem all that phased.Still, the issue hasn't gone away, and many in the public remain outraged over what they say is reckless and reprehensible behavior. Not only is Liautaud killing these rare and exotic animals in cold blood, but he's doing so in such an utterly cruel way that even the most avid hunters would be hard-pressed not to cringe or perhaps shed a few tears.""[U]sually the animals are lured from a national park on to private property,"" Lara Starr, investigative writer and co-founder of The Earth Child writes, noting that this is not the method Liautaud uses to kill his prey. ""Trophy hunters will leave out bait, play the sounds of other animals to lure them in, or a few other tactics to find their animal victims.""""Canned hunting is even worse,"" she adds. ""It is the 'shooting fish in a barrel' version of trophy hunting . The animals are often hand raised so they are tame and don't run away. They leave food out for them one day, then some coward creeps up and shoots them with a high powered bow or rifle. Sometimes they don't even have to creep. Sometimes they just shoot them from the back of a truck, then go back to drinking their gin & tonic like it was just a bit of harmless fun."" Trophy hunting costs do NOT help repopulate endangered animal species One of the excuses often used as justification for expensive trophy hunting escapades is that all that cash ends up getting donated to conservation programs that help repopulate the prairies, plains, and jungles with endangered species. But this isn't actually true, as only about two percent of the proceeds from these hunts ends up being used for conservation purposes.Non-trophy hunting tourism, on the other hand, is responsible for the bulk of conservation donations -- up to 15 times than what trophy hunting contributes -- according to Heather Callaghan, editor of Natural Blaze . Likewise, the claim that animals killed on trophy hunts are used to provide food for locals is also bunk, as most of the carcasses end up getting left behind for scavengers. Sources:",1
"Dakota Access Pipeline violence grows as militarized police use extreme force, tear gas on praying protesters","Dakota Access Pipeline violence grows as militarized police use extreme force, tear gas on praying protesters 
Tuesday, November 01, 2016 by: J. D. Heyes Tags: Dakota Access Pipeline , protestors , police violence (NaturalNews) Tensions are ratcheting up in a region of North Dakota where construction of a pipeline that will take oil to a refinery facility in Illinois is being built, as protestors objecting to the project are clashing with increasingly militarized police . The Bismark Tribune reported that police and protestors clashed as authorities moved in to break up a camp on private property belonging to the pipeline developers.Protestors had initially formed a line of no surrender, the paper said, but it became a line of retreat in the face of a militarized police presence that overwhelmed hundreds of Dakota Access Pipeline protestors, pushing them back from the front line of resistance to their main camp.For about five hours on Thursday, beginning around noon, police officers pressed the protesters back about a half-mile on N.D. Highway 1806, which was away from a new camp they had built earlier in the week that sat directly atop the pipeline easement. Rubber bullets, bean bags, smoke grenades and tasers Unrest continued into the evening hours, however, as police said that two fires were started on a nearby bridge, and protestors began lobbing Molotov cocktails at officers. In addition, police reported two incidents where shots were fired.The Tribune reported that one woman allegedly fired a handgun in the direction of police as she was being arrested, while an armed man who was reportedly run off the road by protesters, and was perhaps not connected to the protest, had to be treated for a gunshot wound to the hand.As police moved in, some protestors were urging calm and prayer, but others threw rocks and water bottles at approaching officers. Eventually the crowd retreated under a barrage of pepper spray, rubber and bean bag bullets, smoke grenades and tasers.By late afternoon, flames and thick plumes of smoke belched out of the cab of one of three Dakota Access Pipeline earth movers, while protestors walked back to their main camp on U.S. Army Corps of Engineers' land.In all, police arrested 141 people, the local sheriffs' department said, charging suspects with engaging in a riot, maintaining a public nuisance, and conspiracy to endanger by fire and explosion.A day before the violence, as reported by AMI Newswire , opponents of the pipeline barricaded a highway and pitched their camp on private land. These actions were led by members of the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe.The previous weekend some 127 people had been arrested.Standing Rock Chairman Dave Archambault II issued a statement last week in which he blamed the rising militarization of police for the increased tensions.""The militarization of local law enforcement and enlistment of multiple law enforcement agencies from neighboring states is needlessly escalating violence and unlawful arrests against peaceful protesters at Standing Rock,"" Archambault said, as quoted by AMI Newswire . ""We do not condone reports of illegal actions, but believe the majority of peaceful protesters are reacting to strong-arm tactics and abuses by law enforcement."" Destruction of burial grounds, water are chief concerns Law enforcement officers countered by saying that, for the vast majority of the protest thus far, they have shown remarkable patience and restraint, and that they only moved after protestors became more aggressive.Morton County Sheriff Kyle Kirchmeier ticked off a list of alleged violations by protestors, including buzzing a police helicopter with a drone and firing arrows in the direction of officers. He also said that journalists had been harassed and security personnel assaulted.""For months protesters have described us as an aggressive police force,"" Kirchmeier said in a prepared statement, AMI Newswire reported. ""We have done nothing but demonstrate patience and restraint.""Protestors are angry about the pipeline stretching across ancient burial grounds, NewsTarget reported , as well as the potential for pipeline leaks that would pollute local water sources .

Health experts share the top home remedies for fighting a cold,"Health experts share the top home remedies for fighting a cold 
Tuesday, November 01, 2016 by: Amy Goodrich Tags: cold symptoms , natural remedies , immune booster (NaturalNews) Stay well during the colder months with these simple, time-tested home remedies to prevent a common cold, help shorten the duration and get you feeling better in no time. A common cold is caused by a virus, so there is no point in taking antibiotics which only kill bacteria. While there is a host of over-the-counter remedies available to soothe the symptoms of a common cold, nature offers far better and safer solutions.We all know the prevention drill. Load up on immune boosting foods rich in vitamin C , exercise regularly and wash your hands often. But what else is there you can do to avoid a runny nose, sore throat or a cough? Seven Health editors reveal their sickness-preventing secrets. Gargle salt water If you feel the first signs of a scratchy throat, Jeannie Kim, executive deputy editor, recommends a salt-water gargle. She is convinced that it has stopped countless of her colds. To soothe a sore throat and kill the sick-making germs, combine half a teaspoon salt with one cup of water and gargle. Repeat several times a day until scratchiness disappears. Create some heat According to Clare McHugh, editor-in-chief, a hot bath or shower is the thing you need. She explains that viruses that cause a common cold don't like the heat and are discouraged to multiply if you keep your body warm. And why not add immune boosting and cold fighting essential oils to your bathtub to enhance the healing effect?Furthermore, you could try the good old hot water bottle to help loosen phlegm and deep congestions in the chest. Swallow raw garlic If you don't mind to sweat it out and have a garlic breath, Lisa Lombardi, executive editor, recommends eating or swallowing raw garlic. While the next day her symptoms usually get worse, she feels better in 3 days.If you cannot stomach garlic's taste and spiciness, then you might want to go with the traditional garlic cure which consists of garlic, lemon, and honey. Crush one clove of garlic and add it to a cup of warm water with one teaspoon of honey and the juice of one lemon. Give it a good stir and repeat this remedy two to three times a day for the duration of your symptoms. Take Echinacea Michael Gollust, the research editor, swears by echinacea lozenges. He says that while they don't stop a cold in its tracks, they definitely reduce the severity of the symptoms. The BBC, however, reports on a comprehensive review that scanned the literature and included only the very best studies, showing that people who use echinacea may also have 10 to 20 percent less chance to catch a common cold. Stay hydrated Most Health experts agree that hydration is essential for a speedy recovery. Anthea Levi, the editorial assistant, adds that if you are struggling with blocked sinuses, adding lemon juice and cayenne pepper to your glass of water is all you need to breathe freely again. Go to bed early They often say sleep is one the best natural doctors. Tomoko Takeda Canel, the acting beauty director, couldn't agree more. When she gets sick, she cancels all her plans, has a light meal and then prioritizes an early bedtime to get better.Next time you get a cold, keep these tips and tricks in mind, and you won't need over-the-counter drugs that can do more harm than good.

FDA to withdraw 2 generic ADHD drugs after determining they have no therapeutic effects,"FDA to withdraw 2 generic ADHD drugs after determining they have no therapeutic effects 
Tuesday, November 01, 2016 by: Vicki Batts Tags: FDA , ADHD drugs , market withdrawal (NaturalNews) ADHD medications have been subject to public scrutiny for quite some time. Two years ago, the FDA said it had discovered problems with a generic version of a popular ADHD drug known as Concerta. The generic, produced by the pharmaceutical company Mallinckrodt, just wasn't up to snuff. And now, the FDA seems to finally be making moves to pull this inferior product off the shelves.Generic drugs are approved by the FDA through their abbreviated new drug application (ANDA) process. In the ANDA process, the federal agency is primarily focused on data that shows the generic drug is a bioequivalent for the reference listed drug, or what many people refer to as the ""brand name"" drug.The term ""bioequivalent"" means that there is no substantial differences in bioavailability between a generic drug and the brand name product. Specifically, it suggests that the extent and rate of absorption of two drug equivalents over the same period of time, at the same dose and under the same conditions, should exhibit similar results. As the FDA explains on their website, ""The generic version must deliver the same amount of active ingredients into a patient's bloodstream in the same amount of time as the pioneer drug.""Unsurprisingly, discrepancies in actual equivalence are often discovered after a generic has been approved.Mallinckrodt's Concerta generic is not the only brand name knock-off under fire. Kremers Urban Pharmaceuticals, a subsidiary of the Lannett Company, also manufactures a generic form of the medication that the FDA's Center for Drug Evaluation and Research (CDER) has deemed insufficient.As reported by the Regulatory Affairs Professionals Society: CDER tracked the issues from December 2013 through June 2014, ran a re-analysis of bioequivalence data and ""determined that the Mallinckrodt product may deliver methylphenidate into the body at a slower rate than Concerta during the time period of 7 to 12 hours post-dosing."" Following the CDER's findings, Mallinckrodt filed a lawsuit, which was thrown out by a Maryland federal judge. The pharmaceutical company has since declined to voluntarily withdraw their product from the marketplace. And according to the FDA, the drug manufacturer has yet to submit any new data or information that confirms the bioequivalence of their product to Concerta.Similarly, the CDER concluded in June of 2014 that the data on the Kremers product is insufficient to determine whether or not their generic product is therapeutically equivalent to Concerta. In November that year, the FDA announced that their product was not sufficiently equivalent to the name brand.Both manufacturers may submit a request for a hearing to the FDA within the next month so they can attempt to show why approval for their drugs shouldn't be withdrawn.Of course, the FDA's concerns about the apparent lack of efficacy seen in these generic drugs is rather ironic, given the magnitude of other concerns surrounding these drugs. In 2006, a CBS News report revealed that 25 people died and 54 more suffered serious cardiovascular problems following the use of ADHD medication, in a period of just four years.That may not seem like a lot, but is important to recall that the FDA Adverse Event Reporting System (FAERS), which is used to track such events, is a voluntary system. Only drug manufacturers are required to report adverse events – if they know about them. Doctors, patients and family members are under no such obligation. PSQH reports that drug safety experts estimate that only about 10 percent of all adverse events will even be reported – who is to say how many people have been harmed by ADHD medications (and other drugs) and don't know it or haven't reported it?The FAERS website itself states that because of its own limitations, ""FAERS data cannot be used to calculate the incidence of an adverse event or medication error in the U.S. population."" And yet, in spite of this very statement, the FDA itself used this information to form a safety report?Over the years, several ADHD medications, like Adderall XR, have been linked to sudden death , cardiovascular problems and psychosis. According to Consumer Reports , the long-term safety of these drugs has not been evaluated or studied sufficiently, and there is evidence to suggest that the benefit of such drugs wears off after about two years. Many kids take ADHD medication for quite a bit longer than that.In spite of all of this, the FDA has yet to pull these drugs from the shelves, and is instead concerned with drugs that aren't strong enough. Medications that don't work obviously don't belong in the marketplace. However, drugs that are killing children don't belong there either. Sources:",1
How To Remove Uric Acid Crystallization in Joints,"How To Remove Uric Acid Crystallization in Joints http://blogs.naturalnews.com/remove-uric-acid-crystallization-joints/

Joint pain prevents us from exercising or doing simple tasks like walking. Unfortunately, it only gets worse as we age. This happens because the fluid (synovial fluid) in the joints reduces as we age. Reduction of this fluid increases friction on the joints and leads to arthritis. 
But research also shows that uric acid can cause arthritis. Build-up of uric acid in the joints can damage joint tissues and cause pain. The build-up happens when the kidneys don’t excrete enough uric acid. It can also be triggered by the body converting purines to uric acid fast. Long-term build-up of uric acid can cause inflammation and reduce your mobility. 
Switch to an Alkaline Diet 
There’s been a never-ending argument about whether alkaline diets reduce acidity in the body or not. In fact, some experts have discredited them as useless. But what does research say? Well, this study found that alkaline diet enhances excretion of uric acid through urine. On the other hand, researchers found that acidic foods reduce excretion of uric acid. 
Another study affirms that alkaline diets can help reduce uric acid in the body. And they can prevent uric acid crystallization in joints. 
Note that more research needs to be conducted on effect of diet on uric acid crystal. 
Eat these alkaline foods 
You simply need to reduce intake of acidic foods and eat more alkaline foods. Alkaline foods are mostly vegetables and legumes. Red pepper",1

And God said, “Let there be light! “Let the earth bring forth grass, the herb, and the fruit tree yielding fruit”. 
And God saw that it was good. 
And Satan said, “There goes the neighborhood”! 
God then created man and woman and saw that they were lean and fit. 
God populated the earth with broccoli, cauliflower, spinach, and green and yellow vegetables. 
Satan said, “ I know how I can get back in this game”, and created the cheeseburger. 
And man said, “Supersize the fries”, and gained 5 pounds. 
Satan brought forth chocolate and Woman gained 5 pounds.

5 Reasons to Consume this Every Day,"Keywords: Alzhemier's disease , anxiety , dementia , depression , food , health , IBD , IBS , immune system , mental health , nutrition , weight loss Fermented Foods: 5 Reasons to Consume this food Group Every Day 
I’m sure you have heard about fermented foods and are wondering if this is just a fad. Here are some reasons why fermented foods should not be just a fad but a food group to keep in your diet daily. What are Fermented Foods? 
Bacteria and yeast are used as part of the fermentation process that gives these foods a nutritional boost. The bacteria convert sugars and starches into lactic acid through a process called lacto-fermentation. The yeast undergoes a process called ethanol fermentation. 
These yeasts and bacteria that undergo the fermentation process boosts the nutritional content of the food. What it does to the food Provides beneficial bacteria that promote gut health Provides beneficial enzymes Increases the amount of B vitamins, biotin, and folate. Increases the bioavailability of minerals. Provides short chain fatty acids (which helps to improve your immune function) Provides you with GABA, your calming neurotransmitter How can eating fermented foods help me? Optimize your Gut Health 
Why this may not seem like a big deal, it is. Your immune system is in your gut and much of your serotonin is made in your gut. Your gut may be in bad shape from NSAIDS, antibiotics, unknown food allergies, the standard American diet and more. 
Ideally you want more “good” bacteria populating your gut as opposed to “bad” bacteria. Fermented foods can help shift the balance since most people who consume the Standard American “crap food” diet have a disrupted microbiome. 
So, you can take all the supplements in the world, but if your gut is in bad shape, are you even absorbing and benefiting from these supplements or are you just wasting your money? 
A healthy gut can help to balance and support your endocrine system, immune system, digestive system, and nervous system. So, as you can see, a healthy gut is critical to your well-being. Support your Immune System 
The more beneficial bacteria you have, the stronger your immune system is to fight off colds, flu, allergies and more. Almost 80% of your immune system is found in your gut, thus, it stands to reason that to maintain a strong immune system, one needs to support their gut health. 
Asthma and autoimmune conditions, among numerous other health issues, are all linked to having fewer good bacteria in your gut. The less diverse your microbiota is, the greater association with many chronic health issues. 
Adding in probiotic rich fermented foods can also shorten the duration of a cold or upper respiratory infection. Aid in weight loss 
Studies show that those with certain healthy bacteria in their gut can maintain a healthy weight while those with more negative strains have a greater incidence of gaining weight/difficulty losing weight. Obese people have different gut bacteria than lean individuals. 
In a 2011 study, it was found that kimchee had a significant impact on weight and body fat of those who are overweight and obese in the study. In a 2010 study, obese people were assigned to drink fermented milk for 12 weeks. Those that drank the fermented milk had significant fat loss as compared to the control group. Digestive/Bowel Issue Improvement 
Those with IBS or IBD may have reduced symptoms of diarrhea and constipation when fermented foods are added into the daily diet. Dr. David Williams states that to eliminate digestive issues, you need to improve the balance in the gut microbiome and one of the most effective ways of doing so is by adding in fermented foods. Kefir in studies, has shown to improve symptoms of IBS and IBD. Research has shown that anywhere from 50 to 75% of those who make this change (Adding in fermented foods) will notice a significant difference in their IBS symptoms. Improved mental health, mood control and behavior. 
The gut is considered your second brain. A healthy gut therefore can mean a healthy brain. Several probiotic strains have been shown to reduce symptoms of depression and anxiety in short term studies. For this reason, to get more variety of probiotic strains, it is best to not stick with the same fermented food to eat over and over. Mix it up; for instance, have kefir one day, kombucha the next, fermented vegetables the next day and so forth. 
Many of you know that GABA is your calming neurotransmitter. But did you know that fermented foods can supply you with GABA too? Oral administration of fermented rice bran and other traditional fermented foods have been shown to increase GABA content significantly! Whereas GABA in the oral form may have limited benefits due to absorption issues. 
Another study looking at 700 college students found that those who ate a variety of fermented foods has less negative emotions than before such as anxiety, fear, moodiness, worry, envy, frustration, and loneliness. 
It is possible that the fermented foods not only healed leaky gut but also provided some needed GABA. Even in psychiatry they are starting to recognize the benefits of fermented foods for mood disorders. Reduce the risk of brain diseases such as Alzheimer’s. 
Some scientists have recently begun to consider the possibility that Alzheimer’s Disease is in fact an autoimmune disease. And as many of you may know, having one autoimmune condition puts you at risk for more autoimmune conditions down the road. For any autoimmune disease, the immune system must be supported. So, it would make sense that gut health needs to be addressed for AD. If you want to support your brain than I suggest that you add in fermented foods. 
Along with the benefits above, fermented foods can also benefit those with Autism and help prevent H-Pylori. You don’t need a whole lot of fermented foods daily. Start with small amounts until you know how your body will react and slowly build your way up to say 3 tablespoons of fermented vegetables or a cup of kefir per day. What to add in 

Look for the product to say raw and fermented. These foods should be in the refrigerator section of the store. Sauerkraut or other fermented vegetables : eat these cold, don’t heat them up. Bubbies pickles is a great way to get introduced to fermented foods. Kimchee : this is a Korean version of fermented cabbage, carrots, onions and garlic. Kefir: usually made from cow’s milk but is also made from goat milk or coconut milk. It has more of a drinkable texture than yogurt. I buy goat milk kefir and find that it is relatively thick and mix in some of my paleo granola and have this for breakfast. If you suspect any issues with milk it is best to opt for the coconut kefir or the goat milk kefir. If you have asthma or chronic sinus congestion, avoid the kefir until issues resolve. Opt for the other fermented choices instead. Tempeh: Indonesian type of “cake” with a nutty taste and chewy texture. A good vegan source of protein too. Kombucha : a fizzy fermented tea. Most stores carry a variety of flavors now. Don’t go overboard on the kombucha however. Some people who drink kombucha in excess amounts (i.e.: several bottles per day) report symptoms of gas and bloating. Miso: a fermented soybean paste which can be used in soups and sauces. A miso broth soup is a great way to start a meal and very easy to make. 
Notice I did not sat yogurt. While some yogurts may contain some probiotics, many others are sugary processed foods in disguise. Yogurt is also not going to pack as powerful of a punch as the above-mentioned foods.

This Simple Daily Tip Can Improve Your Health And Jumpstart Weightloss,"What we all should be doing first thing in the morning A simple, cheap and effective way to jump start your metabolism, weight loss and improve your health 
What if I told you that by doing this every day, making it part of your morning routine just like brushing your teeth, would help you to lose weight, flush out toxins, hydrate your body and skin, improve brain function, give you more energy and decrease your appetite, would you do it? 
Drinking water upon rising in the morning can have huge health benefits! Some people call it water therapy and has its origination in Ayurvedic medicine. It is purported to help with numerous diseases such as cancer, asthma, high blood pressure, arthritis, diabetes and migraines. 
To reap the benefits, drink the water upon waking (ideally 45 minutes before you eat) and make it part of your morning routine. Most us are walking around in a dehydrated state. So, start your day off the right way! 
Ideally filtered water that is void of chemicals and fluoride is best. I personally like the Berkey filter system as this is affordable for many instead of a whole house system. Most water pitchers are ineffective for removing most of the chemicals in our water but there are a couple good ones out there such as the “Clearly Filtered” pitcher. But even if you don’t have a water filter system, it does not mean you should not drink up. 
For most people 16 oz. of water in the morning is the right amount. Others say to drink double this amount. This may be a lot of water to consume for most people first thing in the morning. My suggestion would be to start out with 8 oz. and slowly work your way up to the higher amount and see how you feel. Moderation is key as too little or too much water is never a good thing. 
The 8 glasses filled with 8 oz. of water is a myth and no science behind this reasoning. Another simple rule is to divide your body weight in half and drink this amount in ounces. But if you are a large person, this may feel like you are spending your day drinking water! 
Instead focus on getting that glass of water first thing in the day and then add in water, herbal teas, fruits and vegetables during the day. If your urine is very pale yellow throughout the day, then you are hydrated. If it is a bright yellow to orange, drink up! Riboflavin, a B vitamin can make your urine a bright yellow. Benefits to drinking water first thing in the morning It can jump start your metabolism 
It can increase your metabolism by 24% for the first 90 minutes after consuming that glass of water. Another study showed that it can increase your metabolic rate by 30% for the next 40 minutes after the water is consumed. Hydration This is more important that you think. When dehydrated, we may experience brain fog, lack of energy and metal clarity. Hydrating in the morning can increase the flow of oxygen which is energizing. Hydrating will also help the skin to look younger. Flushes out toxins 
Support your kidneys by helping them to flush out toxins and give your body the water it needs first thing in the a.m. Speed up the detox process by adding a tablespoon of lemon juice to your morning water. This is best done prior to brushing your teeth in the morning as the film on your teeth will protect the enamel from the acidity in the lemon juice. Support brain health 
Your brain tissue is 75% water. Not having enough water can make you feel tired, drained and can cause mood swings. Prevent you from overeating Just by drinking water you feel full. Studies show that those who consume water before every meal lost an average of 4.5 pounds over a three-month period. That’s with no dieting, not changing your eating habits-just adding in water. Less colds and Flu 
Staying hydrated helps to maintain the health of your lymphatic system which also affects how your body fights off infection. 
If you are looking for a simple, cheap and effective way to improve your health and stimulate weight loss, then this is it!

Lower Back Pain: How to Treat It Efficiently,"Arthritis(inflammation of one or more joint) Illness A spine problem you were born with. Fibromyalgia (a disorder that causes fatigue and muscle pain) Compression fractures 
To get quick and effective relief from back pain, you can follow some tips mentioned over here to get rid of this irritating pain. 
Sometimes back pain is serious. In such conditions, it’s obvious that you will call your doctor. But for routine and mild back pain, you can do some home remedies for quick relief . 
Ice & Heat to the Rescue In first 24-48 hours of an injury, ice is best as it reduces inflammation. Use ice for about 20 minutes on your back then take it off to give your back skin rest. If pain persists, talk to a doctor. After 48 hours you can switch to heat if you prefer. But in first 48 hours when you have acute pain, an ice pack is only recommended. 
Move Your Spines 
Our body is made to move, so does our spine. Keep doing your daily life activities to feel better. Go to work, make the beds, walk the pet. If you are in a state to do aerobic exercises such as bicycling, swimming and walking then carefully do them. Just don’t overdo it. You can keep your back pain in mobile by doing so. 
Exercise and Stretch 
Regular physical activity keeps you away from this types of pain. A simple exercise like walking, running can be proved very helpful in healing such pain. It is advisable to consult your physician for a list of exercises suitable for your age and health conditions. 
Stretch: Apart from exercise, stretch helps you recover from back pain quickly. Always stretch before any physical activity or exercise to warm up yourself. Also, stretch for 10-15 minutes before going to bed. Sitting for long hours in a desk chair all day and bending forward after every other minute to see monitor or file is the reason of back pain in office goers. If you are among those people, then don’t forget to stretch your legs and do office yoga to get rid of this pain. 
Massage Your Back 
Heat some sesame oil or coconut oil on a low flame with eight cloves of garlic in it. Apply the mixture on the affected area and massage it thoroughly for at least 10-15 minutes . Leave it for 3-4 hours then wash it off with warm water or if you wish you can take a bath of warm water. 
If you do not want to do so much effort, then mix some camphor in your massage oil and apply it to your back. 
To help keep your back healthy and avoid further pain: 
Sleep Well 
Bad posture while sleeping often causes back pain. Always sleep on your side and firm surface rather than on soft mattresses like an amerisleep mattress. If you feel back pain on a regular interval, then t here are mattresses available in the market, especially for back pain patients. 
Always sit in a chair that is designed to keep your back straight and practice good posture when you stand. 
Healthy Weight 
It has often seen that overweight is the cause of back pain. Our ribs and area above the legs already bear most of the body’s weight, and when you are overweight, it puts extra weight on that part of our body. So, eat fruits and green vegetables and avoid eating processed food. Hit gym regularly to get your body lean and toned. 
Also, avoid lifting heavy weights. 
Calcium 
As you know, calcium makes our bones strong. It also protects your spine from osteoporosis. Eating calcium-rich foods in your diet such as milk and dairy products, finger millet, green leafy veggies, sesame, small fish with bones, etc. reduce the chances of getting serious lower back pain. So, increase your calcium intake. 
Change Your Lifestyle 
If you work in an office , bend forward after every few minutes and sit for longer hours then keep stretching and doing office yoga at work to avoid getting lower back pain.

Interesting & Fun Facts About Stethoscope,"Keywords: medical equipment , Stethoscope facts , stethoscopes history 
When we hear the word “Doctor,” the first image comes in our mind is a person in a white coat with a stethoscope hanging around his neck. The stethoscope has become a very common name amongst people thanks to its display in various T.V shows, movies and frequent use of it by doctors. But still, there are many fun facts which other people might not know about stethoscope. So here they are – 
200 years old history – Yes! Stethoscopes are one of the oldest inventions which are still being used across the world by millions of doctors. Rene Laennec in 1819 had invented the stethoscope. It was a wooden instrument and looked quite different from what we see it as now. 
I see your chest – Stethoscope is a Greek word which roughly translates into “I see the chest,” stethos means chest and scope mean examination. 
An Interesting story behind its Invention – When Stethoscope was not invented, doctors would put their ears around the chest of patients and gently tap the chest with fingers. This technique would make female patients little uncomfortable. Rene Laennec was a very shy person. Once he was examining an overweight woman. He found it difficult to hear her hear sounds. To hear heartbeats of that lady, he rolled a quire paper into a tube and placed it on her chest. This inspired him to make the device which we all are familiar with and called stethoscope. 
Google Doodle For Rene Laennec – On February 17th, 2016, Rene Laennec would have celebrated his 235th birthday. To commemorate this day, Google doodle marked his 235th birthday. 
Used To Identify If A Person Is Dead Or Not 
Nowadays stethoscope is used to hear heart sounds and to determine symbols of other diseases. But initially, stethoscope was designed to find out if the person in the hospital is dead or alive. 
It Might Be Replaced Very Soon 
As mentioned, stethoscopes were invented almost 200 years ago and being in use for such a long time shows that how useful and efficient stethoscopes are. However, as the technology is getting advanced every passing day, stethoscopes might be replaced very soon by pocket-sized ultrasonic devices which can perform multiple measurements on patients.

"Cranberry Juice Does Not Prevent Urinary Tract Infection, New Study Finds","Keywords: cranberries , cranberry , cranberry juice , kidney disease , urinary tract infections , UTI , UTIs 
Cranberry juice and tablets have been recommended as a way to either prevent recurring urinary tract infection (UTI), or treat the symptoms. But a new study finds there’s no difference between people treated with cranberries or placebos. 
A lack of evidence for cranberry juice or capsules as being an effective preventative measure or treatment has been a recurring argument in the scientific literature for years now. Cranberry Juice – An Unrealistic Recommendation for UTIs 
A urinary tract infection occurs when bacteria gets into your urine and travels up to your bladder. According to the Urinary Care Foundation , “UTIs cause more than 8.1 million visits to health care providers each year. About 10 in 25 women and 3 in 25 men will have symptoms of at least [one] UTI during their lifetime.” 
For years now, cranberry juice has been recommended to aid in preventing or treating UTIs. However, there’s no solid evidence that any amount is having a positive effect. 
Additionally, based on the results of a recent study led by infectious disease specialist Manisha Juthani-Mehta from the Yale School of Medicine, even if you switch to highly concentrated capsules, you still don’t see a noticeable positive effect. 
In response to this recent study, Lindsay E. Nicolle, an expert on UTIs from the University of Manitoba advises the following: 
“The continuing promotion of cranberry use to prevent recurrent UTI in the popular press or online advice seems inconsistent with the reality of repeated negative studies or positive studies compromised by methodological shortcomings.” 
Nicolle adds, “[C]linicians should not be promoting cranberry use by suggesting that there is proven, or even possible benefit. Any continued promotion of the use of cranberry products seems to go beyond available scientific evidence and rational reasoning. It is time to move on from cranberries.” Myth versus Facts 
There’s a couple of reasons why the myth that cranberry juice is beneficial in preventing and treating UTIs has persisted for so long. 
First, the active ingredient in cranberries — A-type proanthocyanidins (PACs) — has been shown to block the adhesion of bacteria to the wall of the bladder. So, a vast majority of people have reasoned that if bacteria are causing UTIs, something that blocks bacteria from accumulating in the bladder could be a potential preventive or treatment measure. 
But, according to Timothy Boone, M.D., Ph.D., vice dean of the Texas A&M Health Science Center College of Medicine Houston campus and chairperson of the department of urology for Houston Methodist Hospital, there’s one problem . 
“Cranberry juice, especially the juice concentrates you find at the grocery store, will not treat a UTI or bladder infection, It can offer more hydration and possibly wash bacteria from your body more effectively, but the active ingredient in cranberry is long-gone by the time it reaches your bladder.” 
Dr. Boone adds, “It takes an extremely large concentration of cranberry to prevent bacterial adhesion. This amount of concentration is not found in the juices we drink. There’s a possibility it was stronger back in our grandparents’ day, but definitely not in modern times.” 
For example, Ocean Spray’s cranberry juice cocktail is only 27 percent juice. Something so watered down could not be so ineffective. 
The second reason the myth continues is that it’s a tempting myth to believe. If you experience recurring UTIs and want to prevent them — or you want to feel empowered while you’re waiting for the antibiotics to take effect — drinking cranberry juice or taking capsules is a fairly easy and simple way to feel like you’re helping resolve your problem. 
Unfortunately, though, you’re paying a lot of money for something that’s only really doing the same job as a glass of water. And cranberry juice is full of sugar anyway. Golden Rules for Kidney Health 
You can do a number of things to help keep your kidneys functioning properly at every stage of life. 
Here’s a list of ways to reduce the risk of kidney disease – including urinary tract infections. Drink plenty of liquids, especially water . Drinking water helps dilute your urine and ensures that you’ll urinate more frequently — allowing bacteria to be flushed from your urinary tract before an infection can begin. Stay active and keep fit . Keeping fit helps to reduce your blood pressure. Staying active and keeping fit also reduces the risk of chronic kidney disease. Eat healthy and keep your weight in check . This can help prevent diabetes, heart disease, and other debilitating conditions associated with chronic kidney disease. Reduce your salt intake . The recommended sodium intake is 5-6 grams of salt per day — around a teaspoon. Try limiting the amount of processed and restaurant food. And don’t add salt to food. It’s easier to control your salt intake if you prepare the food yourself with fresh ingredients. Don’t take over-the-counter pills on a regular basis . Common non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs — like ibuprofen — are known to cause kidney damage and disease if taken regularly. This type of medication probably doesn’t pose considerable danger if your kidneys are reasonably healthy and you use them for emergencies only. However, if you are dealing with chronic pain — like back pain or arthritis — work with your doctor to find natural ways to control your pain without putting your kidneys at risk. Wipe from front to back . Doing so after urinating and after a bowel movement helps prevent bacteria in the anal region from spreading to the vagina and urethra. Change your birth control method . Diaphragms, or unlubricated or spermicide-treated condoms, can all contribute to bacterial growth. Avoid potentially irritating feminine products . Using deodorant sprays or other feminine products, such as douches and powders, in the genital area can irritate the urethra. Empty your bladder soon after intercourse . Also, drink a full glass of water to help flush bacteria. Regularly control of your blood sugar level . About half of people who have diabetes develop kidney damage, so it is important for people with diabetes to have regular tests to check their kidney functions.

Clinton operative 'Dirty' Donna Brazile is the kind of political filth we need to eradicate from Washington DC: She let Hillary Clinton CHEAT at the debates!,"Clinton operative 'Dirty' Donna Brazile is the kind of political filth we need to eradicate from Washington DC: She let Hillary Clinton CHEAT at the debates! 
Tuesday, November 01, 2016 Tags: Donna Brazile , cheating democrats , racketeering (NaturalNews) Dirty Donna Brazile. Political filth on display. The stench of dirty democrat tactics has now reached a new, nauseating milestone in America with the revelation that ""Dirty"" Donna Brazile, a DNC operative working for Clinton, smuggled debate questions out of CNN and handed them over to the Clinton camp before the debates ever took place so that Hillary Clinton could CHEAT.Yes, Hillary Clinton CHEATED in the debates. As I've said all along, they were 100% rigged by CNN, the ""Clinton News Network,"" which now functions as the propaganda front of the criminal Clinton cartel seeking to steal power by crushing the very concept of open, fair and free elections in America.""CNN commentator Donna Brazile, who is now the chair of the Democratic National Committee, [was] caught again passing debate questions from the network to the Clinton campaign during the Democratic primary,"" reports Breitbart.com .Dirty Donna Brazile was caught so blatantly that even CNN had to fire her to create the appearance that CNN is still engaged in something resembling ethical journalism. Funneling town hall and debate questions to Hillary Clinton days before the events... The Daily Caller adds even more stunning revelations to the depths of cheating carried out by Dirty Donna Brazile on behalf of the corrupt, criminal-minded Clintons: Donna Brazile, the interim chair of the Democratic National Committee, began providing town hall and debate questions to the Clinton campaign earlier than previously known, emails released by WikiLeaks on Monday show.The email threads also show that Brazile, a former CNN contributor, revealed to the Clinton campaign the name of the person who provided her with a question that was asked of Clinton at a March 13 town hall co-hosted by CNN and TV One. Brazile also shared a question from a debate hosted by CNN a week earlier.A March 12 email exchange shows Brazile stating that she received a town hall question from Roland Martin, a TV One host who co-moderated a March 13 town hall with CNN's Jake Tapper.A March 5 email shows that she shared a question with Clinton campaign chairman John Podesta and communications director Jennifer Palmieri that was to be asked in a March 6 debate hosted by CNN in Flint, Mich. ARREST Brazile, Mills, Podesta, Schultz, Abedin and Clinton What we are all witnessing here with these revelations about cheating, corruption, obstruction of justice, bribery and vote fraud is nothing less than the inner workings of a criminal cartel composed of a modern day political mafia .All these political scumbags need to go to jail. They are all guilty of serious crimes against the United States and against democracy itself. They respect no law. They follow no rules. They cheat, lie, deceive, steal and intimidate their way to power, election after election. They live as legally immune parasites feeding off the blood, sweat and tears of the American middle class who are barely staying afloat while Washington elitists like Brazile, Abedin and Clinton dine on luxury meals like a disturbing scene out of the Hunger Games .But it's not President Snow we have to worry about in the real world... it's the haunting possibility of a President Clinton. Why We the People must NEVER allow Hillary Clinton to seize the White House We the People must never allow Hillary Clinton to seize the White House. We must halt this sociopathic liar and cheater at the ballot box on November 8th. And once that's accomplished, we must petition President Trump to relentlessly pursue criminal indictments of the HUNDREDS of seditious traitors inside the Clinton regime who have blatantly violated numerous federal laws to commit massive fraud and attempted theft of power across America.There are literally hundreds of these democrat criminals who need to be locked up for life. They are a danger to democracy and a danger to a free society. They are sociopaths, liars, cheats and even murderers. They are fraudsters and political con artists who prey upon the weak-minded (i.e. democrats who are still so stupid and clueless that they're voting for Hillary ). If we don't stop them now, they threaten to turn America into a Fourth Reich , complete with the mass murder of political dissidents and the silencing of all critics of the Clinton regime.These democrats like Dirty Donna Brazile want to run America like Haiti , complete with all the corruption, bribery, scandals and economic collapse that Third World countries routinely suffer.But filthy scumbags like Brazile are about to find out something rather shocking: We the People won't tolerate your lies and corruption any longer! We the People are going to arrest you, indict you, prosecute you and see you and your co-conspirators behind bars where you belong. The Trump movement is awakening tens of millions of Americans to the astonishing criminality of the democrats in Washington There's an unstoppable movement rising up in America now that simply will not tolerate filthy democrats stealing our democracy and conning their way into power. If they steal the election, we will take to the streets and declare a Clinton presidency illegitimate and illegal . We will stand behind the military men and women in uniform as the U.S. armed forces depose you and remove you from office , to announce new elections without the festering, cancerous stench of the DNC and the Clintons hanging over this nation like a putrid cloud of filth.We the People have had enough of you demons, you creatures from Hell, you walking bags of anti-human reptilian snakes who pretend to be ""leaders"" in Washington. Your days of tyranny and totalitarian domination are rapidly coming to an end. And you will soon face the informed justice of an enraged population that refuses to be enslaved by your incessant corruption and wretched government rackets.From Breitbart.com : Racketeering: Former prosecutor Andrew McCarthy has recently observed that Hillary Clinton's abuse of the State Department looks an awful lot like a ""racketeering enterprise,"" which could trigger the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act of 1971, more widely known as RICO. McCarthy explained:Under RICO, an ""enterprise"" can be any association of people, informal or formal, illegitimate or legitimate  it could be a Mafia family, an ostensibly charitable foundation, or a department of government. It is a racketeering enterprise if its affairs are conducted through ""a pattern of racketeering activity."" A ""pattern"" means merely two or more violations of federal or state law; these violations constitute ""racketeering activity"" if they are included among the extensive list of felonies laid out in the statute. It's time to defeat Clinton , followed by arresting all the Clinton operatives and initiating hundreds of federal prosecution cases against these Third World fraudsters. That's how we take back America, restore democracy and regain public trust in law and order. NOTE TO THE FEDS: Arrest the democrat criminals or lose any semblance of legal authority in America REMEMBER: If federal authorities do not arrest and prosecute the Clintons and all their co-conspirators, they essentially forfeit any real claim to legitimate legal authority. At that point, the citizens will realize they no longer have any logical obligation to pay federal taxes, obey federal laws, abide by federal regulations or consent to be governed by anybody in Washington at all.After all, a nation run by a system that refuses to hold its leaders accountable for their criminal conduct is a nation that can no longer claim to operate under the rule of law. At that point, ""justice"" becomes a sad, tragic joke against the citizens, and the nation soon finds itself on the verge of a mass citizens' revolt. If the FBI won't seek criminal indictments against Hillary Clinton and her criminal cohorts, sooner or later the military or the citizens will do it for them .

Common painkillers linked to increased heart failure risk,"Common painkillers linked to increased heart failure risk 
Tuesday, November 01, 2016 by: L.J. Devon, Staff Writer Tags: heart failure , pain management , antioxidants (NaturalNews) When elderly patients with joint problems start taking common painkillers such as ibuprofen and naproxen, their risk of heart failure increases. This is the finding of a UK study published in the British Medical Journal . The study investigated 10 million people with an average age of 77 from the UK, the Netherlands, Italy and Germany. Those who took non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) were rushed to the hospital with heart failure 19 percent more often than those who did not take the drugs. The same awful correlation was not made for those under the age of 65, but the study does point out that serious health problems are being ignored and numbed by painkillers. Dealing with the root cause of inflammation is more important for long-term health Regular use of NSAIDs is becoming a popular strategy to help manage pain later in life. Using these over-the-counter painkillers may take the edge off the pain, but continued use does not deal with the problems that are causing the inflammation in the first place. And old age is not the reason for the pain.For this reason, elderly patients could benefit more from natural anti-inflammatory substances that work with the body's healing process. Over time, giving the body phyto-nutrients such as astaxanthin, curcumin and capsicum do much greater damage repair than NSAIDs. These plant based medicines go after the free radicals that are causing damage at the cellular level.Numbing the pain is not enough, and allows heart conditions to go unnoticed, leading to heart failure . Pain within the joints and tissues is a signal to the conscious self that there is indeed a breakdown, an imbalance, or a deficiency. When NSAIDs are thrown at the problem regularly, there can only be a numbing of the real problems that the elderly patient faces. When the correct nutrients are absorbed and toxins are removed, then the root problem sending the message of pain can be repaired. Better pain management essential for the elderly Flu shots and other vaccines containing aluminum are pushed on the elderly as ""medicine."" The aluminum acts as an inflammatory adjuvant to trigger the immune system to respond to the virus material in the vaccine. The inflammation and genetic damage that aluminum is known to cause may be exacerbating pain in elderly patients and causing damage to their nervous systems.Natural substances that repair the nervous and immune systems would be better advised for the elderly population. However, the medical system and the common patient do not understand how to use substances such as phenolic compounds that come from plants. These real life medicines possess antioxidant properties that act as therapeutic agents to counteract oxidative stress. Something as simple as Siberian ginseng ( Eleutherococcus senticosus ) can be included in the diet to provide greater mental and physical stamina. This root contains a powerful combination of sterols, coumarins, flavonoids and polysaccharides that lessen the effect of stress on the body, allowing one to adapt to high stress situations and manage pain more effectively.

The truth about Zika: It's a grand medical hoax,"The truth about Zika: It's a grand medical hoax 
Monday, October 31, 2016 by: J. D. Heyes Tags: Zika virus , medical hoax , infectious disease (NaturalNews) One of the most interesting things about the Zika virus is that it is not a new ailment. It was first discovered in monkeys in 1947 and in humans in 1952, according to a fact sheet from the World Health Organization .While researchers have admittedly probably learned more about the virus since it was first identified, some of the health problems now being associated with Zika – such as microcephaly in newborns – have never before been seen, leaving many to wonder if there isn't some sort of conspiracy being devised by globalists to suit their political agenda.For instance, according to TruthWiki , an investigative site that has recently delved into the history of the disease, populations in the past that were heavily infected with Zika never reported a single case of a newborn with a shrunken head. The current outbreak is far from being the only one. In the 1960s, outbreaks occurred in Oceania and Southeast Asia. And in 2007, the so-called ""Yap epidemic,"" which occurred on the Yap main island – part of the Caroline Island chain in the Western Pacific – infected three-quarters of the population. But no cases of newborn birth defects, like microcephaly, were reported. So the current hysteria over microcephaly allegedly being tied to Zika appears completely unwarranted. Will we see another 'swine flu fiasco' with the Zika vaccine? The same year, TruthWiki reported, using funding that was provided by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, a genetically altered version of the virus was developed by Oxitec (Oxford Insect Technologies), a British biotechnology company. Roughly two years later, in the fall of 2009, Gates helped usher in the first outdoor trials of genetically modified transgenic Aedes aegypti mosquitoes, which are the species known to transmit the disease. They were released ostensibly to fight the spread of mosquito-borne diseases including dengue, yellow fever and Zika , among others. The plan was to get the GM mosquitoes to mate with females to produce offspring that would die soon after birth, thereby halting the spread of the disease. But, TruthWiki noted, there was another agenda.In May 2014, the WHO and the Brazilian government colluded to spread propaganda that there were nearly 1 million ""suspected"" cases of Zika in Brazil, and recommended that the deadly poison pyroproxyfen be spread, to include areas of drinking water. The propaganda disseminated was that since mosquitoes were breeding in those areas of standing water, then they too had to be treated with the chemical, which was then spread primarily over poverty-stricken areas.The next thing we know, scores of cases involving microcephaly in Brazil began cropping up. And they were then blamed on Zika. Coincidence? Many think not. What's more, there were really only about 500 children born malformed – not 5,000-plus as originally reported, TruthWiki points out.As TruthWiki notes further, Zika is a mild viral infection – always has been – and resembles the typical cold or flu. Most of those afflicted with it suffer a low-grade fever, some pain in their joints, a skin rash and conjunctivitis. In other cases, people have no idea they've even been infected. If symptoms appear at all, they may last up to a week. But like chicken pox, a one-time Zika infection can provide lifelong immunity. While severe cases of Zika may require hospitalization, they are rare, as are Zika-related deaths. Overkill? And yet, despite the virus' relatively mild symptoms, the U.S. government is set to pay a Japanese Big Pharma firm as much as $300 million to develop a vaccine , Natural News reported recently. If that's not overkill, then nothing is – especially given the fact that most vaccines contain harmful substances and preservatives .Another disease outbreak ""emergency."" Another vaccine with even more harmful chemicals and preservatives will go on the market. In fact, due to the ""gravity"" and ""dire nature"" of the Zika emergency, we may even see mandatory vaccination as we did with the swine flu fiasco in the mid-1970s. Then, a mandatory program of vaccination for the illness, which only killed one person, led to a dramatic spike in Guillain-Barre syndrome, in which the immune system attacks the nerves, causing paralysis. Ironically, today the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is claiming that Zika may be causing GBS.Propaganda anyone?Read the entire TruthWiki report on the Zika hoax here . Sources:",1
THE END GAME closes in on the Clintons as the deep state turns... massive collection of criminally damning evidence about to be revealed that will bring down the Clinton crime family forever,"THE END GAME closes in on the Clintons as the deep state turns... massive collection of criminally damning evidence about to be revealed that will bring down the Clinton crime family forever 
Wednesday, November 02, 2016 Tags: deep state , Clinton cartel , damning evidence (NaturalNews) My fellow Americans, we are watching history unfold before us with such sound and fury that we are likely to never witness comparable events again in our lifetime. As of today, I am now convinced that the deep state has turned on Hillary Clinton and will unveil damning evidence in the next few days that will end the Clintons' reign of terror over America and collapse her bid for the presidency.The mainstream media, of course, will never report this news for the simple reason that they are the propaganda arm of the criminal Clinton cartel. As such, they will lie to the public to the bitter end, even as the Clinton Titanic sinks with all of them on board (in deep, frigid waters, no less, with no more lifeboats to be found).The so-called ""deep state"" -- the powerful insiders who really run the intelligence services and inner layers of untouchable bureaucracy -- has decided Hillary Clinton is too damaged to defend any longer . Even if she were to win by stealing the election, she would be so mired in criminal investigations and political illegitimacy that she would rip the nation to shreds while fighting for her own political survival.It has now been decided, I believe, that Hillary Clinton will be taken out of power by releasing criminally damaging emails which have long been held by the NSA and FBI. This will likely happen before the coming weekend. Once that is accomplished, the next goal will be to wait for President Trump to take office, then destroy the U.S. economy through a controlled, global debt collapse so that Trump can be blamed for the near collapse of western economies. (Remember: The deep state isn't pro-Trump. They're still all about defending the establishment. But Hillary is one bridge too far for even the statists to stomach...)Instead of allowing Hillary Clinton to take power and destroy America from the top, in other words, deep state power brokers have reverted to ""Plan B"" which is to let Trump take the White House, then destroy America through the controlled demolition of its currency and economy. This is simpler than it sounds. Bringing down the debt pyramid of a nation carrying nearly $20 trillion in national debt isn't exactly rocket science. All they have to do is stand back and stop manipulating the markets and stop printing new money for a few months while raising interest rates. Monetary gravity will do the rest...In the mean time, Hillary Clinton and a long list of her co-conspirators are going to find themselves charged with obstruction of justice , lying under oath, destruction of evidence, conspiracy, corruption and other serious charges that will lead to serious prison time for many.The criminal racket of the Clintons is about to implode. The participants will be charged under the RICO Act for ""racketeering"" activities, for which ample evidence already exists. A new video from Steve Pieczenik describes some of this In this video, intelligence insider Steve Pieczenik lays out how high-level intelligence insiders are now working in concert to ""reverse the Clinton coup"" that's attempting to take over America and destroy it from within.Even if you don't believe Pieczenik -- and I fully realize he's controversial in his own way -- this short video is a very important ""must watch"" explanation to know what people in the intelligence community are doing... ""we've initiated a counter-coup..."" The Clintons are going to go ""full murder"" in a last ditch, desperate effort to save themselves Beware of what may yet unfold in the coming days. Like a cornered wild animal, the Clintons are extremely dangerous when they realize they have nothing to lose by going ""full murder"" in an attempt to save themselves.I will not be surprised the least bit if bodies of people in high places start piling up over the next week. Watch for news reports of mysterious car crashes, swimming pool accidents or ""natural"" deaths involving people like James Comey, who'd better have armed security personnel around him at all times.Look for desperate measures such as the Clintons attempting to blackmail Obama, Comey or anyone who they think might serve as leverage to save their own skins. We might also see desperate false flag attacks unfold in the next few days, although that's increasingly unlikely since it seems the Clintons are now on their own (they would need the assistance of Obama to pull off another Sandy Hook, you see). A deal has already been struck with Obama Most likely, deep state operatives have already struck a deal with Obama to avoid prosecuting him for his own serious crimes as long as he stays out of the way as Hillary Clinton's head is served up on a platter. This likely explains why Obama is now publicly saying he trusts Comey (and refuses to go to bat for Hillary). There's no love lost between Obama and the Clintons (remember 2008?).As all this is going down, the propaganda ministry of the Clinton regime -- CNN, NYT, Washington Post, etc. -- is going to explode into an all-out ""bat-s##t crazy"" conspiracy theory phase where they blame the Russians, extraterrestrials, Bigfoot and the Loch Ness Monster for everything that's imploding around the Clintons. Mainstream media news reports are going to increasingly sound like sociopathic babble from crazy people grasping at whatever outlandish theories they can invoke. Maybe crop circles were created by the Russians as a secret code to Wikileaks and Donald Trump, eh?Meanwhile, conspiratorial operatives like George Stephanopoulos fully realize they are probably going to jail for collusion and sedition , so they have nothing left to lose by desperately trying to put Hillary in the White House via any means at their disposal, including totally faking negative news against Donald Trump (which is, of course, the entire news mission of CNN at this point, a disgraced propaganda network run by anti-American traitors). If the vote is stolen for Hillary Clinton, all hell breaks loose Should the globalist Soros operators manage to steal the vote, bribe the electoral voters or rig the black box voting machines sufficiently to place Hillary Clinton in the White House, all Hell breaks loose across America :• The FBI goes into full indictment mode to push criminal charges for the Clinton criminal regime.• Donald Trump launches a massive legal challenge to the election outcome, dispatching an army of lawyers to level a vast assortment of charges involving coordinated voter fraud, the rigging of voting machines, the attempted bribery of Electoral voters and so on.• The U.S. military revs up its plans for an armed military coup to depose Clinton and restore democracy. This one should be especially entertaining to watch unfold if it gets activated... (and yes, YOU will beg for a short-term military dictatorship as long as they promise to depose Clinton and restore open, fair and free elections).• Armed U.S. citizens prepare for a massive march on Washington to take back their democracy and restore a lawful society where the political elite don't get away with corruption, fraud and murder. Expect this march to be joined by police officers and federal law enforcement officials of all kinds.• The NSA likely goes into ""full dump"" mode to unleash every scrap of damning criminal evidence against Hillary Clinton. This will likely be joined by CIA assets who already have the goods on the Clintons and their ""Lolita Express"" pedo joy rides.• Wikileaks, Anonymous and every former NSA analyst goes into ""destroy the Clintons"" mode and begins to hack and expose every last shred of email evidence ever possessed by the Clintons and anyone close to them. Anonymous alone has enough technical clout to accomplish this with little or no outside help. (I expect Kim Dotcom to be aiding this entire effort as well, as he rightly holds extreme hatred toward Hillary Clinton... as do we all, come to think of it.)• The establishment Republicans in the U.S. Congress will, as usual, meekly surrender to the democrats, pulls down their britches and bend over to prepare to take it in the rear because that's what they do best when the going gets tough. Totally useless politicrats like John McCain can't get their pants around their ankles quickly enough when democrats start accusing them of something. These useless heaps of human baggage will be tossed out of Washington as the revolution unfolds, replaced with individuals who actually honor the U.S. Constitution (like Rep. Louie Gohmert). I root for all groups working to save America and expose the criminal politicians Bring out the marshmallows and weiners, folks: This is going to be the most bizarre campfire front row seat to U.S. history that anyone has witnessed in over 200 years. Try not to trip and ""face plant"" into the flames as all this unfolds. It might be a smart idea to have some preparedness supplies at the ready, since no one really knows just how nasty this is all going to get. (And thank God Hillary doesn't have her fingers on the nuclear launch codes, or she'd probably launch them just to change the narrative...)As for me, I'm with anybody who's trying to save America , restore democracy and throw the establishment criminals in prison. Like almost everybody else, I've had enough of the lies, the corruption, the media deceptions and the incessant blood sucking parasites in Washington D.C. who are too arrogant and stupid to realize just how much they're universally despised. The revolution is ON. Anonymous, Wikileaks, Project Veritas, the FBI and the NSA have all been activated. There's no stopping them now, and all the details of all the crimes of the Clintons are about to spill onto the stage of history, dirty deeds and all.Be warned, you are probably not psychologically prepared for the truth about what the Clintons really are. You will probably vomit. Health Ranger Approved AquaTru Water Filter Back in Stock

Food poverty: 49 million Americans struggle to put food on the table as Obama's economic schemes collapse,"Food poverty: 49 million Americans struggle to put food on the table as Obama's economic schemes collapse 
Wednesday, November 02, 2016 by: J. D. Heyes Tags: food poverty , hunger , Obama administration (NaturalNews) A Democratic presidential nominee – Hillary Clinton, who is by far the ""establishment candidate"" in this year's presidential race – wants to take over from another Democratic president, Barack Obama. She is promising to carry on his ""successful"" economic policies by promising to essentially double down on them .And yet, by any true measure, the economy has been a disaster under Obama. Real growth has nearly flat-lined , real unemployment figures – when a proper count is taken – is far higher than what is being ""officially"" posted by the administration , and 43 million Americans cannot get enough food without government assistance.In fact, on that last point and as reported by Natural Blaze , in the Obama economy, 1-in-6 Americans are going to bed hungry on most nights, if not every night.And Clinton wants to double down on Obama's economic policies? How can such a great economic recovery produce so many hungry Americans? For the past eight years, Americans have had to listen to lectures from Obama (and other Democrats) about how we, as a first-world nation, should be able to afford things like healthcare and offer a free college education to our citizens (and, increasingly, to non-citizens ). But shouldn't a nation that produces so much excess food each year that we export it to the tune of tens of billions of dollars be able to feed its people too?Of course. But malnutrition during the ""great economic recovery"" of the Obama years is rising at an alarming rate in the U.S. That's because in real terms, workers' wages are falling, and it is becoming more difficult for families and individuals to earn enough to put decent food on their tables.""For many, particularly the low paid [sic], this means two things: fuel and food poverty ,"" Natural Blaze reported.Low salaries combined with stagnant wages, jobs going to illegal immigrants and part-time work rising as Obamacare forces fewer companies to retain full-time employees, mean that food is increasingly seen as a luxury. And of those who can still afford food, many have to settle for cheap, nutrition-poor junk foods and foods high in starches, carbohydrates and calories. Now, winter approaches, and with it the inevitable supply challenges of natural gas and heating oil, which traditionally produce higher prices.But the establishment media is part of the problem. For example, in February Bloomberg reported that 1-in-7 Americans were on food stamps, despite an economic recovery . No one should ever be hungry in America unless they choose to be What recovery? Obama's economy is growing at about 1–2 percent a quarter – far below what is needed to sustain economic growth to the extent that it would lower our debt and provide well-paying jobs to the tens of millions needing them.So, the caveat is disingenuous. A more accurate story would have reflected on the 1-in-7 figure as it pertained to a real lack of opportunity among Americans to find better employment opportunities. In fact, the story makes no sense when you analyze it; either the economy is really good and a 1-in-7 ratio is no big deal, or the ratio is a big deal because the so-called economic recovery isn't reaching enough people. Which is it?It's the latter of course. And while America will always have a portion of the population that is too sick, too old or too lazy to produce – and they will be a net drain on the Treasury – the goal of any administration ought to be to adopt sound financial policies or to rescind policies that serve as impediments to economic growth. In today's America, that generally means thinning out the massive bureaucracy that is not only robbing millions of a better life because of their negative impact on business and industry, but is actually causing them to go hungry.And that should never happen in America. So why is it? Sources:",1
Woman awarded $70M after contracting cancer from Johnson & Johnson talcum powder,"Woman awarded $70M after contracting cancer from Johnson & Johnson talcum powder 
Wednesday, November 02, 2016 by: David Gutierrez, staff writer Tags: talc , ovarian cancer , jury award (NaturalNews) Once again, a St. Louis jury has ruled that Johnson & Johnson damaged women's health by engaging in a decades-long coverup about the potential risks of talcum powder (""baby powder"") as a feminine hygiene product. On October 27, Johnson & Johnson was ordered to pay $70.1 million to Deborah Giannecchini of Modesto, California, who received an ovarian cancer diagnosis in 2012.For 40 years, Giannecchini had used Johnson & Johnson's Baby Powder to keep her genital area dry, a use promoted by the company.The main ingredient in talcum powder is talc, a mineral widely used in paints and plastics as well as cosmetics, where it is used to absorb moisture. Some evidence suggests that regular exposure to talc, particularly in the genital area, can increase the risk of ovarian cancer.The jury found Johnson & Johnson guilty of negligence for failing to warn customers of this fact. Conspiracy to conceal risks Ovarian cancer is a rare but highly lethal disease. Well-established risk factors include obesity, not having children, estrogen therapy after menopause, and a family history of ovarian or breast cancer.The evidence linking talc to ovarian cancer is compelling but not yet conclusive. The International Agency for Research on Cancer lists talc as a ""possible"" carcinogen.Among the robust studies suggesting a connection are two meta-analyses that found a roughly one-third increase in ovarian cancer risk among women who were regularly exposed to talc . The first, published in 2003, found the connection in all cases. The second, published in 2013, found it only in women who applied talc directly to the genital area.The case marks the third guilty verdict against Johnson & Johnson over this issue. St. Louis juries have previously slapped the company with $55 million and $72 million judgments.The first case was filed by the family of Jackie Fox of Birmingham, Alabama, who had died of ovarian cancer after long-term use of talcum powder. In that case, the jury found the company guilty not just of negligence, but also of ""failure to warn and conspiracy to conceal the risks of its products.""Another 2,000 lawsuits are pending. Thirty years of deception Even after the recent verdict, Johnson & Johnson continues to insist on the safety of its product, including for genital use. In its home state of New Jersey, the company has successfully gotten two lawsuits over the issue dismissed. It is appealing all three guilty verdicts from Missouri.Investors seem to believe the company will prevail. Its stock price seemed unaffected by the recent guilty verdict.Alexandra Scranton, director of science and research at Women's Voices for the Earth, has characterized Johnson and Johnson's behavior as typical of Big Pharma and other companies that go to extreme lengths to keep selling products even as evidence mounts of their dangers.Scranton said that documents uncovered during the Fox trial show that for decades, Johnson & Johnson sought to take advantage of the scientific uncertainty over the talc-ovarian cancer link, downplaying the potential risk rather than pursing a ""clearly more ethical role, to take a precautionary approach."" Indeed, Scranton notes, the company ""poured money over years into defending talc.""Among the documents revealed during the Fox case are internal memos showing that Johnson & Johnson had been preparing to be sued over the health risks of talc for 30 years. In one 1997 memo, a medical consultant warned that anyone who continued to deny a connection between ovarian cancer and genital talc use would eventually be seen as on par with tobacco companies denying a cancer link: ""denying the obvious in the face of all evidence to the contrary.""Another memo laid out a strategy to counter falling talc sales caused by health concerns by more aggressive marketing to minority communities.

Americans' health deteriorating under Obamacare as life expectancies plunge,"Americans' health deteriorating under Obamacare as life expectancies plunge 
Wednesday, November 02, 2016 by: Ethan A. Huff, staff writer Tags: Americans , life expectancy , plummeting health (NaturalNews) For many years, the assumption has been that the United States leads the world as an advanced civilization, dominating in categories like education, quality of life, and life expectancy. But a new study released this year by the Society of Actuaries (SOA) paints a much different picture, suggesting that Americans are less healthy and will more than likely live much shorter lives compared to those in previous generations.The 36-page report reveals that the average 65-year-old American man today will most likely die just short of his 86th birthday, while the average 65-year-old American woman only has about two years longer until she dies, on average, around age 88. This might not sound like anything out of the ordinary, except that these figures are actually down compared to last year's report using the same criteria.Over the past several years, the report explains, American health has taken a major downturn. Life expectancy amongst 65-year-olds is down by about six months, on average. It's also down for younger Americans, who are likewise expected to live about six months less than in previous generations. In nearly every generational category, including ""Baby Boomers,"" ""Generation X,"" and ""Millennials,"" life expectancy is down, and will likely continue to go down.This is especially the case among middle-aged, non-Hispanic whites, who a recent study by Princeton University found are increasingly succumbing to the detrimental effects of bad habits like alcohol and drug abuse, unhealthy diet, and lack of exercise. This report also highlights increasing rates of suicide within younger populations, a sad state of affairs that says even more about the current state of our society.Mortality rates are still rising, the data suggests, but at an increasingly lower rate. And if things continue on the current trajectory, eventually overall life expectancy will be on the downturn – that is, unless the factors contributing to this decline are addressed and brought to bear. If they aren't, the average American life will likely continue to decline into the future. Pension payers, insurance companies see dollar signs as people die earlier While the study's findings have many applications in terms of social science research , the one area where they're making the biggest ripples involves employee pensions. By looking at this new life expectancy data through the lens of post-retirement disbursements, employers can determine whether or not their liabilities will increase or decrease – and based on the most current data, it appears that a decrease is on the way.""The updated scale provides the latest information to help accurately measure pension obligations,"" says Dale Hall, managing director of research at the SOA. ""However, it is up to pension plan sponsors, working with their plan actuaries, to determine how to incorporate emerging mortality improvement data into their plan valuations.""With the growing popularity of 401k accounts as opposed to pensions , the new data can also help employees who handle their own retirement affairs better ascertain how much they need to make, and how much they need to save, to live comfortably until their deaths. All of this information makes a difference when determining the price of annuities and insurance contracts whereby insurance companies are obligated to pay out until the time a person dies.Year-over-year changes in mortality are very volatile,"" Hall adds, noting that something as simple as a bad flu season can disrupt the death rate averages.At the same time, some experts claim that longevity rates in the long-term are still on an upward trajectory, and that soon-to-be retirees and younger folks alike need to take into account the fact that they could live much longer than the latest figures suggest, and to plan accordingly.

"This smart, harmless pesticide patent could take down Monsanto and change the world","This smart, harmless pesticide patent could take down Monsanto and change the world 
Wednesday, November 02, 2016 by: J. D. Heyes Tags: mushrooms , Monsanto , pesticides (NaturalNews) Is bio-agriculture giant Monsanto, king of genetically modified foods and seeds, about to suffer an irreversible decline while the planet Earth gets a huge chemical reprieve?Well, it may be a bit too early to declare the St. Louis-based corporation dead in the water, but that day may soon be upon us, thanks to a nifty new pesticide patent that would make BioAg chemicals unnecessary.As reported by the website Anonymous , one man who has dedicated his life to the study of mushrooms may have just stumbled upon the one invention that will dramatically change the way we protect food crops from voracious pests.Paul Stamets has unearthed medical cure after cure, and he says the key to saving the planet can be found in the mushroom.Stamets, one of the world's leading mycologists – if not the top researcher of fungi – filed a patent in 2001 that has since been all but ignored. Why? Because most of his research has been viewed as hostile to conventional industries, including the pesticide industry. Anonymous notes that some executives of the pesticide industry have remarked that the patent he filed was the most disruptive they had ever seen. Kills pests naturally and with zero impact on the environment And indeed, a read of the patent reveals a remarkable claim.""The present invention relates to the use of fungal mycelium as a biopesticide. More particularly, the invention relates to the control and destruction of insects, including carpenter ants, fire ants, termites, flies, beetles, cockroaches and other pests, using fungal mycelia as both attractant and infectious agent,"" the patent says.In other words, fungus that can be present on crops will both attract destructive pests and then infect and kill them after they have eaten it. In his patent, Stamets claims that more than one fungus can be used in combination, can be dried or freeze-dried, then packaged and reactivated for use ""as an effective bioinsecticide.""No more chemicals. No more spraying. No more need for Monsanto's chemical-first approach to growing our food.In his patent Stamets noted that the widespread use of chemical pesticides is a primary cause of a number of secondary environmental problems that occur besides the death of targeted pests. They include soil poisoning, the toxifying of underlying water tables and aquifers, as well as the pollution of surface water due to runoff.In addition, they lead to increases in cancer, allergies, neurological diseases, immune disorders Even the deaths of some agricultural workers and consumers have been linked to the use of chemical pesticides.Increasingly regulated and even banned in some countries, chemical pesticides like Monsanto's Roundup, with the cancer-causing primary ingredient glyphosate , have become so dangerous that many communities are scrambling for natural solutions to pest problems. Who knew mushrooms could be so lethal to pests? This guy did ""Compounding these problems, many pest type or vermin insects have developed a broad spectrum of resistance to chemical pesticides, resulting in few commercially available pesticides that are effective without thorough and repeated applications,"" the patent says. ""In addition to being largely ineffective and difficult and costly to apply, chemical pesticides present the further disadvantage of detrimental effects on non-target species, resulting in secondary pest outbreaks.""But his invention, he wrote, offers the agriculture industry an ""environmentally benign"" alternative to insect control by working to attract insects that latent preconidial mycelium that is fresh, dried or freeze-dried, that later infects and kills the host.Infected insects will then carry the fungal hyphae back to the central colony, then disperse the fungal pathogen even further.In essence, he wrote, fungal mycelium is both a bait/attractant as well as a food insecticide, and all without harming one thing in the environment.It's a harmless pesticide that works without genetically modifying our food, poisoning our earth and filling humans with toxins. Using just mushrooms.Now – who will step up and market it? You can bet it won't be Monsanto. Sources:",1
10 Reasons to drink lemon water on an empty stomach,"10 Reasons to drink lemon water on an empty stomach 
Wednesday, November 02, 2016 by: Amy Goodrich Tags: lemon water , detox , digestive health (NaturalNews) Fruit-infused water is extremely trendy right now. Celebrities such as Gwyneth Paltrow, Jennifer Aniston, and Beyonce swear by lemon water first thing in the morning. There are even entire diets based on this fruit. According to some health advocates, drinking lemon water on an empty stomach takes you one step closer to optimal health.But does swapping your morning coffee for this fashionably healthy lifestyle choice offer any significant benefit? Or is this just another health fad? Let's take a closer look at ten incredible reasons why you should start your day with a glass of lemon water. 1. Nutrient powerhouse While low in calories, lemons are loaded with health-promoting essential nutrients, including vitamin C, B-complex vitamins, calcium, iron, magnesium, potassium, and fiber. 2. Boosts immune system Vitamin C plays a major role in our immune system, and lemons are loaded with it. A strong and healthy immune system will help you keep bacterial and viral infections at bay. 3. Digestion aid The citric acid in lemon interacts with enzymes and acids involved in digestion. It stimulates digestion and the secretion of gastric juice. Furthermore, lemon juice loosens toxins in the digestive tract and may help relieve symptoms of indigestion such as bloating, burping, and heartburn. 4. Detoxifies your body Every day, we are subjected to a wide variety of chemicals and toxins present in the air we breathe, the water we drink, and the food we eat. While our body has its own cleansing systems, it is a good idea to put less stress on your already overworked body and give these cleansing mechanisms a boost. Lemon juice stimulates the liver by enhancing its enzyme function, thus helping your body to flush out more waste materials and toxins . 5. Boosts heart and brain health Thanks to its high level of potassium, lemon juice aids in the proper functioning of the nervous system. Furthermore, it has been shown to lower blood pressure which is a major risk factor for a heart attack. 6. Promotes glowing skin Lemons are packed with antioxidants. These little free radical fighting substances help to decrease blemishes and wrinkles for a rejuvenated, radiant skin. When applied to the skin, lemons can also reduce the appearance of scar tissue and age spots. 7. Weight loss aid While lemon juice might not be a weight loss miracle on its own, its high levels of pectin fibers curb the appetite and will help you to eat less at main meals. 8. Fights inflammation Lemon water possesses strong anti-inflammatory properties to soothe a sore throat or inflamed tonsils. Additionally, it removes uric acid from the joints, which is one of the main contributors to chronic pain and inflammation. 9. Boosts energy levels Lemons energize the body and fight feelings of depression and anxiety. So instead of having a coffee in the morning why not try a glass of lemon juice instead? 10. Hydrates your body After a night of hard work, your body is dehydrated and in desperate need of water. Lemon juice provides your body with the much-needed water and electrolytes (potassium, calcium, and magnesium) to rehydrate body tissue and flush out more toxins and waste materials.While lemon water seems to be the perfect drink to prevent or cure a myriad of our daily aches and pains, not all that glitters is gold. Lemon juice can be hard on teeth enamel. Therefore, it's important to dilute it with water and rinse your mouth thoroughly with filtered water after drinking lemon juice.

"Mike Pence ""gay conversion therapy saved my marriage""","By Fink | Leave/Read Comments Vice President-elect Mike Pence claims that a 1983 conversion therapy saved him. 
Indianapolis, IN — In a surprise announcement today, Indiana Governor and Vice President-elect Mike Pence said that gay conversion therapy saved his marriage. The controversial Republican, who was elected the 50th governor of the Hoosier State, has been a long-time proponent of a “Biblical view” on homosexuality and as a member of Congress stated that the legislative branch “should oppose any effort to recognize homosexuals as a ‘discrete and insular minority’ entitled to the protection of anti-discrimination laws similar to those extended to women and ethnic minorities.” 
“It[gay conversion therapy] was instrumental in helping me overcoming certain urges,” said the Vice President elect in an interview with Fox News. “With God’s help, and the work of many of his therapists, I was able to seek the straight path when I was a younger man. If it wasn’t for that, I would have never been able to marry.” 
Conversion therapy is psychological treatment or spiritual counseling designed to change a person’s sexual orientation from homosexual or bisexual to heterosexual. Such treatments are controversial and are a form of pseudoscience. However many orthodox and fundamentalist Christians believe that it does work, citing numerous examples of success. In more ancient times prior to 1981, conversion therapies in the United States and Western Europe included ice-pick lobotomies, chemical castration and various hormonal treatments. Efforts were largely concentrated on men, as female homosexuality was generally viewed as “hot.” This split along gender lines was due American’s general stupidity. 
Many of Mike Pence’s classmates at Indiana University said the young Pence struggled with “identity issues.” 
“Oh Mike was always a well-groomed sharp dresser,” said University of Chicago Professor James Badwater who was a dorm roommate of Mr. Pence in 1983. “He was private and kept to himself. He had a large collection of Men’s fitness magazines and listened to Wham! continually. He got into the conversion thing the next year, and then immediately married Karen [Mike Pence’s wife] the following year. It’s going to be great to have our first gay Vice President.” 
It’s unclear how this news will impact the Donald Trump administration, if at all, however many GOP insiders maintain that this demonstrates the incoming administration’s commitment to diversity and the “widening” of the party’s platform to be more inclusive of what have traditionally been party outsiders.",1
Bush Admin Just Got Involved In FBI’s Probe Into Clinton’s Emails And It’s Game Changing (IMAGE) – New Century Times,"Share on Facebook 
When you imagine partisan government overreach, it’s hard not to think about the Bush administration, especially when it comes to ignoring the law to accomplish their goals (think “enhanced interrogation”). When they tell the FBI they’ve gone too far, well, the FBI had better listen. 
In an Op-Ed in the New York Times , Richard Painter, George W. Bush’s White House ethics lawyer from 2005 – 2007, wrote about his problems with the FBI’s latest investigation of Hillary Clinton and, most surprisingly, he’s taking legal action to stop it. According to Painter, it’s an abuse of power. 
(I)t would be highly improper, and an abuse of power, for the F.B.I. to conduct such an investigation in the public eye, particularly on the eve of the election. It would be an abuse of power for the director of the F.B.I., absent compelling circumstances, to notify members of Congress from the party opposing the candidate that the candidate or his associates were under investigation. It would be an abuse of power if F.B.I. agents went so far as to obtain a search warrant and raid the candidate’s office tower, hauling out boxes of documents and computers in front of television cameras. 
The F.B.I.’s job is to investigate, not to influence the outcome of an election. 
Beyond that, Painter says it’s against the law, the Hatch Act in particular, to try to influence the outcome of an election. On that basis, Painter is taking action. George W. Bush's ethics lawyer filed a complaint yesterday against the FBI for violations of the Hatch Act. Via NYT: https://t.co/cXbs2xFYxj pic.twitter.com/3FbVRCPTyi 
— Nick Gourevitch (@nickgourevitch) October 30, 2016 
And that is why, on Saturday, I filed a complaint against the F.B.I. with the Office of Special Counsel, which investigates Hatch Act violations, and with the Office of Government Ethics. I have spent much of my career working on government ethics and lawyers’ ethics, including two and a half years as the chief White House ethics lawyer for President George W. Bush, and I never thought that the F.B.I. could be dragged into a political circus surrounding one of its investigations. Until this week. 
The Hatch Act specifically prohibits government officials, with the exception of the President, the Vice President and a handful of others from engaging in political activities. Painter is particularly concerned about the fact that FBI director James Comey has made comments about Hillary Clinton in the past, such as his statement that Clinton’s handling of classified information was “extremely careless.” 
What seems “extremely careless” is the way Comey has handled this investigation. 
On Friday, the director of the F.B.I., James B. Comey, sent to members of Congress a letter updating them on developments in the agency’s investigation of Mrs. Clinton’s emails, an investigation which supposedly was closed months ago. This letter, which was quickly posted on the internet, made highly unusual public statements about an F.B.I. investigation concerning a candidate in the election. The letter was sent in violation of a longstanding Justice Department policy of not discussing specifics about pending investigations with others, including members of Congress. According to some news reports on Saturday, the letter was sent before the F.B.I. had even obtained the search warrant that it needed to look at the newly discovered emails. And it was sent days before the election, at a time when many Americans are already voting. 
Painter notes that Comey’s intent doesn’t matter. He violated the rules simply by taking the actions that could influence the election and frankly, there was no reason for Comey to release those emails, which aren’t even directly tied to Clinton, now. 
He finished his op-ed with a dire warning to Americans: 
This is no trivial matter. We cannot allow F.B.I. or Justice Department officials to unnecessarily publicize pending investigations concerning candidates of either party while an election is underway. That is an abuse of power. Allowing such a precedent to stand will invite more, and even worse, abuses of power in the future. 
Painter isn’t alone in sharing this concern about Comey. Before these latest emails, Politico published an op-ed comparing Comey to the notorious J. Edgar Hoover , who was the first FBI director, who was perhaps best known for using questionable tactics to bring down dissidents. 
Since taking office, Comey has repeatedly injected his views into executive branch deliberations on issues such as sentencing reform and the roots of violence against police officers. He has undermined key presidential priorities such as crafting a coherent federal policy on cybersecurity and encryption. Most recently, he shattered longstanding precedent by publicly offering his own conclusions about the FBI’s investigation into Hillary Clinton’s email. (The FBI did not respond to a request for comment.) 
It would be difficult to argue—in terms of temperament, manner, or motivation—that he is, or ever will be, the next J. Edgar Hoover. But increasing numbers of critics believe he has displayed a worrying disregard for the rules and norms that have constrained all but one of his predecessors, straying with blithe confidence—and with increasing regularity—across the fine line that separates independence from unaccountability. 
If nothing else, this election year has shown us something completely unprecedented and completely undemocratic. It’s not just that Comey is influencing the election, he’s using emails stolen by a foreign government to influence an election. As Donald Trump says, this is “ worse than Watergate ,” just not in the way Trump thinks. ",1

With less than a week to go until the presidential election, Trump is back to his old dirty tricks with veterans. With Medal of Honor recipients seated behind him, Donald Trump tells supporters: ""I'm brave — financially brave."" https://t.co/uWUUhCtQso pic.twitter.com/EDd7F0PLHT 
— ABC News (@ABC) November 4, 2016 
The Republican presidential candidate was listing the Medal of Honor recipients at the rally, when he stopped and said, “Oh, they’re so much more brave than me. I wouldn’t have done what they did.” 
But, that self-deprecation didn’t last long. 
“I’m brave in other ways,” he said at the rally in Selma, a town 45 miles southeast of Raleigh. “I’m brave — I’m financially brave. Big deal, right? These are real brave.” 
Medal of Honor honorees are given their medals for demonstrating extraordinary valor in combat, under fire. By comparison Trump has always led a life of privilege, including the way he avoided being drafted to serve in Vietnam, by citing mysterious “bone spurs” that disqualified him from going into the armed forces. Coincidentally, those debilitating “bone spurs” never showed up on Trump’s official medical records. 
Other instances of Trump insulting the military include his attack on Khizr Khan, the father of a U.S. Army captain who was killed in Iraq. Trump claimed that he had suffered “sacrifices” like the Khans as well, while building luxury apartments and hosting a reality TV show. 
Trump insulted Senator John McCain, who spent years in a Vietnamese POW camp. When he disagreed with McCain, Trump said he liked soldiers “who don’t get captured,” spitting in the face of the hundreds of prisoners of war. 
The nominee also used veterans as human shields while he was feuding with Fox News. Trump claimed he was holding a fundraiser for veterans when he decided to boycott a primary debate co-moderated by Megyn Kelly. But it turned out he never bothered to donate the money he had promised veterans until he was publicly shamed on being a cheapskate by the Washington Post .

Bombshell Report Exposes FBI Agents Trying To Get Trump Elected (TWEETS) – New Century Times,"
According to Reuters: 
“The new emails turned up as FBI investigators were examining electronic devices used by former Democratic Representative Anthony Weiner in connection with an alleged “sexting” scandal. Weiner’s estranged wife, Huma Abedin, is a Clinton confidante.” 
According to two law enforcement sources, there is a group of investigators within the FBI’s New York Field Office – the office that discovered the recent Anthony Weiner emails – that are hostile toward Clinton – and it is believed that this faction is behind the recent media leaks about the ongoing Clinton Foundation investigation. 
One thing is for sure – if Clinton wins the election on Tuesday, the Democratic Party will undoubtedly be launching an investigation into the FBI, and it would be more than ironic if the most memorable scandal of the 2016 election ends up being about the FBI, instead of Clinton’s emails. 
Apparently, Trump supporter Rudy Giuliani – the former mayor of New York City – might have some involvement in it as well: 
It is a clear violation of the law by these FBI agents in an attempt to influence a presidential election. If any Democrats were thinking about staying home on election day, this should really inspire them to do the opposite. 
Clinton needs every vote now, as people are going to ridiculous lengths to make this election work for Trump, who is currently losing in the polls. Clinton is facing more opposition and obstacles than any presidential candidate has ever dealt with, and even those in power are abusing their authority to get her insane opponent into the White House.

"Trump Livid After Beyonce And Jay Z Support Hillary, Explodes With Rage","Share on Facebook 
Republican Donald Trump has never been good at controlling his anger, and the same goes for his insane jealousy. 
Last night, Jay Z and Beyonce shared the stage with Hillary Clinton at a concert in Cleveland, Ohio. The A-list couple showed Clinton a stunning amount of support, followed by a powerful speech by the Democratic candidate herself. It was a monumental moment, and Trump hated every second of it. 
At a rally of his own, Trump couldn’t hide the fact that he was green with envy. Trump said: 
“We’re going to do it, folks. We’re going to do it. Oh boy, are we going to win Pennsylvania big. Look at this. I hear we set a new record for this building. And by the way, I didn’t have to bring J Lo or Jay Z, the only way she gets anybody. I’m here all by myself. I am here all by myself. Just me. No guitar, no piano, no nothing.” 
Trump didn’t even try to hide how sorry he felt for himself, and it was obvious that he was trying really hard not to completely lose it over the fact that no one likes him and almost no celebrities want to be affiliated with him. You can watch Trump give his pathetic, desperate speech below: 
Trump’s bullsh*t campaign is finally coming to an end. He spent the beginning of his campaign promising America that he’d run a star-studded campaign, and he has almost nothing to show for it almost a year later. Not even his own Republican colleagues wanted to appear with him on the campaign trail, forcing Trump to go it alone. 
Of course Trump is jealous and bitter. While Clinton doesn’t need the support of the massive amount of celebrities who have endorsed her, their support is a clear sign that she is doing something right and her campaign is something worth standing by. You can watch Beyonce and Jay Z stand with Clinton below:

Republican Leader Now Proposes Taking Away Seniors’ Healthcare; Blames Obama – New Century Times,"Share on Facebook 
President Obama is just weeks away from leaving office. Our biggest nightmare, backed by a fully Republican Congress, is about to take over. What that means, other than a far more hateful environment throughout the nation, is that a lot of people will lose a lot. Millions will lose healthcare. They don’t care. The national parks could be put on the auction block. They don’t care. Republicans have already started stripping seniors of their healthcare, and don’t let them try to sell you on the benefits of privatization. There aren’t any. 
House Speaker Paul Ryan appeared on Special Report on Fox with Bret Baier. Ryan, now that he has a Republican in the White House, is set to start right away repealing the Affordable Care Act even Medicare. Well, he wants to privatize Medicare. 
“Your solution has always been to put things together, including entitlement reform,” says Baier, using Republican code for privatizing Medicare. Ryan replies, “If you’re going to repeal and replace Obamacare, you have to address those issues as well. … Medicare has got some serious issues because of Obamacare. So those things are part of our plan to replace Obamacare.” 
Ryan tells Baier, “Because of Obamacare, Medicare is going broke.” This is false. In fact, it’s the complete opposite of the truth. The Medicare trust fund has been extended 11 years as a result of the passage of Obamacare, whose cost reforms have helped bring health care inflation to historic lows. It is also untrue that repealing Obamacare requires changing traditional Medicare. But Ryan clearly believes he needs to make this claim in order to sell his plan, or probably even to convince fellow Republicans to support it. 
Source: Reverb Press 
Here’s the video: 
Ryan, as usual, has it completely backwards. The Affordable Care Act is keeping Medicare afloat. Medicare is also solvent until 2028 and it’s an easy fix to keep it solvent beyond that. 
Health reform, along with other factors, has significantly improved Medicare’s financial outlook, boosting revenues and making the program more efficient. The HI trust fund is now projected to remain solvent 11 years longer than before the Affordable Care Act was enacted. And the HI program’s projected 75-year shortfall of 0.73 percent of taxable payroll is much less than the 3.88 percent of payroll that the trustees estimated before health reform. (See Figure 1.) This means that Congress could close the projected funding gap by raising the Medicare payroll tax — now 1.45 percent each for employers and employees — to about 1.8 percent, or by enacting an equivalent mix of program cuts and tax increases.

What privatization would mean to seniors is that instead of direct coverage, they would get subsidies from which seniors would have to buy their own insurance. Now, let’s forget for a moment that the subsidies will probably not be enough to pay for private coverage, which is much, much more expensive, but if the Affordable Care Act is overturned, it will mean that preexisting conditions will be back. It’s a rare senior (or person) who doesn’t have at least one preexisting condition. In other words, privatizing Medicare will be a huge giveaway to insurance companies, but seniors will be screwed.

CNN Host STUNNED By What Paul Ryan Just Said About Post-Election Racist Attacks (VIDEO) – New Century Times,"Share on Facebook 
There’s no doubt about it – the election of Donald Trump to be the next President of the United States has riled up the reality television star’s hateful supporters – hate crimes have dramatically increased across the country. To add to the fear and frustration that many Americans are feeling, the Republican Party doesn’t even have the guts to admit that the divisive rhetoric it has been spewing for decades has contributed to not only Trump’s rise, but the hateful attitudes that helped him get elected. 
This denial and lack of responsibility was on full display on CNN’s State of the Union this morning, when host Jake Tapper interviewed Speaker of the House Paul Ryan. When Tapper cornered Ryan and asked him to speak to the people who are afraid of the violence and hate crimes against minorities and women that have occurred post-election, Ryan said: 
“First of all, I hate it that people feel this way. And second of all, they should not. I think people should be rest assured, America is a pluralistic inclusive country. It is, it has been and it will continue to be. So, I really think people should put their minds at ease.” 
Tapper pressed him, reminding him that this was a serious, nationwide issue. Ryan responded by shocking Tapper and Americans when he denied that the GOP had any role in it, stating that the Trump supporters that were responsible for these awful acts aren’t Republicans. 
“That’s terrible. By the way, that’s not Republicans. We are the party of Lincoln. People who espouse those views, they’re not Republicans. We don’t want them in our party even if they’re thinking about it.” 
For the record, these attackers ARE most certainly conservatives whose main goal is to Make America White Again – there is no getting around this fact. And just when you thought Ryan couldn’t be any more full of sh*t, he said: 
“And I’m confident Donald Trump feels the same way.” 
Is he serious? Ryan and many other prominent Republicans have spent the last several months condemning Trump for his racism and hateful, divisive rhetoric – and even then, they were complete cowards. These GOPers distanced themselves from his actions, but never had enough of a backbone to actually do what was right and vote against him. Their loyalty to their hateful, discriminatory party has always prevented them from doing the right thing, and thanks to them we will now have a racist misogynist leading our country. 
You can watch the interview below: 
For Republican leaders to deny responsibility in what is now happening in our country is repulsive. They created a political climate that allowed Trump to thrive, and they supported a presidential candidate who encouraged the very violence and discrimination that we are now seeing. The GOP will not be forgiven, and they should not be able to pretend they didn’t contribute to this mess.

Trumpâ€™s Proposed Student Loan Program Makes Him Look More Liberal Than Obama; Republicans Fuming,"Share on Facebook 
Republicans in Congress and perhaps across the nation are suffering today from a case of buyers remorse after Trump begins back peddling on several of his campaign promises, before he even takes office. 
Over the last few days, he backed off on his claim that he’ll repeal Obamacare by saying he’d just tweak it. He’s seemed to have changed his mind on prosecuting Hillary Clinton and he’s no longer talking about banning Muslims. While “drain the swamp,” which referred to Washington’s culture of corruption, was one of his later campaign slogans, he’s filling his cabinet posts with Washington insiders and corporate lobbyists. He’s even appearing to change his mind about his signature issue, the wall between the United States and Mexico . 
One piece of Trump’s campaign rhetoric was actually something that would make people’s lives better and it’s something that Republicans are going to hate. His proposal for student loans is radical, in that it’s not a gift to Wall Street and it’s even more liberal than anything President Obama has proposed. In a rally just a month ago, Trump said about student loans: 
“We would cap repayment for an affordable portion of the borrower’s income, 12.5 percent, we’d cap it. That gives you a lot to play with and a lot to do,” Trump said at a rally in Columbus, Ohio, on Thursday. “And if borrowers work hard and make their full payments for 15 years, we’ll let them get on with their lives. They just go ahead and they get on with their lives.” 
“Students should not be asked to pay more on the debt than they can afford,” Trump said. “And the debt should not be an albatross around their necks for the rest of their lives.” 
Source: Washington Post 
Trump’s proposed debt forgiveness program is actually pretty similar to Obama’s . Instead of a 12.5 percent cap, Obama introduced a cap of 10 percent of a graduate’s income. Trump’s program, though, would leave graduates with five fewer years of debt. Trump’s would forgive debt after 15 years while Obama’s would forgive after 10. In that one significant way, Trump’s program is even more liberal than Obama’s and if he carries it out, Congressional Republicans may have no choice but to turn on their party’s President. 
The American Enterprise Institute is a Washington think tank who issues a lot of the marching orders of Republicans. They were the driving force behind the Iraq war and of failed trickle down economics. This is what they have to say about student loan debt forgiveness: 
“They are way off on their numbers,” said Jason Delisle, a resident fellow at the American Enterprise Institute, a conservative think tank. “If you were going to give loan forgiveness in 15 years, you’re going to forgive a lot more debt than you’re going to make up for in the form of the higher payments they’re proposing, by a lot. I don’t even need to run the numbers. It’s so obvious.” 
Really, it’s not obvious. Forgiving student debt would be a big boost to the economy because it would 1.) incentivize people to become more educated and 2.) put more money back into the economy because graduates would be free to buy more. Not that Republicans care about that, though. They prefer that graduates owe their lives to Wall Street banks and in turning his back on that, Trump is violating literally everything his party stands for.",1
Donald Trump Names White Supremacist As Chief Strategist; Alt-Right Rejoices,"Share on Facebook 
Many of us, for some time now, have been calling out the white nationalism brewing in the nation, most specifically from the Donald Trump campaign for president and many, many of his supporters. Well, now Trump has brought that white supremacy directly into the White House with who he has named as his Chief Strategist and Senior Counselor. 
Trump just named Breitbart Executive Chairman Steve Bannon to the role of Chief Strategist and that should horrify all of us. President-elect Trump to name Stephen Bannon of Breitbart his Chief Strategist & Senior Counselor 
— Jake Tapper (@jaketapper) November 13, 2016 NEW YORK, NY – NOVEMBER 09: Republican president-elect Donald Trump’s campaign manager, Kellyanne Conway, and Trump campaign CEO Stephen Bannon (Photo by Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images) 
According to Think Progress : 
“Trump also named Steve Bannon, the executive chairman of Breitbart News, as “chief strategist and senior counselor” to the president. He will be one of Trump’s closest advisers and, one can presume, one of the most powerful people in America.” 
Bannon previously served as the Trump campaign CEO, and apparently, Trump believes he should carry that role into the White House. 
While at Breitbart, Bannon gave white supremacy and the alt-right a voice, embracing it with open arms. According to the Daily Wire : 
“ Andrew Breitbart despised racism. Truly despised it. He used to brag regularly about helping to integrate his fraternity at Tulane University. He insisted that racial stories be treated with special care to avoid even the whiff of racism. With Bannon embracing Trump, all that changed. Now Breitbart has become the alt-right go-to website, with Yiannopoulos pushing white ethno-nationalism as a legitimate response to political correctness, and the comment section turning into a cesspool for white supremacist mememakers.” 
Think Progress reported: 
“Bannon gave a platform to Milo Yiannopoulos, a prominent white nationalist figure who was banned from Twitter for indicting racist abuse and harassment .” 
So now, a man who openly gave white supremacists an open platform to spread vicious hate has now been given one of the most powerful roles in the Trump administration, and in turn, the world. 
You can best be sure the alt-right white supremacists are rejoicing at this choice that gives calling it the White House a whole new meaning. 
We should all be disgusted and terrified. This is absolutely shameful, yet not at all surprising. The fact that this all comes after our first black president is all the more mortifying.

Video Goes Viral Of Chili’s Manager Taking Away Veteran’s Food Because He’s Black (VIDEO) – New Century Times,"Share on Facebook 
While visiting a Chili’s restaurant in Cedar Hills, Texas, U.S. Army Veteran Ernest Walker was approached by the manager and had his military service questioned even though he had his military ID with him. Chili’s offers free meals to Veterans on Veterans Day as a thank you for their service, but what Walker received was anything but. 
Noticing what was happening, Walker took out his phone and began to record everything that was being said to him. At one point, even his food was stripped away from him. There’s really no other way to see this than an act of racism, and Chili’s needs to answer for it. 
Walker wrote on Facebook : 
“I went there to get a Veterans meal and all was good. I had my service dog with me because I am on Dialysis and he monitors my BP. I ordered the waitress was wonderful. It took about 35 mins for meal to come. So when it attived I gave her a Tip as asjed for a take out. She said sure, at that point a old white guy wearing a Trump flag shirt walked buy me on hi way to the bath room. He came back and aked me what unit did i serve in the 24th. I said no the 25th. He said he was in world war 2 in Germany and we did not see people like you over there. They would no allow blacks. I just listened he left then came back to bathroom again and pet my dog. So waitress put foid in container. Then the managers comes and says a somes guest at the restaurant say that your not a real Soldier. I reply what are you serious what guest. The manager Wesly Patrick said can I see military ID. I felt that was reasonable I most people ask for that so I shoed him my ID it checked out. At that point all he should have said was ‘Sir I am sorry Thank you for your service and I would have left. But instead ge says ‘ tbe guest also says that your service dog is not a service dog. Now that’s when igot upset and started Recording so see for yourself what happened.” 
Watch the altercation here: 
Chili’s did respond by saying : 
“We are aware of the situation that happened at our Chili’s Cedar Hills location yesterday. Our goal is to make every guest feel special. Unfortunately, we fell short on a day we strive to honor our Veterans and active military for their service. We have escalated this to the highest levels of our company.” 
Hopefully, all of this will be resolved properly and Walker given the respect that he deserves. 
The fact that some manager of a local Chili’s restaurant felt so bold to question anyone’s service to deny them a meal is just beyond comprehension.

Chris Matthews Sounds Alarm On Trump Presidency In Chilling Warning To Americans (VIDEO) – New Century Times,"Share on Facebook 
One of the biggest reasons Donald Trump was able to win enough votes to take over the White House was his relentless attacks of corruption against Hillary Clinton, all while the media virtually ignored the accusations of corruption against Donald Trump. In fact, it’s looking more and more likely that by his very first day in office, Donald Trump will be the most corrupt president ever. 
MSNBC’s Chris Matthews and MSNBC’s Chief Legal Analyst, Ari Melber are among several who are beginning to wake up to the reality that Trump plans on using the presidency in the very worst way possible, in a way that would have the Founding Fathers rolling in their graves. Our first self-described billionaire President Elect plans on using the presidency to make himself and his family even more wealthy. 
One of the biggest problems, as Matthew sees it, is that Trump wants to give his children national security clearance and everything that goes along with it, all while letting them take the reigns of the Trump fortune. This is illegal in so many ways. 
As Melber points out, hiring family was banned in an anti-nepotism law passed in 1967. Proponents of the law were especially concerned because a President should be free to fire staff and cabinet members, but that can be tough to do if staff or cabinet members are family. Trump’s workaround for the nepotism law, though, is to not give his family members official titles, but still, he hopes to include them in his decision making processes and let them sit in on critical meetings. 
Here’s the thought and anger provoking video: 
While Matthews’ and Melber’s discussion was mostly theoretical, there are already real-life consequences to Trump’s glaring conflicts of interests. 
The Washington Post on Friday reported that about 100 foreign diplomats are trying to curry favor with the Trump administration by booking rooms in Trump’s Washington DC hotel, sometimes at rates of up to $20,000 a night. If you recall, the Clinton Foundation was accused of offering access in exchange for donations. The evidence that that ever happened was weak, but still, it was something that Trump didn’t let go of during his entire campaign. The idea that Trump would be hosting diplomats, in his hotel, to profit his company, is way beyond anything Clinton is accused of. 
That’s not even the tip of the iceberg. While he did settle the Trump University fraud case, Trump apparently Underreported: 
Trump owes millions to Deutsche Bank 
which is being fined for $14 billion by DoJ

” target=”_blank”>owes millions to Deutsche Bank, a bank which is being fined by the Department of Justice. Will Trump drop the fines in exchange for Deutsche Bank dropping their claim? Perhaps Trump will uncharacteristically take the high road (doubtful), but no president should have that power to begin with. 
I’m sure as we turn over even more rocks, we’ll find far more conflicts of interest and evidence that Trump only ran for office for personal enrichment. 
There’s a reason elected officials are supposed to put all their assets into blind trusts (and handing them over to their kids is the exact opposite of a blind trust). Governments are not in the business of making money. Trump is. That’s a conflict of interest and it should be deemed unacceptable by all Americans. ",1
Trump THREATENS Press In Closed-Door Meeting; Here Are The Terrifying Things He Said – New Century Times,"
In something that could’ve been scripted by George Orwell, President-elect Donald Trump just has pretty much every major media personality and/or outlet over to Trump Tower for a closed-door meeting. 
The NY Post stated : 
“The hour-long session included top execs from network and cable news channels. Among the attendees were NBC’s Deborah Turness, Lester Holt and Chuck Todd, ABC’s James Goldston, George Stephanopoulos, David Muir and Martha Raddatz, 
Also, CBS’ Norah O’Donnell John Dickerson, Charlie Rose, Christopher Isham and King, Fox News’ Bill Shine, Jack Abernethy, Jay Wallace, Suzanne Scott, MSNBC’s Phil Griffin and CNN’s Jeff Zucker and Erin Burnett.” 
Before the meeting, everyone was speculating as to what was going on. Why is Trump colluding with the media? Is he trying to control the conversation and form some sort of state sponsored media? 
Well, speculate no further. Trump called everyone to his tower to scold them like the Henry the 8th he is very much turning out to be. 
According to one source who confided in the NY Post : 
“It was like a f–ing firing squad…Trump started with [CNN chief] Jeff Zucker and said ‘I hate your network, everyone at CNN is a liar and you should be ashamed.” 
Adding: 
“The meeting was a total disaster. The TV execs and anchors went in there thinking they would be discussing the access they would get to the Trump administration, but instead they got a Trump-style dressing down.” 
It was basically Trump throwing a hissy fit and talking down to everyone in the media to tell them how very awful they are to him. Even though they were pretty soft on him throughout the course of his campaign, often given him an open forum and hours of free airtime to tout his craziness. 
Another source said: 
“The meeting took place in a big board room and there were about 30 or 40 people, including the big news anchors from all the networks.” 
Further: 
“Trump kept saying, ‘We’re in a room of liars, the deceitful dishonest media who got it all wrong.’ He addressed everyone in the room calling the media dishonest, deceitful liars. He called out Jeff Zucker by name and said everyone at CNN was a liar, and CNN was [a] network of liars…Trump didn’t say [NBC reporter] Katy Tur by name, but talked about an NBC female correspondent who got it wrong, then he referred to a horrible network correspondent who cried when Hillary lost who hosted a debate – which was Martha Raddatz who was also in the room.” 
Some of the media did try to get a word in edgewise, but it was pretty much all for naught. Trump was there to scold and not get a lesson from the media in freedom of the press and speech. 
NY Post reported a source saying: 
“[CBS Good Morning co-host Gayle] King did not stand up, but asked some question, ‘How do you propose we the media work with you?’ Chuck Todd asked some pretty pointed questions. David Muir asked ‘How are you going to cope living in DC while your family is in NYC? It was a horrible meeting.” 
According to Kellyanne Conway, however, it all went really well. Yet, it’s hard to believe a word that comes out of the Trump camp, because they will say only what they want people to hear, and most of the time there’s barely a sliver of the truth involved. 
No word as to who the source is that spoke to the NY Post . 
It’s pretty clear Trump wants to control the narrative of the press, why else would he have so many big news names over to his palace tower? He wanted to scold them and likely tell them how they should be operating, and we should all be very, very mortified that he even had them over in the first place. 
After all, if you control the press, you control what the people hear. If you control what the people hear, you can tell them anything you want, even if it’s not in their best interests. It’s horrifying, to say the least, absolutely Hitler-esque, if we’re going to be honest. 
The press need to be counted on to hold Trump accountable for everything that he says or does, and if they don’t someone needs to hold the press accountable as well. This is a scary time we’re entering into and hopefully the Constitution will not be shredded and honesty with accountability will prevail.

"In A Bizarre Twist, Jill Stein Could Give The Presidency To Hillary – New Century Times","Share on Facebook 
On Tuesday, researchers announced that there’s enough evidence of hacking or foul play to ask for an audit of three state’s voting tabulations: Wisconsin, Michigan and Pennsylvania. Donald Trump won those three states by a narrow margin and without them, he would have lost. 
There’s a movement to ask the Justice Department to demand the audits, but they might not have to. Help is coming from a surprising source, the Green Party presidential candidate Jill Stein. She’s calling for a recount in those three states and we can help her get one. 
“After a divisive and painful presidential race,” the Green Party candidate said in a statement, “reported hacks into voter and party databases and individual email accounts are causing many Americans to wonder if our election results are reliable.” It's official: Jill Stein announces plans to file for a recount in PA, MI & WI. From her release: pic.twitter.com/Yh0gcVBPOR 
— Alexandra Jaffe (@ajjaffe) November 23, 2016 
Stein may have a case: 
Last Thursday, the activists held a conference call with Clinton campaign chairman John Podesta and campaign general counsel Marc Elias to make their case, according to a source briefed on the call. The academics presented findings showing that in Wisconsin, Clinton received 7 percent fewer votes in counties that relied on electronic-voting machines compared with counties that used optical scanners and paper ballots. Based on this statistical analysis, Clinton may have been denied as many as 30,000 votes; she lost Wisconsin by 27,000. While it’s important to note the group has not found proof of hacking or manipulation, they are arguing to the campaign that the suspicious pattern merits an independent review — especially in light of the fact that the Obama White House has accused the Russian government of hacking the Democratic National Committee. 
Source: NY Magazine 
The math would still be tight. Michigan’s count still isn’t complete, but it’s likely that their 16 electoral votes would add to Trump’s 290. If those three states were suddenly to suddenly turn blue (Trump won the three states with a combined vote difference of just over 100,000), Trump would have 260 electoral votes and Clinton would have a total of 278 electoral votes. 270 are needed to win. 
Stein wouldn’t end up winning the election, no matter what. It’s hard to imagine what her motive would be, other than transparency and regardless of how you feel about her, that’s laudable. 
What she’s lacking so far is money. She needs to raise $2 million by Friday at 4:00 PM Central Time. So far, she’s raised less than 10 percent of that. 
Doing something like this may have its downsides, although not too far down. The confidence in the Electoral College is already eroding. There’s no reason at all that three midwestern states should prevent the clear popular winner from becoming President. The biggest risk is that disgruntled Trump supporters could lash out, but they are lashing out as winners, so let’s not let that stop us from taking the time to ensure that our democracy stays intact.

Trump’s Thanksgiving Message From Three Years Ago Comes Back To Haunt Him (TWEET) – New Century Times,"Share on Facebook 
If there’s one thing we ask of a president, it’s that they be inclusive of all, and President-elect Trump, in a very bizarre way, kinda sorta, did that three years ago in the most Trumpian way ever. 
While most people have Thanksgiving messages of hope and gratitude, Donald Trump wants everyone to know that he wants their day to be happy. Absolutely everyone. Even the “haters and losers.” 
Here’s Trump’s Thanksgiving Day message he tweeted out three years ago: 
“Happy Thanksgiving to all–even the haters and losers!” via Twitter 
Yes, that’s the future leader of the free world, everyone. A man who will have more power than, well, anyone. 
Trump took to Twitter on Thanksgiving Day in 2013 and wished everyone a “Happy Thanksgiving” even to the “haters and losers” and best yet, the tweet is still in his timeline . So, the future President of the United States seems pretty damn proud of calling those who don’t like him “haters and losers” because he still has it on the record in his Twitter feed. 
It will be interesting to see what he tweets this year. Will it be off the cuff, or well-vetted by his staff. I’m sure we’re all on pins and needles waiting. Or not.

"British reaction to Calais Jungle ‘wise move’, say scholars.","October 26, 2016 
Economists and eminent human rights lawyers alike have this week applauded the British stance on re-settling refugees from the Calais ‘jungle’. Professor Donald Rosarch from the Denver School for Human Rights Law mused ‘We admire the wisdom of western nations with aging populations angrily rejecting cohorts of fit young men and boys, none of whom are likely to be a burden to health services for some thirty or forty years. After their ordeal traveling thousands of miles on foot, sometimes after weeks at sea watching their friends die needlessly, these people somehow retain a remarkable humility and willingness to work. It is a dangerous situation.’ 
Ethel Brantingham from Kettering who eats kippers for breakfast in line with her political beliefs who named her terrier pup ‘Nigel’ reflected the views of the British electorate: ‘We simply cannot tolerate an influx of this sort of attitude, these people have learned nothing about entitlement and the values that made Britain great.

BBC loses circling hippos to National Geographic,"October 26, 2016 
In a further blow to the BBC, the hippos swimming in a circle who appear before the BBC news today confirmed they had signed a deal with the National Geographic channel. 
“I know some will see this as a betrayal,” said Edna, spokeshippo for the group. “But you have to realise, the career of a performing hippo isn’t long, and we have to think of our futures.” 
It’s thought their new role will focus less on synchronised swimming and more on traditional hippo behaviours, such as wallowing in mud and gaping angrily at each other in disputes over mating rights and territory. 
“It’s all a bit vulgar, really,” Edna continued. “We’re the best of friends in real life. But it’s what the public want, so what can you do?” 
Meanwhile Rex, spokesdog for the sheepdogs who run round a circular slalom course before the news, shifted uneasily when asked if he could ever be tempted away from the BBC by people offering him biscuits or telling him he was a good boy. 
“Look, it’s not up to us, is it? The shepherds whistle and point, we just go where we’re told,” he added, before running off after a squirrel. YaBasta",1
Channel 4 announces neverending cycle of Gogglebox spinoffs,"October 26, 2016 
Channel 4 has announced that it has finally come up with a format to rival the success of Gogglebox, the documentary-style reality show it created in 2013 that allows viewers to watch various families as they watch TV. 
“We toyed with various ideas,” said a Channel 4 executive, “including Celebrity Gogglebox. Though obviously, we don’t mean actual celebrities – just people who’ve been in an earlier series of Gogglebox. That counts, right? 
“Then someone suggested I’m a Sentient Life-Form, Get Me Out Of Here, in which we’d watch people realising there’s more to life than watching TV. And someone else suggested we just film ourselves struggling to squeeze ever more mileage out of what was a lame idea to begin with. 
“But we finally settled on Gogglebox’s Little Brother. To be shown immediately after Gogglebox, it will allow viewers to watch the participants of Gogglebox as they watch themselves on Gogglebox. 
“What’s more, we’ll encourage viewers to video themselves as they watch it and email it to us to win a prize. The winner will be whoever’s bonded with their sofa at subatomic level.” Share this story...

Shakespeare to remain authentically boring,"October 26, 2016 
The Board of Shakespeare’s Globe have reassured audiences of their mission to produce shows of ‘mind-numbing tweeness’, purposely designed to send your average GCSE Literature student into a spiral of self-harm. Renewing their commitment to Shakespearean traditions, all staff will be expected to adhere to a life expectancy of 40, rats as pets, and a blanket ban on all actors who menstruate. 
Having sacked artistic director Emma Rice for being more modern than ‘an iPhone9 in a holographic dress’, the Board will be looking for someone more in keeping with the Renaissance Period – like an Apothecary with typhoid. Any candidate must come with a ruff, a small goatee and a pathological distrust of the Spanish navy. 
One scholar explained: ‘The fear is, that by making Shakespeare contemporary and relevant, you might actually make Shakespeare contemporary and relevant. And the last thing we want are ordinary people comprehending theatre or even, God forbid, enjoying it. Just look what happened to the beast with two backs, once the plebs discovered ‘The Joy of Sex’. 
Mrs Rice had come under considerable criticism for using lighting and sound in ‘The Globe’, while removing popular features – such as the bear-baiting pit and the ‘Potato Museum of Wonder’. Upon hearing that she planned to replace lute players with Spotify, one board member demanded: ‘Burn her, she’s a witch!’ Share this story...

Labour leadership not covered by 30-day refund,"October 27, 2016 
Despite the right to a refund becoming law, many Corbyn supporters have been disheartened to discover that they will have to stick with their original purchase; at least until the next General Election. What for many was an impulse buy, has turned out to be rather thread-bare, reminiscent of the 70s and lacking the ‘nuclear deterrent option’ that other models come with. 
While most customers will be able to take their complaints to a certified Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR), voters will have to keep their faulty goods or ‘Nick Clegg promise’ as it is sometimes called. This also effect areas outside of politics, with consumers are warned that providing shelter for a migrant will not be covered by Syrian returns-policy. 
A spokesman for Marks & Spencer’s customer support said: ‘Usually after Christmas we see an influx of unwanted, ill-fitting underwear. But our lingerie department is unable to offer store credit for a soiled socialist policy. All we can give consumers looking to return a worn John McDonnell MP, is a part-exchange for a new Tom Watson and pair of slipper socks’. 
One Volkswagen dealership which had previously been inundated with diesel cars, reported to having a rusted John ‘two-jags’ Prescott abandoned on their forecourt. An ADR administrator clarified: ‘Politicians can only be returned if they are of a less than satisfactory quality, unfit for purpose or where the voter was of unsound mind….so…um…sorry, yes, actually that pretty much covers all politicians’.   27th, 2016 by Wrenfoe   Wrenfoe  ",1

"‘Bake shaming’ now a hate crime, say police","October 27, 2016 
Incidents of “bake shaming” have increased by 600% since Wednesday evening’s Bake Off final, say police. 
Bake shaming, legally classified as abuse aimed at “those who haven’t seen, or don’t really care about, The Great British Bake Off” has become more of a problem since the announcement that the programme will be crossing channels next year. 
One victim, Kevin Dunsford, who has lived his whole life in this country was “bake shamed” at his local bus stop. He told our reporter: I was standing with my wife and we were talking about the weather and a woman walked up, looked at us in disbelief and said, “Why aren’t you talking about Bake Off?” She then started ranting on about British Values and called us an “unwelcome minority”. 
Home Secretary, Amber Rudd, said she was appalled by this situation and condemned these acts as “despicable”. She added, “Our cake crime laws are among the best in the world.” Share this story...

Tradesman keeps promise,"October 27, 2016 
Ivy Pollard, 73, from the backend of Brighton was all set for a binge-watching session of her favourite TV series when the tradesman who said he would arrive between 7am and Midday arrived between 7am and Midday. 
‘I’d just finished skinning up the first spliff of the day when the miracle took place’ she said. ‘There was this unexpected knock at the door which I was hoping would be the new clown costume and accessories that I ordered 3 weeks ago!’ 
‘But it wasn’t! It was the guy from Swirlpool! The one thing I wasn’t expecting! Someone actually doing what they said they were going to do! The only time I experience that level of follow-through is on the toilet, or in my pull-ups, but even that doesn’t happen all that often.’ 
‘It was all a bit embarrassing actually, because there wasn’t anything wrong with the oven yet. The warranty had just expired so I knew it was only a matter of time. I thought I was being clever by booking an engineer straight away, confident that by the time he turned up, there would be something wrong with it.’ 
‘Mind you, he didn’t mind. It turns out he’s a big Game of Thrones fan as well. So we had a smoke and cracked on with the show. We had a jolly old day in the end, much to the chagrin of the other customers he was scheduled to see that day, but, then again, that’s tradesmen for you.’ Jodster",1
Toby Young ‘far fetched’ say benefit claimants,"October 28, 2016 
A row has broken out over a review of Ken Loach’s new film, “I, Daniel Blake” with several benefit claimants refusing to believe that its author, Toby Young, could possibly have happened. Young’s review in The Mail, in which he described Loach’s representation of common DWP practices such as delaying appeals and giving out benefit sanctions for minor errors as “far fetched”, was met with anger and incredulity in online forums. However, many of the claimants who were involved in researching the film have simply denied that Young was even real. 
Said Sarah, 41, who claims ESA for chronic Parkinson’s and has been forced to make several appeals, “Toby Young simply doesn’t ring true. We’re meant to believe that he’s a journalist, but he’s more of a lefty’s version of what a Daily Mail reviewer ought to be like. Where is the research, the information? I can’t really believe that journalism’s that bad, it just isn’t credible.” Jack, 47, who has been sanctioned twice on JSA, was more forthright: “This is a fraud. Everyone knows that it’s easy to impersonate a journalist and the idea that this so-called “Toby Young”, if that is what he’s really called, bears any resemblance to how things are on the ground is simply ludicrous”. 
The Daily Mail have hit back, saying Toby Young was “the genuine article” and that “if we didn’t give an outlet to marginalised Oxbridge graduates with appalling senses of entitlement, then there was a real danger that their voices might be drowned out by the cries of the needy and the vulnerable”. Mental health campaigners have also responded angrily, saying that Young was “clearly delusional”, needing “help rather than disbelief”. The DWP have refused to get involved in the row and, when asked to comment, a spokesman merely spat on the ground and gave me a piecing stare. andyiong",1
Everyone now officially an artisan,"October 28, 2016 
Following the revelation that printers, blacksmiths, cigar pen makers and even quilt rack makers have joined bakers, butchers and cheese makers in using the term ‘artisan’, experts have ruled that absolutely anyone is free to claim to be one. The only conditions are that they have to be unemployed marketing graduates and are not funneling over a thousand tonnes a day of cement powder and cows’ vaginas into a mixer and hoping for the best. 
‘Artisan is a coffee-focused, fun-loving space that flirts with pushing design boundaries,’ said Jason McKillop, owner of the Artisan Café in Stamford Brook. ‘Our Baristas treat each cup like a fine chef does a meal, taking pride and time to ensure each coffee is flawless. We continuously adjust the grind to allow for changes in the atmosphere – yeah, yeah, all right, it’s a café but we need a reason to charge £4 for a cup of coffee, don’t we?’ 
The trend has been welcomed by easily impressed simpletons with unaccountably well-paid jobs. ‘I like to know that “Fire is at the literal heart of Artisan; handmade, rustic dishes served straight from the flames”,’ said Manchester-based bell end Thomas Lee-Enderby of his favourite new restaurant. ‘That means they are preparing and cooking the food, right? I also like the bar which “serves handcrafted cocktails alongside cherry picked beers, wines and spirits” because I can’t stand cocktails made by robots.’ 
Meanwhile, after learning that a nearby artisan chocolatier ‘metamorphoses the finest cocoa in a myriad of chocolate shapes and flavours to surprise and satisfy all cravings and occasions’, while an artisan supplier of flush-mount wedding albums has made them ‘insanely affordable for everyone and every day’, Keith Rogers from Leamington Spa has copied and pasted from some websites and declared himself to be Britain’s first artisan supplier of spare parts and accessories for photocopiers. 
‘I use parts sourced from lovingly crafted polypropylene of an unmatched quality adhering to a real artisan standard,’ Rogers said. ‘By selecting only the finest toners, dyed to a rich black hue using locally sourced carbon black from South Wales, I am delivering a copier more complex in taste and variety for a more satisfying customer experience. Will that do? Now you can resume photocopying your own arses on it.’ Oxbridge (HT Spartacus)",1
Northamptonshire named Britain’s first Area of Outstanding General Mediocrity,"October 29, 2016 
It was the award a few wanted but only one could have. In the end, it was disappointment for Buckinghamshire, the borough of Chorley and everywhere within a five-mile radius of Motherwell as Northamptonshire won the nomination as the UK’s first Area of Outstanding General Mediocrity (AOGM). 
‘Neither quite vile enough for it to be funny, nor possessed of anything that might induce visitors to stay longer than it takes to use a toilet, this most nondescript of counties was a natural choice,’ said Lord Melvyn Bragg, chairman of the judging panel. ‘Its highest point is a mundane 738 feet. Its county flower is the cowslip. Even when Corby ceased to be the largest town in Britain without a railway station in 2009, Irthlingborough succeeded to the title. I could go on, but, you know, life’s too short, isn’t it?’ 
Classification as an AOGM enables a region to apply for EU grants in order to preserve itself from the commercial pressures that might otherwise make it slightly less shit. Many local luminaries had feared that Northampton Saints’ victory in last year’s Rugby Premiership, coupled with Princess Diana being buried there, might draw in the odd few hundred visitors, some of whom might even have settled and complicated the local gene pool. Now, those fears have been allayed. 
‘Northamptonshire is synonymous with shoe-making, except fortunately the last factory closed down in the 1980s, otherwise we might have had to open a museum about it,’ said John Caswell, Mayor of Northampton. ‘Now we just make Weetabix and being the largest settlement anywhere in Britain without a unitary authority is the most interesting fact I can think of about this God-forsaken hellhole. And if you think we’re crap, try hanging out in Kettering for an evening. Fucking hell.’ 
The county’s seven metropolitan authorities are now thinking about meeting some time before the end of the year to discuss how to spend the £20,000 grant. Corby, a former steeltown that attracted thousands of Scottish migrants but which is now ranked Britain’s ninth worst place to live, wants to use it to bribe Alex Salmond into annexing it, while Northampton itself wants to put a blue plaque on the site of the first car chase involving the police in 1899 and Wellingborough will only turn up if the meeting doesn’t clash with Corrie.

Man wildly optimistic ahead of flat pack assembly,"October 29, 2016 
A man with no DIY experience has set aside around 15 minutes to assemble a 300 piece cabin bed this weekend. 
Having glanced through the 36-page instruction booklet, 40-year-old Nick Ferguson plans to start the job at around 6pm on Saturday and will definitely be done by quarter past if not slightly before. 
‘I’ll simultaneously be making a vegetarian chilli,’ he said. ‘And I’m going to complete both tasks in a cool and fun way that involves my three young children.’ 
Meanwhile Mrs Ferguson was hastily making plans to take the kids to her mothers. 
‘DIY with Nick is what you might call a journey,’ she said.

Why shaving means freedom to Omar,"October 29, 2016 
To most men, it is a simple daily routine that they barely think of. Spraying fresh white foam over their face and taking it off with a 28-blade razor – how utterly ordinary. 
But for Omar, an intelligent, fit, and attractive 22-year-old young man, shaving off his beard is a remarkable act of freedom. Because Omar has been living under one of the most oppressive regimes the world has ever seen. At last, that regime is on the verge of being broken and Hoxton will soon be free of the Hipster State. 
As the forces of reason, justice and sanity close in on Hoxton, Dalston and trendy Whitechapel, Omar is one of the first young people to benefit. 
“It has been hell,” he said. “The hipsters began moving in during the 80s on a wave of Acid Jazz and beer with lemons in the neck of the bottle. Of course, I was not even born then. But by the time I was, Hoxton was drowning in hipsters with their artisan small furniture manufacturers, silk-screened candle warehouses and eventually, internet start-ups.” 
Omar was terrified of the fashion police, who beat up one of his friends for wearing the wrong shade of burgundy retro Farahs. So like everyone else in the area, he grew a beard. Omar was only nine at the time: he has suffered 13 years of facial hair, Adidas Stan Smith trainers and feigning an interest in stunt kites. “It has been hell,” he said. 
But the first signs of liberation arrived with a girl bravely walking through the streets without a tattoo. She was dragged away and quickly inked with an image of the logo from Moog synthesisers. But soon more followed her, bravely flaunting their unadorned skins. Known as “cleans”, they were at the vanguard of the forces of sanity. Then Greggs opened a branch in Hoxton High Street and more normal people arrived to eat its hand-finished non-craft pies. The final straw was a pub which didn’t have a trendy name and did not brew its own beer. Faced with the uncowered march of normality, hipsterism began to capitulate. 
While there is still a bearded rump of diehards, they are being rounded up and shot or made to become drones at Amazon’s HQ, and trendy East London is on the way to becoming an ordinary part of the world once more. Immacagain",1
Tories to stop Santa migration by Christmas,"October 30, 2016 
David Cameron has announced plans to curb the flood of European migrant workers, specifically mythological 4th-century Greek bishops, from invading our homes. The Prime Minister has promised to apply an ‘emergency brake’ on rotund present-givers who have been sneaking across our borders with the aid of a magical flying sleigh and a blithe disregard for passport control. 
A Home Office spokeswoman said: ‘We need to beware of Greeks bearing gifts – or pretty much anyone from Eastern Europe – smelling of mince pies. We can’t just have quasi-mystical figures coming over here, parking their clapped-out reindeer wherever they want, stealing our low-wage jobs – jobs which could easily be filled by a British Druid or Boggart – and blackmailing hard-working British families into plying them with sherry.’ 
Some children have expressed their disappointment that the festive season will be minus one pivotal figure. Yet Mr Cameron has committed to an in/out referendum, in 2017, over whether stockings will be filled. Tory backbencher Bernard Jenkin has suggested Parliament pass a law introducing a cap on beards, rosy cheeks and Polish tooth fairies, while a tweeted offer from former minister Brooks Newmark to ‘fill your stockings any time you like, sweetie pie’ was hastily withdrawn, as indeed was Mr Newmark himself. 
Outgoing European Commission head, Jose Manuel Barroso, has warned of the ‘historic mistake’ the UK would make if it outlawed Father Christmas. ‘The UK signed up to the laws of the EU, which specifically permit the free movement of labour,’ he said. ‘Any traffic infringements Santa may commit are a matter for the international air traffic control authorities.’ 
However Nigel Farage countered: ‘Santa has long be associated with increased crime, elf trafficking and prostitutes – or ‘ho ho ho’s’, as he calls them. Arbitrarily deciding who is naughty or nice is just the sort of thing a European bureaucrat would support. And it’s typical of those Eastern Europeans that he only works seasonally, then swans off back to Lappland, wherever that is, leaving us to clear up the mess. We propose to simply keep white Christmas white, you know what I mean’.   30th, 2016 by Wrenfoe   Wrenfoe  ",1
Hillary Clinton strangles Bald Eagle,"October 30, 2016 
In what is being described as another ‘bizarre’ attempt to sabotage her own campaign, Hillary Clinton has desecrated a series of beloved US symbols, including punching a bison, setting fire to the Stars & Stripes and spitting at Jerry Seinfield. The Presidential hopeful seems determined to make a series of unprovoked errors, not least of which was agreeing to Bill hosting a sleepover for a group of Girl Guides. 
Short of dressing the Statue of Liberty in a Burka, Mrs Clinton has lurched from one PR blunder to another. Commented one journalist: ‘The Presidential race is entering the final furlong and if Mrs Clinton was horse – and before you can say Benghazi – she’s gone from bookie’s favourite to an ingredient at the local glue factory’. 
Having already become the unwitting focus of various health scares and FBI investigations, Mrs Clinton’s campaign is as orderly as a Marx Brothers movie. 
Her lead in the polls has been cut as video emerges of her lighting a cigar with a rolled up Bill of Rights, then proceeding to take a dump on the White House lawn. 
Hillary’s erratic behaviour has seen her sing the Star-Spangled Banner in Korean, dress as Oprah Winfrey for Halloween and pebble-dash Mount Rushmore. Remarked a flummoxed advisor: ‘She keeps doing the unthinkable – like making Donald Trump electable’. Share this story...",1

Gove criticised for leaving Boris unattended,"October 31, 2016 
Parent groups and petting zoos have been outraged by reports that the ex-Education Secretary may have abandoned Boris Johnson to his own devices in the Foreign Office. Having already acquired a reputation for leaving children unattended, Mr. Gove has shown gross negligence by allowing a Boris to play with flammable items such as matches, Brexit negotiations and the nuclear launch codes. 
Alexander Boris de Pfeffel Johnson, age 52 ¾, is best described as ‘an awkward child’ and whose clumsy antics on zip wires and with women not his wife, are well-documented. Staff at the Foreign Office attest to seeing Mr. Johnson wandering around in his pyjamas and in a confused state, asking: ‘What’s Article 50? Where’s Nanny? And who’s up for some rumpy pumpy?’ 
While the law does allow for a man-child of Boris’ age to be left unattended, the Animals Act 1971 makes Mr. Gove ‘strictly liable’ for any damage caused. An NSPCC spokesman said: ‘You wouldn’t leave a dog unattended for an extended period of time and the same applies to Boris. A dog would quickly get destressed, start defecating and gnawing at his own balls…and the same applies to Boris’. 
NSPCC guidelines suggest that someone unable to find a hair brush in the morning, would struggle in an emergency or with interacting someone ‘a bit ethnic’. In the meantime Mr. Johnson is being sheltered in Battersea Dogs Home until he can be properly house-trained; staff commented: ‘Boris isn’t just for Xmas or the referendum – he’s going to chewing up the furniture and UK trade agreements for years to come’.   31st, 2016 by Wrenfoe   Wrenfoe   Politics",1

Generic acoustic pop song triggers world peace,"November 1, 2016 
Political commentators the world over have been amazed to see that an indie ballad by aspiring singer songwriter James Berk, performed last night at an open mic night in Hertford, has gone some way to creating a world free from war and negativity. 
Minutes after Berk sang the opening line (‘no war, let’s have peace, let’s have peace in the west and the east’), Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump reportedly ate a vegan lasagne and drew a watercolour drawing of a rainbow together, then decided to abandon their futile sparring and hand the presidency over to Greenpeace. 
As Berk moved on to the bridge, (a whispered repetition of ‘fuck the Tories, fuck the Tories’ over a grittily strummed G chord), Theresa May issued a statement that she and her party had been wrong over a lot of things, and were immediately going to halt arms sales to Saudi Arabia and Israel, as well as scrapping trident. 
Bashed Al-Assad joined in minutes later, going on to the streets of Aleppo to hand out cornettos. 
Julian Smith, who puts on the night, said ‘it’s great to see that there’s a whole host of emerging talent in Hertford, everything from acoustic acts like James, to spoken word poets, to great rock bands like ‘Jenny and The Farmer’s Sons’. I think the world peace that James has created proves that the night is well worth the £5 entry fee.’",1
"Millions of Romanians, Bulgarians preparing to ‘avoid UK like the plague’","November 2, 2016 
Fears of a huge influx of immigrants from Romania and Bulgaria have given way to indignation after a poll showed workers from the two countries are preparing to ‘avoid Britain like the plague’, when movement restrictions are eased later this year. 
A new survey of over 2,000 people in both countries revealed that, rather than preparing to flood into the UK and take all the jobs recently vacated by returning Poles, Romanians and Bulgarians are actually surprisingly well acquainted with how crap everything is and will most probably steer clear. 
‘There was a time last summer when it looked quite fun in Britain,’ said Liana Domescu, a 25-year-old unemployed graduate from Timisoara. ‘You know, with the Jubilee and the Olympics and Kate Middleton and stuff. But since then it’s all been back to the Britain we know and hate – sex abuse, measles outbreaks, HMV going under, your failing post-war-era Health Service, David Cameron, how do you people cope?’ 
The news came as a surprise to analysts, who had predicted that up to 25,000 Romanian and Bulgarian jobseekers would arrive at Heathrow each day. BAA Ltd, the owners of Heathrow, had already warned that this would be ‘roughly 24,990 more than we can cope with per day’ and even hinted that queues could develop in the arrivals lounge. 
UKIP leader Nigel Farage was ‘incensed’ by the news. ‘It’s a shocking insult to the people of Britain,’ said Farage. ‘We’ve been preparing a well-honed tirade of crackpot dogma, frosty glares and grumbling about the strain on public services to welcome these people to this country, only to find they’re only interested in coming if there are jobs! That’s the problem with foreign freeloaders, they just aren’t willing to put the work in. What am I going to do with this ‘Boris Out’ placard now? I can’t possibly use it for any other political purpose.’ 
For Domescu, the final straw came during the funeral of Margaret Thatcher last week. ‘I was still thinking of coming to Britain, but then they broadcast those pictures of your Chancellor Osborne openly weeping on national television and it finally hit home how bad things must be for that to happen,’ she said. ‘So I’ll just stay here after all – the weather’s far nicer and I hear there’s a job going at the local horse abattoir.’ Share this story...",1
Turkeys face deep divisions over Thanksgiving vote,"November 2, 2016 
A group of about 200,000 White Holland turkeys in a gigantic shed at a farm in Ohio is now debating whether or not to vote in favour of Thanksgiving. The vote to be made next week by pecking once at a pile of grain for ‘Thanksgiving’ or twice for ‘Something Else’ comes after bitter arguments in which claims and counter-claims were made about the availability of dust for bathing in over the turkeys’ long-term (i.e. three-week) future. 
Many turkeys have deplored the resulting divisions, which have seen elevated levels of pecking in the once harmonious community five miles from Wapakoneta. ‘I’ve lived here all my life, y’all,’ said turkey hen Wanda-Mae Cabrera. ‘What was it we were deciding on again? Me an’ my folks before me, we all lived here, yes we did.’ 
Voting for Thanksgiving means that the turkeys will be able to build a wall from their own faeces to deter any incoming poultry from Kentucky from trying to get into the shed, once they have mastered the intricacies of building a wall from their own faeces. Many also believe that this will make the shed great again, as it hasn’t been great for a long time but definitely used to be. They also said they liked the sound of a new farmer called Donald, who recently grabbed a pussy-cat that raided the shed before it could do any damage. 
Some turkeys prefer to carry on not celebrating Thanksgiving because the past 244 generations had not and had all gone away to live happily on a farm somewhere else, apparently. ‘One labourer said we will get a right stuffing either way,’ said anti-Thanksgiving turkey DeMarius Jackson, aged 28 weeks. ‘Well, that’s democracy. I imagine.’ 
‘I ain’t having no goddam American Bronzes sharing my shed, no sirree,’ raged White Holland cock Burl Griffin CCXXVI. ‘Before you know it, they’ll be gobblin’ around your hens, stealin’ your water and sayin’ you can’t worship the Great Spotlight in the Roof no more. I ain’t breedist but have you seen the size of their wattles? I like my shed the way I like it, so I’m for Thanksgiving, sure thing. What is Thanksgiving, anyway?’ Share this story...

Palace continuing to let Prince Philip think ‘Miss Markle’ is Agatha Christie character,"November 3, 2016 
I can’t understand why everyone’s getting interested in these old murder mysteries again,’ a baffled Prince Philip is understood to have said to aides at Buckingham Palace. ‘Aren’t they all a bit old hat? Or in Mrs Philip’s case, old crown? All I’ve heard is Miss Markle this, Miss Markle that, and quite a lot of Miss Markle the other,’ he told one footman, sending him out for some hearing aid batteries and a Twix. It’s understood Buckingham Palace insiders have been warned not to explain the true identity of ‘Miss Markle’ to the Duke of Edinburgh. 
‘Why Prince Harry is suddenly interested in whodunnits – well it beats me. Didn’t we have that Belgian detective to dinner once? You know, the one that wrote ‘Ten Little… Ten little… bugger me it’s gone. Anyway, there was ten of the little blighters, whatever they were, and then there were none. Ten Green Bottles? No, that’s not it.’

Man in Charles Tyrwhitt store “only wanted to hear it said it out loud”,"November 3, 2016 
A man who spent an entire afternoon browsing ‘half-heartedly’ at the shirts in Charles Tyrwhitt’s flagship store in London’s Jermyn Street has admitted he was only there to hear someone say the name ‘Tyrwhitt’ out loud. 
“We get all these leaflets and inserts from Charles whatsisface through the post and I’m tired of saying to the wife ‘just some more rubbish from Charles thingummy, dear’, and her saying ‘who?’ and me going ‘Trywhite, tirrywitt, trrrHitt, tyreRwhite’, and her getting worried about me.” 
“So I decided to find out how you said the name of the person whose leaflets account for most of the stuff in our recycling bin. Unfortunately, not a single customer came in so I was unable to witness any conversations about this twirrit shirt or that tirriwrit tie. I thought my luck was in when the assistant mistook me for someone genuinely interested in the range of middlemanagerwear on display, but when he said it was one of Charles Wossname’s biggest sellers, he sort of mumbled the wossname bit.”   Bravenewmalden   Bravenewmalden   News In Brief 0",1
"Article 50 appeal to be heard by Mary Berry, Mel and Sue","November 4, 2016 
The government has caused further controversy this morning by announcing that its appeal against the High Court’s ruling on Article 50 will not be heard by the Supreme Court but by Mary Berry, Mel and Sue, the former stars of The Great British Bake Off. 
The news comes after polling showed that 52% of voters were sick of so-called ‘experts’ being asked to make decisions about the governance of the United Kingdom. A government source said: ‘The ex-Bake Off team were definitely our first choice to make a call on Article 50. They are far more likely to reach a decision that meets with public approval than those boring old farts in the Supreme Court. I mean, what have they got? OK, 265 years’ worth of legal experience between them and significant expertise in relevant fields of constitutional precedent and interpreting centuries of law. But you know, Mary Berry! Mel and Sue! Soggy bottoms! Ha ha! What do you mean, “is that really sufficient”? You’re obviously some kind of rabid anti-democratic elitist.’ 
Berry admitted to being ‘surprised’ but willing to rise to the challenge proposed by the government. ‘Up to now my experience hasn’t really included very much British constitutional law or international jurisprudence,’ she said. ‘But I do know when something is half-baked, impossible to prove, likely to crumble into a mess, or just leaves an absolutely disgusting taste in the mouth. So perhaps I will be able to understand the government’s Brexit strategy after all.’ 
‘There are all sorts of reasons why this is an absolute blinder of an idea,’ said prime minister Theresa May in a Commons statement. ‘It’s great for the employment figures as it keeps these three women in work when they’d otherwise be on the scrap heap. They’re significantly more popular with the public than those fusty old bastards who found against us last week. Although I understand Sue is openly gay, so we’ll have to make sure nobody tells the Mail. She doesn’t fence, does she? 
‘Mind you, “Giedroyc”…what’s that, Polish? Somebody get Amber Rudd on the phone, quick.’ Share this story...

Guy Fawkes effigy industry collapses,"November 6, 2016 
Just days away from what was traditionally its busiest day of the year, the Guy Fawkes effigy industry has finally collapsed after years of steady decline. All remaining effigy production stations on street corners have closed with immediate effect, with hundreds of 10 year-old street urchins laid off. 
Despite attempts at buy-outs by foreign effigy firms, it is thought the collapse was due to an unrealistic pricing structure, which completely failed to take account of inflation. 
Economist James Hampton told us: “I’ve looked through the figures and I have to agree that the fault clearly lies at the pricing level. Frankly, a ‘penny for the Guy’ barely covers the raw materials of the effigy. By the time you’ve factored in the wooden trolley, you’re actually making a loss.” 
“The tragic thing is that there is still a market need for life-size cloth dolls of Catholic terrorists from the 16th Century. However, taking account of production and marketing costs, a more realistic proposition would have been about £12.30 for the Guy, or in euros, €12.30.” 
The collapse comes at a time when foreign effigy manufactures have been taking increasing orders for effigies of presidents, prime ministers, book authors and cartoonists, while Apple has recently launched the iGuy, and self-combusting re-usable electronic effigy which can be connected to the iCloud to mutter heresy as it is consumed by the flames. 
The effigy workforce are today looking for work in industries with similar skill sets, such as working in Build-a-Bear Workshops, sewing together giant bean bags and producing dummies used for bayonet practice. Meanwhile, thousands of unbought Guy Fawkes’ now make up an ‘effigy mountain’ in the midlands, and are likely to remain there until someone can think of a way of destroying them. Share this story...

May puts nation on high-poppy alert,"November 6, 2016 
Distracted by suffering refugees, confused by convoluted Brexit negotiations or just plain scared by a Trump presidency? No? Neither is your Prime Minster. Today Theresa May did what every true leader does in a crisis – which is to turn everyone’s attention to meaningless ephemera; like poppies, Grammar Schools and who should present the new ‘Bake-off’? 
Taking a break from quashing the Orgreave Inquiry, Mrs May said FIFA’s stance of not politicizing sport was ‘outrageous’. A spokeswoman explained: ‘In these times of austerity, we need cheap, meaningless gestures accompanied by hollow outrage. If over-paid under-achieving footballers are not allowed to wear a poppy – then the terrorists have won. It’s a known fact that Afghan jihadists fear the poppy…although admittedly 80% of their income is based on the opium trade…um…er…I may not have thought this through…’ 
Armed police are expected to patrol our streets, opening fire on anyone not wearing a poppy or failing to whistle the tune from ‘The Dambusters’. A Police Inspector remarked: ‘We may be perpetuating a mawkishly sentimental view of war but don’t think for a second you can get away with recycling last year’s poppy – we’re wise to that dodge!’ 
Without a doubt this is the most important issue of 2016 – whether 22 footballers can wear poppies for 90 minutes in a stadium filled with 60,000 people wearing poppies. Some cynics have suggested Theresa May’s use of misdirection in these troubled times, is the political equivalent of David Copperfield pulling an elephant out his arse. Her spokeswoman countered: ‘The important thing is to remember those who sacrificed their lives in war– rather than the reasons behind it or making sure it never happens again’. Share this story...

Experts tired of the general public,"November 7, 2016 
Experts around the country, from rocket scientists to brain surgeons, have confessed that they’re tired of the British public. 
‘If we’re not careful, we’re in serious danger of having no experts at all.’ says the nations favourite expert on absolutely everything, Professor Brian Cox. ‘I refuse to believe that’s what Joe Public really wants, but it’s what they’re in danger of getting. 

Professor Jane Wilson, clinical neuroscientist at Greater London Hospital agrees. ‘Patients routinely ask me about diseases they looked up on the internet and think they have, just because they got a headache last Tuesday. I never use Google to look up symptoms, but I can’t tell you how many times I’ve searched “how to become a plumber” and considered passing on my ‘expert badge’ to Barbara from Ealing – she clearly feels she’s earned it.’ 
The Centre for Rocket Scientists took it one step further, and released a statement that accused the public of being ‘children with the delusion of competence about issues they haven’t the slightest clue about’, and challenged any person on the street ‘to put a rocket millions of miles into space before crashing it on Mars’.

Man imprisoned for failing to provide an Amazon review,"November 7, 2016 
‘We must have sent him four emails asking for a review, but he just ignored them,’ said an Amazon spokesman today. ‘He hadn’t marked the product as a gift, so there was no reason to not provide a review,’ he added. 
Judge Roberts commented when sentencing Billy Askew (24) from Winsford to three months in gaol that: ‘it was every on-line shopper’s civic duty to provide a review, even if it’s clearly horseshit’. Billy was clearly shaken by the sentence: ‘it was just a set of toe-nail clippers,’ he pointed out as he was escorted from the dock. ‘They cut my toe-nails, what more is there to say?’ he asked, narrowly avoiding having his fingers trapped in the cell door. 
The Amazon spokesman defended referring Billy to the authorities: ‘Everybody provides reviews these days, even HMRC gave our tax return a review. One star, a bit harsh,’ he added, while confirming that if Billy had been an Amazon Prime member. ‘We’d probably have written the review for him’. 
Billy has clearly seen the error of his ways, as he posted a review of his cell on TripAdvisor. ‘Smaller than advertised, has an all pervading smell of wee and can you believe it – no spare keys!’ Share this story...

America votes to make itself grate again,"November 7, 2016 
Today the world awaits the results of a record-breaking American vote against the worst Not President of the United States (NPOTUS) in history, instead electing by default someone it is already ashamed of. In the past twenty-four hours, the two front-runners have finally ceased in their last-ditch attempts to sway swing voters to detest them less than the other contemptible candidate. 
The UK has recently emerged from a similar vote on the basis of limited information on two outcomes where the consequences were indeterminate and the candidates literally lied for Britain. Most voters voted for the thing they least understood because the consequences of the other thing sounded dire. The politicians then found themselves in the invidious position of defending and implementing the thing they really didn’t vote for, or would not have given an ounce of integrity. 
Sympathetic British voters have been sending advice and best wishes to their American counterparts via social media. Tristram Hopgood, a civil servant from Winchester gave the least-twattish words of advice: 
“Ideally, one would avoid having a massive, bungling-man child with ridiculous yellow hair and no concept of poverty or morality anywhere near the process. If this is unavoidable, at least never allow him to act unsupervised and offer him a pretend steering-wheel on the family car and hope he is delighted with that. 
If you end up voting in a scary female super-villain who makes her shoes and cloak from the skins of puppies, it is best to dig a big hole and hide in it until the financial melt-down blows over. It should be noted that the lady in question is likely to show an unhealthy interest in all things nuclear within twenty-four hours of gaining office, so best dig that hole good and deep.” 
Media outlets world-wide have had an unexpectedly easy time of it preparing the front pages for the next day, with headlines reading: “America, what HAVE you done?”, regardless of the outcome.   Squudge   Squudge   World News 0",1
Daily Mail Editor Triggers Article 50,"November 8, 2016 
Notoriously mild-mannered editor of the Daily Mail, Paul Dacre, made his move to trigger Article 50 today, arguing that 49 articles about Brexit in his paper each day just wasn’t enough to get his message across. 
‘We’ve tried everything. ‘Take a Bow Britain’, ‘Enemies of the People’, ‘You’re all a bunch of European-loving t****’, noted Dacre placidly. ‘However, some people remain unconvinced by the softly-softly, measured, evidence based headline-making that is our hallmark. It’s time for more drastic measures.’ 
All features in the paper will now be expected to have a Brexit angle, with the exception of the daily filler piece on the dangers of statins, for which copy is already in the can for at least the next five years. 
Early sightings of tomorrow’s paper reveal a front-pager on the big overnight news from the US, revealing ‘Meghan Markle looking Supreme, that’s the Judgement of everyone, as she looks for a quick Brexit back to Stateside’. Crossword answers must now be drawn from a series of approved words, which include Brexit, May, Article 50, invoke, the, people, have, spoken, timetable, for, exit, now, now and NOW! The regular free garden seeds promotion will feature a new ‘sovereign Brtain’ bloom which the paper hopes will blossom ‘sometime in 2017′, but which the planting notes caution will need much attention and care from May. 
Some at the paper are said to be uncomfortable with Dacre’s new editorial policy, but they know that arguing with him is ultimately a futile exercise. ‘Colleagues say that likes to impose his will on the paper’, said one insider. ‘At least that’s what I think they meant when they talked about that big cock on the Mail.’   8th, 2016 by chrisf   chrisf   UK News 0",1
Fellated by a dead pig? You may have been a victim of Tory bullying,"November 8, 2016 
Helplines have been jammed with MPs and party activists suddenly remembering that 90% of their experience at elite private schools may constitute bullying – rather than good nature ‘joshing’ with a cricket bat and a ‘tube of lube’. Even the Prime Minister is said to have been abused during University initiations, Coalition negotiations and once at a dinner party by Rebekah Brooks ‘high on horse tranquilisers’. 
One MP, who did not want to be identified but who is the Right Honourable Member for Tatton, said: ‘Looking back at 44yrs of being a Tory, I’ve realised that it’s been non-stop bullying and preppy haircuts. I was emotionally abused by the hired help. Verbally abused by the electorate. And Vince Cable once put me in a headlock’. 
Ironically many severed animal parts may also have been on the receiving end of Tory hectoring or unwelcome coitus. Injury lawyers are anticipating a plethora of claims to be made by family members of animals forced into participating in Bullingdon Club rituals or photo opportunities. One spurious claim is that Boris Johnson, in 1989, may have swallowed half a dozen goldfish without ‘prior consent’, mistaking them for ‘salty table mints’. 
A Downing Street spokesman said: ‘Grant Shapps has been forced to resign, which is ironically an example of when bullying works to everyone’s benefit. However if you think you may have been mis-sold a PPI experience (or Porcum Penetratio Interrumpere as it is known) then please phone a lawyer or Lord Ashcroft – as he likes that sort of thing.’   8th, 2016 by Wrenfoe   Wrenfoe   From The Archives 0",1

Satire to resume writing itself,"November 9, 2016 
Satire, an archetype invented by classical Roman poets, has reversed a decision it took in early July and will continue taking charge of the global situation. Satirists, who had hoped to resume control of a vehicle that has now nullified itself by creating real world conditions so ridiculous that it is impossible to send them up, called the decision ‘disappointing but understandable’. 
‘Just to recap,’ said Satire, ‘I actually began all this in the States a year ago so it’s come full circle. The joke seemed to have gone stale after a while, so I switched to Britain. I whipped up an unnecessary referendum, chucked in some grotesque stock characters and got an overgrown blonde child to pretend to be for one side when he had been for the other just months before.’ 
‘I encouraged him to do just enough to get an honourable defeat, only to have him win so that his school chum who had been ruling the country had to resign. Then, I arranged for his weird sidekick to stab him in the back, only to get chucked out in turn, then let two demonic female figures fight it out and had one win who thought much the same as the original man about the original problem, which wasn’t really a problem at all and ensured she is bound to win an election on the decision, even though most people regret it.’ 
At that point, Satire took a back seat, agreeing that the possibility of a fictional orange-skinned character might become the world’s most powerful man after a campaign based on telling obvious lies, losing every debate and winning the evangelical vote by gripping vaginas was just too ridiculous to write about. Now, however, he has decided to make another go of it. 
‘OK, so I’m in my comfort zone now,’ Satire concluded. ‘The world’s leading nation devoting its entire energy to building a wall to stop brown-skinned people coming to do the jobs they won’t do themselves, people protesting against the 1% by voting for the epitome of the 1%, a thin-skinned, twice-bankrupt narcissist making decisions that will affect the whole world for a generation – it’s going to be epic. I mean, seriously, what’s the worst that could happen? … Nuclear war, you say? Hey, that could lead to another satire boom too. Boom – geddit? Did you see what I did there? Oh please yourselves…’ Share this story...

Confusion as Clinton Cards changes name to Trump Cards,"Posted: Nov 10th, 2016 by Guest   Guest   Ticker",1
Bricklayers rejoice!,"November 9, 2016 
The election of President Trump is not just a victory for orange people everywhere but an overwhelming mandate for those in the wall-building industry or Muslims who never wanted to visit the US. At last Americans can ‘grab pussies’ with impunity and give global warming the chance it deserves. 
With a sympathetic House and Supreme Court, Trump looks set to secure his vision of a gun in every cereal box, deporting California and ‘waterboarding for fun’. The US itself will naturally be rebranded as ‘Trump States™’; with a topless golf resort covering most of the mid-west. This will be followed by criminal charges against Hilary Clinton, Megan ‘Fox’ Kelly and all menstruators refusing to compete in his compulsory swimwear contest. 
Trump promised to unify a deeply divided country by imprisoning all pollsters – a decision warmly greeted by a confused electorate. In his first few days he is expected to repeal Obama-care, replacing it with the less socially inclusive ‘Who Cares?’ He will also eliminate debt, cut taxes and increase military spending – by simply redefining basic arithmetic. 
With Brexit now a dumb and distant memory, US voters confirmed that there is something worse than an Adam Sandler movie. Many await to see if Trump will keep his grandiose promises – such as free Trump-Steak for all, an end to billionaire-shaming and his long term commitment to ‘teabaging’ the Chinese President.

Snapchat Shares Plummet After Grown-Ups Figure Out How to Use It,"November 10, 2016 
Snapchat, the final evolutionary stage before society gives up on sentences altogether and we start communicating in a series of emotive grunts, has seen a steep fall in share prices after proper adults figure out how to use the application successfully. Observers have described the phenomenon, ‘Abnormal’, ‘Chilling’ and ‘Like watching a dog doing the hoovering – not something that should be in a sane world.’ 
The photographic bants-platform first believed adult use of Snapchat was an anomaly caused by over-protective parents rooting through their teenager’s belongings in search for evidence of pre-marital sex and ‘The Reefer’. However, pattern analysis of messages suggests the missives were sent intentionally as part of a deliberate campaign to be seen as, ‘Not hurtling inexorably towards the grave’. Company bosses are reported to be, ‘Gutted’. 
‘It’s a death knell’ said CEO Michaela Hodgkinson. ‘This will just about wipe out our user base. And we tried so hard. We made it so counter-intuitive to people who didn’t grow up with access to enough pixilated tits and ass to wrap multiple times round the Milky Way like an erotic flesh sausage. God, I wish it were the good old days, when adults treated innovation with the sort of suspicion usually reserved for men called ‘Mohammed’ walking into a small town Texan airport.’ 
‘It is a well-known fact that adolescents instinctively recoil from in shame, disgust and loathing to anything enjoyed by the over 30’s,’ explained youth-guru Samuel Cook. ‘Look at Michael Bolton. Once upon a time, the mere Herbal-Essence-esque swoosh of his flowing easy-listening locks could obliterate juvenile knickers like the oncoming of a Biblical flood; now, I’ve seen a teenager to projectile vomit the words, ‘Cock-nugget’ just by hearing the opening bars to ‘When A Man Loves A Woman’. 
Experts suggest that teenagers’ influence over what is cool acts as compensation for a future without the possibility of jobs, savings, or affordable housing, at least until their parents pop their clogs and they can wrench a decent standard of living out of their elder’s hoary baby-boomer claws. Teenagers are expected to flee the social media site like rats aboard a sinking over-60s cruise ship and seek pastures even more disorientating and obtuse. Prospective new digital street-corners-outside-the-offie include, ‘Bluster’, ‘Waffle’ and a messaging service where users communicate entirely using quotes from the 1988 film Beetlejuice. S-Bahn",1
“Ignorant scum who disagree with me should be more tolerant” complains voter,"November 11, 2016 
Following America’s shock election result, a voter has complained of increasing polarisation in the country between people who agree with her and “ignorant scum”. 
“I just don’t recognise this country any more,” she said sadly. “I remember a time we could discuss things in a civil manner, with everyone being respectful of each other’s opinions.” 
“Nowadays this seems to be impossible, due to the existence of people who obviously must be racist, misogynist knuckle-dragging arsewipes since they disagree with me.” 
She also expressed concern that her political opponents harboured authoritarian tendencies, and said the sooner they were rounded up and put into camps the better “so that a more inclusive and tolerant political discourse can flourish again”. YaBasta",1
Re-appraisal of Mark Twain underway after discovery of ‘good wank spoiled’ note,"November 12, 2016 
Historians were undertaking a frantic reassessment of the contribution of Mark Twain yesterday, after the surprise discovery of a box of jottings by the famous American author, known for his sparkling epigrams. The box, containing notes from his early life in Missouri was uncovered during a spring clean of the Twain family home in Connecticut, now a working museum dedicated to the literary legend. On one note, Twain wrote that ‘golf is a good wank spoiled’, casting considerable doubt on the commonly held view that he was comparing the sport unfavourably to a walk in the park. 
‘Twain was a prodigious masturbator as a teenager, that much we know from published memoirs, and the extensive porn collection found under his mattress,’ indicated Cecile De Mornay, Professor of American Literature at Oxford University. ‘These new notes reveal much about the state of his mind – and his trousers – during his formative years. As he entered adolescence, it seems he struggled to find much privacy in the family home, so he would often sneak off to the local golf club to snap one out.’ 
‘The local toilets at the club provided him with a nice quiet space for him to bash his bishop,’ continued De Mornay. ‘Frustratingly for him, sometimes, other members of the golf club would spot him before he reached the toilets, and, understandably, they would invite him to join them for 18 holes, thus spoiling his regular bouts of self-discovery. A round of fourballs, rather than his preference for a solitary game with two balls and a wood, if you like.’ 
Experts suggest that this discovery will not be a long term stain on Twain’s reputation, although the impact on his bedsheets is a different matter. ‘Twain’s place in the spotlight will come again’, concluded De Mornay confidently. ‘Although, with this new discovery, it is actually his come that is being placed under the spotlight.’ Share this story...

Americans ‘whoop’ at literally anything,"November 12, 2016 
American people will shout ‘wooo!’ loudly at absolutely anything, evidence suggests. 
Republican supporters whooped after every single word of Donald Trump’s victory speech on Wednesday, despite the fact it clearly heralded a new low point for Western culture. 
Democrats then whooped throughout Hillary Clinton’s first appearance after conceding defeat – even the part where she said she was going to spend the rest of her life crying in a cupboard. 
While Clinton supporters have largely calmed down, Republicans remain in a state of continuous and indiscriminate whooping at everything from a cat walking into a room to the idea of starting a war with Canada. 
Texan Trump supporter Nick Bob Cyrus-Ferguson said: ‘Let’s get started on this Mexico wall. Woo! Then we’re gonna scrap free trade agreements. Woo! I don’t even know what that means. Woo!

Man fakes heart attack to avoid repeated ‘thanks’ to same person,"November 12, 2016 
A Romford man has admitted feigning a cardiac arrest in order to prevent a situation whereby he would have had to thank the same person up to five times for holding a series of doors open for him. 
Office worker, Dave Simmons, 35, explained that his workplace contains a number of long corridors, partitioned into sections by a series of five double-doors. 
“A guy I don’t really know got to the first door before me,” Explained the embarrassed HR assistant. “He noticed I was following so he held it open for me. I thanked him, and you’d think that was that. Well, not by a long chalk.” 
“When we got to the second door, we both realised what was going to unfold,” Said Simmons who had just been forcibly ejected from the local A&E department. “So he held the second door and I thanked him again.” 
“As etiquette requires, we both snorted a laugh and shook our heads but by this time we realised that a third door was coming up and we were both crippled with embarrassment – I mean, what’s the protocol here? I don’t know, that’s for sure.” 
“So after the third door I just laughed too loud and about halfway up the next bit of corridor I grabbed my chest, hit the deck and started making an alarming wheezing noise. I could tell we were both relieved.” 
The door-holder in question was an office temp who had only been working at the building for a few days and it was he who called the ambulance. 
“It’ll take me a while to get over this,” Said the minimum-wage earner. “It was so embarrassing, but thanks to Mr. Simmons’s quick thinking I’ll know what to do next time. Probably put it on my CV.” 
Simmons says the fact that he may face legal proceedings for misuse of the emergency services does not make him regret his actions. 
“I’d do it again in a heartbeat – no pun intended.” He said, clearly intending the pun. UniversalExile",1

Lego refuse to build Trump’s wall,"November 13, 2016 
Under the hashtag ‘StopFundingHate’ the Danish firm have ceased collaboration with Republicans, The Daily Mail and James Corden’s agent. Citing ethical reasons, the toy manufacturer said they would continue to make Star Wars-themed Death Stars but had declined to Donald Trump’s request for a ‘full-sized’ one. 
Despite being the nemesis of bare feet everywhere, Lego were keen to distance themselves from any negative publicity – withdrawing from plans for a Lego Boko Haram ‘Adventure Playground’, Lego Kim Jong-Un with Missile Launcher and Lego Mrs Brown’s Boys ‘House of Fun’. Instead their focus will be on a ‘Brexit Box of Bricks'; which lacks any plan and, despite promises on the packaging, can not be used to build any hospitals whatsoever. 
Lego’s rejection leaves Mr. Trump no choice but to assemble his 2,000 mile wall out of pulped copies of the Koran; held together with ‘whatever the hell’ he uses as hair glue. Sadly Mexico had already agreed to pay for the construction costs, but, like most parents this Christmas, had balked at the material cost of using Lego. 
Meanwhile The Daily Mail will no longer give away toys but will continue to dispense fear for free. Likewise Mr. Trump has said he will keep his election promises without Lego; replacing Obamacare with ‘Doc McStuffins’, waterboarding with ‘Super Soakers’ and any non-compliant women with ‘Barbie’– or Ivana as she is known.

This firm is a breeding ground for interdepartmental turf wars, and we must implement some basic cross-functional solutions’.

Sarkozy admits French language a hoax after Wikileaks exposé,"November 14, 2016 
After yesterday’s Wikileaks revelations, Nicolas Sarkozy has today confirmed that the “French language” is indeed a one thousand year old hoax. The president of France revealed that what purported to be his native tongue was in fact complete gibberish, admitting the French really speak English, except in the presence of the British. This comes as Wikileaks published cables sent by French diplomats to countries such as Spain, China and Russia which were all found to be written in English. 
During a speech given in received pronunciation, the French President came clean, stating that it all started off as a joke during William the Conquerer’s invasion to make the aggressors seem a bit more exotic. “What was initially a prank snowballed and after a few years we realised we’d look silly revealing the truth, so we had to keep up the façade,” said the Premier. “In the company of any Brits we would try to make convincingly “French” sounds, a mixture of guttural grunts and rapid-fire syllables. 
But as soon as we were on our own we’d all heave a huge sigh of relief and revert to English. We developed a heavy reliance on hand gestures to cover up when we ran out of likely noises, and the shrug was a particular boon if inspiration dried up. In the end we became quite the raconteurs, with an impressive array of supposed vocabulary. So what began as a game for the élites, became a hobby across all levels of society, and it shocked us that the Brits were so naïve as to not see through the charade.” 
Sarkozy claims Wikileaks will soon expose a number of other “languages”. “I mean, seriously guys, has anyone ever actually listened to “Arabic”? Je ne sais pas…..”

Trump sues ‘Trumpton’,"November 14, 2016 
The stop-motion children’s favourite, is under threat from the newly elected President for using his trademarked name. Mr. Trump has turned litigious after his planning permission was blocked, for golf resort in neighbouring Camberwick Green. 
Explained Town Hall clerk, Mr Troop: ‘Several landowners around Trumpton and Camberwick Green refused to sell their land to Trump. And he’s made their lives misery, in some cases he’s even cut off their water supply and blocked their roads.’ Local windmill owner Windy Miller has been in dispute with Trump over the sale of land around Colley’s Mill and the Trump Corporation’s aggressive tactics appear to have taken their toll on the normally affable Miller. ‘It’s terrible what they’ve done to Windy,’ says Mr Troop. ‘He’s a broken man. Now he spends his days getting wrecked on home brew cider and firing his shotgun at anyone who comes within 100 yards of his windmill. Peter the Postman has had to visit Dr Mopp several times to have shotgun slugs removed from his rear end’. 
However, not everyone in Trumpton is hostile to the billionaire property developer. Local carpenter Chippy Minton believes that just as Trump is set to bring radical change to America he can do the same for Trumpton. ‘The people are fed up with the career politicians at the town hall. Unless you’re an immigrant or disabled they don’t want to know, bloody do-gooders. Everyone knows there’s too much immigration from neighbouring towns. We’re going to build a wall around Chigley and make Chigley pay for it’. 
‘There’s even a Mexican family moved in to Trumpton,’ continued Minton. ‘They seem nice but this type of immigration is diluting our local institutions. Take our world famous Fire Brigade for instance. Now it’s ‘Pugh, Pugh, Barney McGrew, Cuthbert, Dibble, Ramirez’. What’s that all about!?’",1
UKIP urge government to ‘do something’ about the supermoon,"November 14, 2016 
‘It’s clear the moon is making an attempt to enter the UK, illegally and under the cover of darkness,’ said a UKIP spokesman citing the UKIP science expert Douglas Carswell. ‘What other reason would it have for coming so close?’ 
The claim has been backed up by The Daily Mail that states there could be ‘up to one million immigrants’ hiding on the dark side, suggesting that a ladder made of Lego bricks would effect a sneaky and virtually undetectable access point that could be dismantled in a blink of an eye. 
Other newspapers are less confident about the claim, with the Daily Express noting it was ‘too distracted by the news that Princess Di is dead.’ Share this story...

Met Office promises ‘gloomiest sky for 70 years’,"November 14, 2016 
Meteorologists were today said to be ‘cautiously optimistic’ that the skies over much of Britain would tonight be the gloomiest in living memory. ‘You might think a grey sky is a grey sky is a grey sky,’ said weather watcher Ron Webster. ‘But I assure you there are grey skies and there are grey skies. Tonight will be a real eye opener, not that that will make a lot of difference.’ 
Called a ‘Supergloom’, the phenomenon occurs whenever there’s something worth seeing in the night skies over England. ‘A good view of the ISS, a meteor shower, a comet, some planets in alignment. You can guarantee that if there’s anything remotely interesting happening above our heads, atmospheric conditions will combine to create this impenetrable blanket of murk.’ 
Sure enough, tonight’s sky-full of dull coincides with a full moon that would have appeared slightly larger and brighter than usual, had anyone not in an aircraft been able to see it. (Keen photographers wishing to record the spectacle have been advised to download a shot of any full moon and ‘blow it up a bit’.) 
But for fans of the overcast like Ron Webster, tonight’s damp, dismal and funereal sky will be something to behold. ‘I’m literally over the moon,’ he said, ‘and any other celestial phenomena.’ Share this story...

Morrissey children’s album flops,"November 15, 2016 
Former Smiths frontman Morrissey says he is ‘currently contemplating the warm, welcoming embrace of early retirement’ after his album of songs for children ‘Hello Young Persons Everywhere’ failed to chart this weekend. The album, a long-standing ambition for the singer, contains a number of reworked children’s standards including ‘This Old Man, He Played One’ and ‘The Wheels on the Bus’ along with a selection of self-penned numbers including ‘Algebra is a Frightful Bore’ and ‘It is Inadvisable to Commence Your Sentences With a Gerund’. ‘It was my intention to offer today’s younger folk entertainment of an improving nature’ remarked the singer ‘as an alternative to the abominations that are the likes of Hannah Montana and Chuggington. It appears that the entertainment industry has pulled together along with the British Brainwashing Corporation to prevent such an endeavour from ever succeeding.’ Another organisation no longer supporting the singer is The Early Learning Centre who had planned a promotional tie-in with the album’s release. They withdrew support upon hearing the lead single ‘I Know an Old Woman Who Swallowed a Fly’: ‘I know an old woman, who swallowed a fly, And because of this careless old lady, This innocent fly will die Fly will die (x5) ‘I know an old woman, who swallowed a fly, Oh ignorant greedy old woman, I hope that you suddenly die, Hurry up and die (x7)’ Morrissey is keen to stress that despite quitting music, he will not be shunning the limelight. ‘I am already in negotiations with the producers of QI about joining their fragrant and estimable team. Meanwhile, I am ready to unleash my first book for the teenage market. I consider it a necessary counterbalance to the inanities of Eugenia Lavender and Budgie the Helicopter.’ The book: ‘Eats, Shoots and Dates: How the Poor Grammar and Punctuation of Others Has Long Ruined my Chances of Finding Lasting Love’ is published by McMillan in March.

Anniversaries are becoming more frequent,"November 15, 2016 
Sunday was the anniversary of the Bataclan attack, just recently was the 1,000th anniversary of the Battle of Hastings and the 50th anniversary of the Aberfan disaster. Yet there is no record of anyone commemorating the first anniversary of the Battle of Hastings in 1067, nor the 100th anniversary in 1166. 
It has gradually crept up on us though. At first, only significant anniversaries were recognised, numbers like 25, 50 or 100; but gradually it has spread to any year ending in ‘0’ or can easily be fitted onto a badge. If we don’t stop the trend then before long every year will be an anniversary of something that happened before.

God Issues Apology For 2016 Celebrity Cull,"November 15, 2016 
In an official statement released this afternoon, God has apologised for the ongoing massacre of talent this year, blaming it on recent pressure to beef up Heaven’s on-site entertainment. The statement, published on the Vatican website, claimed that the deaths were needed to shake-up a flagging variety line-up currently dominated by tambourine-heavy U2 tribute acts and weak parable-based comedy sketches. 
‘Have you any fucking idea how boring Christians are?’ said one Archangel,who asked to remain anonymous. ‘Sure, they mean well but they don’t half know how to suck the life out of everything. Bowie, on the other hand, has already released a version of ‘Kum Ba Yah’ that sent shivers down my spine, and Prince’s rendition of ‘All Things Bright and Beautiful’ had the cherubs dry-humping their harps.’ 
Speaking directly to reporters outside the Pearly Gates, God acknowledged that the deaths had compounded the misery of one of the worst years in decades but called it a ‘necessary evil’. ‘I appreciate it sucks for you guys but, seriously, have you any idea how good our nativity play is going to be this year?’ He said. 
‘We’ve already got Alan Rickman signed up to play Herod, naturally, and I almost shat myself laughing when Gene Wilder started doing his Archangel Gabriel. There was a bit of a bun fight over whether Mary would be played by Victoria Wood or Caroline Aherne, but that’s the price you pay for having so much talent available. Leonard Cohen and Robert Vaughn are sadly now joining the cast to beef up the wise men. You’re lucky we don’t have any wildlife up here,’ he added, ‘otherwise Attenborough would have been underneath a bus months ago.’ Charlie Stuart",1

For many years men have struggled buying clothes that are not a suit or a pair of jeans, but finally we have made some progress. A team of scientists gathered from Oxford, Cambridge and John Lewis are said to be near to a clear definition of ‘smart casual’– somewhere equidistant between bland and gimp.

Giant James May terrorises Kent after being given ‘wrong kind of growth hormones’,"November 17, 2016 
Kent woke today to scenes of carnage after a giant James May roamed the countryside overnight, leaving a trail of destruction in his wake. 
Scientists at the Kent Institute of Pharmacology admitted that May, 47, had agreed to take part in a trial of an experimental new drug aimed at getting middle-aged men to ‘just grow up’. Unfortunately the drug had the undesired effect of making him grow to five storeys tall, from which height it is believed that May’s instinct ‘to treat everything like a giant train set’ kicked in. 
Whitstable was particularly badly hit when rush hour traffic was swept off the road by May’s huge hands so he could force Jeremy Clarkson and Richard Hammond to race each other in two Robin Reliants made of lego. Eyewitness said he later tried to attach an electricity pylon to Clarkson’s car so he could play scaletrix but grew enraged when the wires tangled in his ample fringe, and threw Clarkson over a hill, before running off in the direction of Ashford. 
Despite a body count of 3000 and rising, residents of Kent are urged to remain calm, and to talk about cars as much as possible in the hope of creating a familiar and soothing background noise for the confused beast. They are also urged to protect their homes and vehicles by putting up the posters Oz Clarke being airdropped by the RAF across the county. 
Richard Hammond strenuously denied that this is yet another zany Top Gear stunt, claiming that ‘a giant James May wandering around causing mayhem really wouldn’t be that entertaining’. Jeremy Clarkson meanwhile hit back at Kent Council’s objection James May destroying the centre of Canterbury and killing thousands; ‘It’s just another example of the health and safety nanny state gone mad!’

Trump gifts Farage Idaho,"November 16, 2016 
The President-erect has rewarded Nigel Farage, the People’s Prime Minister, with a significant portion of real estate and the keys to Ivana Trump. Addressing a packed crowd of cowering press, Mr. Trump said: ‘To thank Mr Farage for being a really great guy and good people, very good people, I have decided to give him the state of Idaho, for his own use and which he can pass on to whoever he wishes should he not be like me and immortal’. 
‘He can do whatever he fancies to it. My advice would be to turn it into a golf course. And if you see any Canadians on it, shoot them. Only kidding there folks. Canadians never bother to go to Idaho, it’s too nondescript even for them. Anyway, Neil, go ahead. The state is all yours. You can twirl it around by the fuzzy bits for all I care. We’ve got plenty more states, 50 of them. You may need it to retire to, if what Mr Putin tells me is true. And I don’t care what all you carpet munching communists of the press say, Mr Putin’s great people, believe me.’ 
Mr Farage, 37, clearly delighted, said: ‘I am clearly delighted. This is the greatest day of my life apart from the one where we left Europe, the one where I asked the head of the European Commission, ‘Who are ya, who are ya?’, and when I won eight per cent of the vote in Bromley & Chislehurst, pushing Labour into fourth place. I shall be delighted to own Idaho, and thanks to a loan from Trumpfinance Inc, will be building a palace, the Farage Tower, in the state capital. Uh, what is the state capital of Idaho again?’ 
‘Who’s got the last laugh, eh? And I shall be advising President Trump that the sooner he leaves this treacherous union of states that is ruining America, the better. It’s time for Amexit.’ immacagain",1

MP delighted HS2 avoids wife’s inheritance,"November 17, 2016 
As the final route for HS2 was announced, one MP was particularly gleeful: ‘I and my constituents are delighted with the proposed route, which not only avoids my safe seat but which will protect my majority for years to come. Coincidentally my wife’s parents’ modest Jacobean house and 400 acres are also unaffected’. 
The benefits are manifest, for example, a businessman in Sheffield will be able to put his racing pigeons on a train and they would reach London 30 minutes earlier than they would now. The aggregate time saved would mean he would be able to have another 5 races per year. Yes a number of homes will have to be demolished, but this is on a par with the slum clearances of the 50s & 60s. 
When asked if there was really the need for a high speed rail link over a comparatively short distance, the MP replied: ‘Who doesn’t want to see 60 trains a day travelling past the bottom of their garden at 250 miles per hour?’ pippip",1
Published – ‘Dictionary’ – the post-truth edition,"November 17, 2016 
Having named post-truth as the word of the year, The Oxford English Dictionary’s post truth edition will be available online tomorrow, after a book launch on the moon in 1835, attended by Elvis Presley and Winnie the Pooh. The hardback edition will cost $50,000, but most branches of Waterstones will not mind if you nick it. 
‘It’s the first time a major linguistic work has been edited by a koala bear,’ said post truth OED editorial director and pantomime horse Ian Smythe, playing down rumours (which he denies starting himself) about the size of his genitals. ‘The volume will be of enormous help to newspaper editors, students, political observers scientists and academics entering a world where the very idea of truth has to be examined by standing on a stepladder made of raspberry jelly and shouting ‘Rabbi, let’s tap-dance to Tewskbury!’ 
In the UK, the Murdoch press and the Mail group of newspapers say the official launch of the Post Truth era won’t make any difference whatsoever to their editorial policy, announcing that the £350 million pounds a week payable to the NHS has already started and queues waiting for treatment at hospitals are being ignored by immigrant doctors planning suicide attacks on Clarence House and smoking skunk supplied by Diane Abbott. 
Meanwhile in the USA the much respected newspaper the Washington Post has launched a new weekly paper called the Washington Post Truth, reporting that Bernie Sanders won the presidential election, Nigel Farage was killed by a falling block of frozen urine traceable back to Air Force One, Bill Cosby has had a new show green lit co starring Monica Lewinsky and the Brexit Referendum ended in a dead heat. 
The manufacturers of self adhesive Post It notes have also joined post truth culture by launching a new range of ‘Post Truth It’ notes, bearing pre-printed messages like ‘Have gone to the pictures with Nicole Kidman/Brad Pitt/Lembit Opik’; ‘You do have to work to be mad here’ and ‘This note isn’t sticky so it has fallen off the fridge and you are not reading it.’ Share this story...

Bus drivers no longer in charge of quantitative easing,"November 17, 2016 
Global financial markets were in turmoil today after a Leeds bus driver announced that ‘I’m not the f*@king Bank of England, mate’, after a passenger tried to pay for a £2.80 fare with a ten pound note. The surprise revelation triggered an immediate worldwide crash, as speculators and investors reacted to the shock news that the bus driving community was not responsible for maintaining the monetary and financial stability of the nation, as had been previously thought. 
‘This news has sent a tremor through the banking system, as bus drivers have been the custodians of British currency since 1634,’ noted financial historian Michael Porteous. ‘It should have actually been 1631, but Frank was three minutes late leaving the Kirkstall Road depot this afternoon due to roadworks on the A65’. 
‘Drivers are given updates every minute from the major global stock exchanges, relayed to them on tiny screens attached to their rear view mirror’, continued Porteous. ‘This allows them to make split-second adjustments, releasing particular coins into general circulation from those little trigger dispensers if more liquidity is required, or retaining them to meet government monetary targets. More bloody retention than releasing, you say? I couldn’t comment.’ 
Up until recently drivers were trained up to ask belligerently ‘Have you NOT got anything less?’ when any note was offered as payment, before throwing a fistful of low-denomination copper at passengers. They were also mandated to regularly drive past bus-stops full of pensioners on rainy Fridays between 9-11am, if inflation targets had been overshot. ‘Their role in ensuring the financial system runs smoothly shouldn’t be under-estimated,’ concluded Porteous. ‘That’s why your bus driver never even acknowledges you when you get on and looks fixedly into the middle-distance – they’re making complex split-second asset purchase calculations. Alternatively, it may be because they despise you, with that pathetic excuse of a hail that you do, arm half bent and shaking, every sodding day, before getting on and trying to pay with a bloody twenty for your pathetic one-mile journey. For Christ’s sake, can’t you look for some pound coins before you leave, you selfish, middle class tw@t.’ Share this story...

Trump in gender transition confusion,"November 18, 2016 
White House staff have been briefed to expect the President Elect, but Republican officials are yet to confirm if he will be arriving as Donald or his trans-identity – Juanita. So muddled has the process of transition been, that Mr. Trump has lost track of his election promises, his gender and his – already slim – grasp on reality. 
While transitions of any kind can be traumatic, the emergence of an orange Juanita may be one change too many for an electorate unready for a female President. A Trump spokeswoman remarked: ‘Voters are not binary. Choosing between competent candidates – they want a third bat-shit-crazy option, such as Donald – I mean Juanita. And if he/she/it wants to offer a third or even fourth gender, then so be it’. 
Of course this is not the first time a new President has tried to redefine themselves; who can forget George W. as Forest Gump Clinton as Pepe Le Pew or Obama as the Kenyan founder of ISIS. Trump offered a reassurance that he would be President for all, a First Lady for some and a Border Guard for about three million Latinos Share this story...

An oily spokesman for MailOnline said that the post-truth age had left red-top journalists with nowhere to go: ‘They’ve got to be prepared to believe even more ridiculous things now, what with truth being such a fluid concept. Speaking of fluids, is it 10am yet? I make it a rule never to have a drink before then’

Big Society success as community choir takes control of policing,"November 18, 2016 
Prime Minister David Cameron has hailed the success of his Big Society programme, citing the example of South Oxhey Community Choir, which has been appointed to take control of all policing and crime issues in the area. 
Mr Cameron says: ‘The Big Society is about giving control of public services back to community groups and charities. What these local activists lack in experience, funding, training and competence they more than make up for with enthusiasm and their own gardening tools.’ 
Robert Fette, the Musical Director of the Choir says, ‘We were actually bidding to run an after-schools music project for 8-16 year olds. But beggars can’t be choosers, so we’re going to combine our challenging programme of Tippet, Purcell and Britten with upholding law and order, detecting the perpetrators of serious crime and the random kettling of student protestors.’ 
During one busy evening last week, a desperate 999 call redirected to the choir saw the tenors despatched to a local warehouse, where an abortive burglary had resulted in a security guard being held hostage by a desperate drug-addicted gunman. After the choristers used old police loud hailers to sing a couple of verses of ‘Stand By Me’, the gunman gave himself up. He has been promised that he can sing ‘Smack My Bitch Up’ in next month’s hugely anticipated community concert. 
‘Our busy rehearsal schedule means that we cannot spend as much time as we would like preparing statements when cases come to trial, but at least our evidence is presented with a vibrant and ever-changing accompaniment of pop, gospel, classical and world music that certainly brightens up court proceedings.’ 
Elsewhere in the district, South Oxhey Cat Rescue has won control of the Meals on Wheels service previously provided by the council. Ms Moira Finnegan, who heads up South Oxhey Cat Rescue, says: ‘This is very exciting. Obviously it means the elderly will have to eat tinned cat food, but the way the cuts were shaping up, that was bound to happen anyway.’ 
However, it is not all good news for Mr Cameron. The case against the gunman in the Oxhey warehouse siege collapsed after the judge in the case suspended the trial and went home to watch television. Judge Shanika Thompson, aged 9, said she was bored of volunteering to be a judge and asked if she could go back to being school library monitor instead. Share this story...

Facebook bans 99% of users for posting fake news,"November 18, 2016 
As part of efforts to halt the dissemination of inaccurate reporting and propaganda on social media, Facebook has now blocked all status updates by ‘fake’ happy families. Likewise in the interests of truth, all images of new possessions will now be accompanied by scans of the various debtor agency letters, credit card warnings and the inevitable divorce certificate. 
‘Identifying “the truth” is actually quite difficult in an algorithm-driven environment,’ explained CEO Mark Zuckerber. ‘But anyone could see that the shots of this happy couple on a beach in Marbella were entirely bogus, considering the discovery of her clandestine affair, and his ongoing problem drinking.’ 
Unfortunately Facebook is awash with liars – like holier-than-thou Animal Rights supporters who secretly scoff burgers. Or staged images of ‘angelic’ grandchildren – who off camera are referred to as ‘snotty little shits’ who talk through the soaps. The same with sunset views of shapely legs; they are just photo-shopped knees, which normally resemble a pair of bowling bowls ‘lost in a sausage factory’. 
Anticipating a serious loss of revenue from lack of usership, Zuckerberg has announced plans for ‘FuckOffBook’– catering to the new straight-talking age of Brexit and Trump. It will encourage ‘honest’ discourse between new users with faeces and middle finger emojis. ‘We will not rest in our commitment to ending the scourge of fake news. And that’s as sure as Hillary Clinton ordered 9/11, and President Elect Trump won the popular vote.’ Dr Turmoil & SJ Roe (team effort!) Share this story...

Electric Cars Must Run Behind Man With Flag,"  National Highway Traffic Safety Administration in the USA today gave clarification on the soon to be imposed safety measures required for electric cars. In addition to a two-tone siren that must sound the word “Pus-sy!” and a yellow strobe light mounted on the roof, all owners must carry a man who will walk in front of the car holding a red flag. 
‘The NHTSA has worked long and hard on these proposals with our colleagues in Detroit,’ a spokesman – George MustangVEight – said. ‘Over one Americans every year are injured by electric cars and we aim to resolve this unacceptable risk to our citizens with these actions. Plus, the forced employment of a pedestrian speed retarder by all owners of these dangerous vehicles will do wonders for the unemployment these blights have caused in our oil and petrochemical industries.’ 
In California, Tesla Motors owner Elon Musk remained positive: ‘It’s fine. I’m currently working on a way to convert electricity using the phone lines as a transport medium. I’m sure we can have it running in beta by 2020. Failing that we may soon be able to transubstantiate the intolerable smugness of their owners into pure energy’. james_doc",1
New family in Coronation Street to ‘keep themselves to themselves’,"  Glazebrooks, a family of three who last week moved into a semi-detached house in Coronation Street, say they have little interest in getting involved with the community in their new home in Weatherfield. 
‘We like the quiet life,’ said 48-year-old Barry, an insurance underwriter. ‘We got the place at a knock-down price thanks to that recent thing we read in the local news about a tram crashing into a nightclub and killing four people. I only chose Weatherfield for the easy commute – which hopefully it will be, once the trams are up and running again.’ 
As a near-teetotaller, Barry added that he does not envisage spending much time in the local pub, the Rovers Return Inn. ‘Besides, what with the last four landlords packing it in in acrimonious circumstances, lorries crashing into it and it being burnt to the ground, an attempted murder in the cellar and arguments going on there most nights, it doesn’t sound like my sort of place,’ he added. 
His 17-year-old son Philip, who has now settled in well at the local fee-paying academy Oakhill School, said that he had no plans for romantic entanglements. ‘Don’t get me wrong,’ he told reporters, ‘I’ve seen that Tracey Barlow from down the road and I definitely would, and I’ve heard there’s some lesbian action going on down at the Websters’, but I just have no time for that sort of thing with my A-levels coming up.’ 
Meanwhile, Mary Glazebrook, 45, who decided against seeking work at the local clothing factory because she doesn’t believe it’s healthy to spend all her time closeted in a single small street, is reluctant to mix with her neighbours. 
‘I mean, take that Gail McIntyre,’ she said. ‘She seemed nice enough when she said hello to me, but it turns out she has a long history of feuding with her mother-in-laws, her first husband was murdered, her second one was a serial killer who tried to kill her whole family by driving her car into a canal, her daughter got pregnant at 13, her son is a borderline psychopath, her long-last father came back after 30 years and turned out to be gay, then to top it all she married the debt-ridden father of the son’s girlfriend and ended up in prison accused of his murder when he fell off a boat. Honestly, you couldn’t make it up.’ 
As of today, the Glazebrooks have no plans to have a housewarming. ‘To be honest,’ continued Mary, ‘I don’t think we could fit it in, what with hosting our swingers parties and sacrificing animals to Satan. Besides, I really need to have that conversation with Barry about how he’s not actually Philip’s dad – his brother is.’ Share this story...

Top 10 Scary List: Ghosts replaced by Trump,"November 19, 2016 
While ISIS, Jimmy Saville and the popularity of Kanye West have recently hurt ghouls’ solid position in the scare lists; the election of an orange-faced sociopath into the position of the world’s number one nuke holder has finally put the nail in their rotten coffins. ‘Ghosts are so 1840′ said one industry insider. ‘All that lace and self-reflection. They are now seen as more fabulous than fearful. Gwen Stefani has got 7 in her latest music video and Haunted Hill was just bought up by Sandals.’ 
Derek Acorah explained: ‘They need to be more Tarantino, less Lloyd-Webber. Zombies got sprinty, clowns lost the big shoes and blood-sucking vampires just took up banking’. jimiedge",1

Hi David, 
We have been told, and we are preparing to report, that the FBI has taken possession of the thumb drive that was once in your possession. This is what we have been informed, and we wanted to see whether there was any sort of comment that could be provided. If you wanted to steer us away and say that we are misinformed, then I would gladly accept that as well . But we have solid reason to believe this. We’d welcome any comment you can offer. Thanks very much. 
Eric Associated Press reporter says he knows it’s true, but will gladly print that it’s false 
What’s truly astonishing in this email is how AP reporter Eric Tucker says he will gladly LIE to cover for the Clintons . In plain English, he explains that he has “solid reason” to believe the report about the thumb drive, but he will gladly publish a false narrative via the Associated Press , and he even suggests what that false narrative should be: “If you wanted to steer us away and say that we are misinformed, then I would gladly accept that as well.” 
In other words, he’s not just corrupt, dishonest and fraudulent as a journalist, he’s also SUGGESTING the false narrative the Clintons should use! 
This is the exact same way the AP talks to the CDC about vaccines and measles, by the way. Essentially, the Associated Press reporters say, “We are total media whores, we will bend over and grab our ankles while you shove your fake story down the throats of our readers who foolishly think we’re a credible news organization.” 
You gotta love Eric Tucker for this. The guy takes the prize for finally spelling out in black and white what we’ve known for years: the AP is a total joke when it comes to real journalism . Note carefully that the AP won’t even fire Tucker for this admission. He’ll probably get a prize of some sort. How many other Associated Presstitutes have deliberately LIED to cover up Clinton crimes? 
It all brings to mind the obvious question: How many other Associated Presstitutes deliberately lied to cover up Clinton crimes? 
Just what percentage of AP stories about the Clinton scandals are actually FAKE NEWS pretending to be credible journalism? (Answer: Probably about 99%.) 
It’s not just AP, either. It’s the same story at every other mainstream news organization across America: They’re all liars and crooks, and they’re all working for Hillary Clinton, the serial killer and rape excuser.

YouTube censoring videos – on censorship!,"YouTube censoring videos – on censorship! share in: Education , Google , Journalism YouTube has yet again censored another educational video from Prager University. The content of the banned video? Criticism of censorship; hopefully the irony of their choice to remove it isn’t lost on YouTube’s executives. The video, titled The Dark Art of Political Intimidation, was released last week and features Kimberly Strassel. Strassel is a Wall Street Journal columnist who explains tactics commonly used by the leftists to shut down free speech from the right. This included blackmail, harassment and intimidation. Back in 2010, the IRS started to target conservative non-profit organizations intentionally. Groups were experiencing heavy delays when trying to aquire tax exempt non-profit status. This was an attempt to curb their political involvement in the 2012 election, explained Strassel. A Democratic prosecutor in Wisconsin launched a shadow campaign of financial investigation against conservatives. Their houses were raided before sunrise, with accompanying gag orders to keep them quiet about the raids. The reason for all that was revenge for supporting the Republican Governor Scott Walker. Kimberly Strassel highlights even more examples in the five-minute video showing censorship of political opponents. Youtube placed the video into restricted mode — which is a common filter used by schools, libraries and parents to shield their children from outrageously obscene and graphic content. NewsBusters reports: “Conservative radio host Dennis Prager’s idea for PragerU is to give students alternative, non-progressive takes on history, civics and other issues. there’s no cursing, no violence or any kind of indecency in any of them.” Prager University’s videos including those that have been censored are all G rated. This leaves questions about why the popular video platform is placing restrictions on them. At least 21 additional videos produced by the conservative not for profit educational organization that is Prager University have been placed into restricted mode by Youtube. There is a petition circulating to stop the censorship, which has aquired over 76,000 signatures so far. Hopefully, YouTube will get its act together about restricting videos that pose no threat to children. Better yet, they should make some key changes to their algorithms to prevent this from happening in the future. A Youtube statement given to Wall Street Journal stated, “[V]ideo restrictions are decided by an ‘algorithm’ that factors in ‘community flagging’ and ‘sensitive content.’” Basically progressives tripped the algorithm in an attempt to limit free speech and political involvement from conservatives. YouTube has lifted the restriction on The Dark Art of Political Intimidation this past weekend, thanks to the Wall Street Journal giving them a very hard time over the censorship. Sources: ",1
"The Rothschild Family has corrupted global banks, news media, oil and government","The Rothschild Family has corrupted global banks, news media, oil and government share in: Central banks , Currency & debt , Deception , Energy , Freedom 
The New World Order might seem a bit far-fetched for many. A handful of powerful people acting as puppet masters for the human race is a thought that might not even cross the minds of many that have seamlessly adapted to the beliefs that were instilled in them from a young age. The thought that we are all being controlled and enslaved by the banks with the aid of the government is for conspiracy theorists. There is no doubt that there are negative connotations associated with being a conspiracy theorist. That belief has been re-iterated many times, mostly from the mainstream media. There are people who see the world for what they are told it is, others see what’s really going on behind the curtain. The stranglehold the global elite have on money and knowledge makes them very powerful. They either directly or indirectly control every aspect of our lives. 
Global mega-corporations make up to billions of dollars on an annual basis. A select few at the top of the company make absurd amounts of money, while the employees making the difference and driving the company forward are barely paid enough money to stay afloat. If humans stay busy working 40 weekly hours for very little income, they won’t have the time or the resources to realize they have been dealt a bad hand. The top 1 percent doesn’t want Americans to be any more educated then to have the ability to help operate and patronize their business’. 
The global elite have a system in place which allows them to grow their global banking empire. All of humanity are literally slaves to the economic system. Money is necessary for our survival in the real world today. Most people will spend the majority of their time working just to survive in the system. If money is the god of our time, that makes Rothschild his prophet. Public School programs worldwide are where the global elite first begin to shape our minds. They continue the shaping through the media. We are taught what they want us to know and nothing more. 
The rich continue to get richer by purchasing up many successful smaller businesses. When the top 1 percent owns the majority of banks, resources and even our governments, it means big problems for the people. The Rothschilds’ are worth over $500 trillion and they are just 1 of 13 families that pretty much collectively own the world. The Rothschilds’ alone could pay off the US national debt 26 times over. Unfortunately they would never do such a thing because they own the majority of the world’s central banks. The New World Order’s agenda is slowly taking small steps toward complete and definitive enslavement through use of the monetary system and ownership of resources.

Doctors prescribe deadly opioid for pain-related issues that aren’t even legal,"Doctors prescribe deadly opioid for pain-related issues that aren’t even legal share in: Big Pharma , FDA , Harmful medicine , Health , medical marijuana , Pharmaceutical Drug Addiction 
Corruption. Bribery. Death. All three are examined in various news reports on a little known “specialty pharmaceutical company” called Insys Theraputics. They are currently under legal fire for Subsys, a controversial sublingual spray that disperses fentanyl, a very fast acting opioid that is “80 times more potent than morphine.” The under the tongue delivery allows the fentanyl to bypass the gastrointestinal system and deliver the opioid directly into the blood stream. The Federal Drug Administration (FDA) has ruled that Subsys can only be prescribed to help cancer patients gain relief from “sudden spikes of excruciating pain.” 
Sarah Fuller was a 32 year old woman who suffered from anxiety and fibromyalgia . She didn’t have cancer. But that didn’t stop her doctor from prescribing Subsys for her aches and pains. The fentanyl acted quickly with Sarah’s already prescribed Xanax, a benzodiazepine. She died. Her family is suing the manufacturer. But why did Sarah’s doctor prescribe a drug that wasn’t approved? That’s easy to answer. Just follow the money. 
As Stat reports, the sales of Subsys grew to $331 million precisely because physicians give it to patients that don’t have cancer, like Sarah Fuller. Doctors get big dollars to simply talk about the drug over dinner, or lunch. Over $6 million dollars have been paid to doctors and health practitioners for this word of mouth activity. 
Take the example of nurse practitioner Heather Alfonso from Illinois. She was paid $83,000 to “go to dinner with a few people,” and in response, prescribed $1.6 million dollars of Subsys scripts to patients that weren’t suffering with cancer pain. She didn’t contest the allegations against her. 
Getting paid to speak isn’t automatically a bribe, but it appears to be a consistent theme when it comes to Susbys marketing methods. Alabama prosecutors built a case against Nancy Reed Perhacs, who used to be a sales representative for Insys Theraputics. Ms. Perhacs coordinated speaking fees for a doctor friend, provided he prescribed Subsys. Her take was $700,000. Other investigations about similar practices are ongoing in Kansas, Rhode Island, New York, Oregon, Michigan, Florida and New Hampshire. 
The chief executive, founder and chairman of Insys Theraputics is billionaire John Kapoor. He’s been around the block with other controversial pharmaceutical start ups. Kapoor thinks doctors are “all ethical.” His new FDA approved drug is a chemically created synthetic tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) called Syndros. As states legalize the real medicine in cannabis , THC and CBD oil , this is an important pharmaceutical to boycott.

NYT credibility DESTROYED by 7 simple questions from Newt Gingrich,"NYT credibility DESTROYED by 7 simple questions from Newt Gingrich share in: Editorials , Journalism , Trump 
The New York Times publisher and executive editor have promised to rededicate the paper to its fundamental mission — to report America and the world honestly, without favors and fear. The paper claims they will strive to understand and reflect all political perspectives and life experiences in stories brought to the public. This announcement is almost considered an apology to its readers for providing a year and a half of unbalanced and unhinged coverage of the presidential race. 
Sean Hannity suggests that Trump must ignore the media and trust his gut instincts. He was sad to see the 165-year-old paper destroy their credibility over the election season. It was obvious to dedicated readers that the Times had abandoned its old coverage standards. Stories were unrelentingly hostile towards Trump and his supporters. Reporters were including their personal opinions and political analysis in the news coverage. This allowed animosity toward Trump to be spread all over social media by political reporters. Front page stories on The New York Times were accusing Trump of lying, but the paper never published the same findings in reference to Hillary Clinton . The paper’s liberal readership has even gotten tired of reporting that resembles state controlled propaganda of totalitarian regimes. Newt Gingrich destroys the New York Times credibility with seven simple questions. 
The New York Times has struggled mightily to answer some serious questions posed by the former United States House of Representatives speaker. Gingrich, a Republican, has asked the times whether they have any reporters, editors or columnists that will say they voted for Trump. He elaborated to ask if they have since hired any Trump supporters to work those positions for the Times. The paper struggled to say whether or not it has hired any Republican reporters at all. 
Gingrich has also asked if the New York Times has changed its policies allowing journalists to express their opinions about events and people they are covering. The fourth question asked by Gingrich wondered if the Times reporters would surrender any Pulitzer Prizes awarded for news stories containing personal opinions. Here are the final questions that the Times struggled to address. “Have its editors retracted misleading news headlines that expressed opinions — such as the paper’s coverage of Trump’s tax returns?” “Has it fired reporters who admitted to writing politically motivated ‘news’ stories and encouraged interview subjects to talk to them so they could stop Trump?” “Has it retracted its shameful election-eve front-page story ‘reporting’ on Trump’s innermost thoughts and feelings, virtually every sentence of which is filled with reporters’ opinions and speculations–featuring claims like ‘he is struggling to suppress his bottomless need for attention”

Destruction of Walk Of Fame star leaves Donald Trump down to his last six Horcruxes,"Thursday 27 October 2016 by Davywavy Destruction of Walk Of Fame star leaves Donald Trump down to his last six Horcruxes 
Stabbing a copy of The Art Of The Deal with a Basilisk’s tooth is the next step to eliminating Donald Trump, according to experts this morning. 
Donald Trump howled in agony and demanded a flask of serpent’s milk to help him recover some strength after the destruction of his first Horcrux on Hollywood’s Walk of Fame yesterday. 
Trump, whose unusually-styled hair is believed to hide a face on the back of his head, is understood to have concealed fragments of his soul in multiple receptacles in an attempt to protect himself from defeat in the forthcoming election. 
Fragments are believed to be hidden in places as diverse as the fabric of Trump Tower, a pussy he grabbed without warning in 2003, and Mike Pence’s unnaturally shining white head of hair. 
The last Horcrux is believed to be the one national poll which has shown him in the lead. If destroyed, this would cause his organisation to fail and his acolytes, known as the Debt Eaters for their habit of bankruptcy, to disband. 
“The Orange Lord is not concerned by this petty attack,” said a spokesman for the Trump campaign. 
“Only a cowardly child would act like this, and Donald challenges his attacker to meet him in debate where he shall win, and win, and win again.” 
To show he meant business, Trump took off his jacket and rolled up his sleeves to threaten anyone who would wish him harm. 
However when Trump handed his jacket to his spokesman to hold, the spokesman cried ‘Dobby’s Free!’, and vanished. Get the best NewsThump stories in your mailbox every Friday, for FREE! There are currently ",1
UK becomes world’s leading exporter of arseholes,"Monday 31 October 2016 by Jack Marshall UK becomes world’s leading exporter of arseholes 
The economy received an unexpected boost today after the Government announced that the UK had become the world’s leading exporter of arseholes. 
“Brexit reminded everyone that Britain is jam-packed with arseholes,” said Simon Williams, a Government spokesman. 
“In the months since the UK decided to leave the EU, our biggest arseholes – titans like Morgan, Hopkins and Milo – have been spouting their ill-informed and profoundly stupid opinions right across the globe. They’ve done wonders for our brand on the international stage.” 
Mr Williams added, “Statistically, when someone in the world asks ‘what kind of arsehole would say that?’, there’s now a 68% probability that the arsehole they’re referring to will be British. 
“We can’t rest on our laurels, though; it’s a very competitive market,” warned Williams. 
“Trump. Putin. Bieber. The world’s chock full of arseholes at the moment.” 
To help keep the UK on top, Mr Williams announced that Nigel Farage will become the UK’s ‘Arsehole Tsar’. 
This will involve Mr Farage travelling around the globe on a lavishly refurbished Royal Yacht Britannia, visiting dozens of different countries and reminding them why Britain is an international laughing stock. 
Looking to the future, Mr Williams was optimistic. 
“Twitter, Facebook and The Mail Online’s comments section are busy producing the UK’s next generation of opinionated morons. 
“With a little luck, we’ll continue to create the kind of exceptional arsehole that can confidently retweet a racist meme or ‘like’ a Britain First article.” Have you checked the standings in the Arsehole Premier League ?

Not much more is known regarding the statement, although some are speculating that it may have something to do with some kind of earthquake that happened in America last night. 
It is unknown if the earthquake was literal or simply a clumsy metaphor from a lazy satirist. 
“Ooh Fuck,” confirmed Democrat party spokesperson, Jay Cooper. 
“That’s all I have to say on the matter. I think it’s fairly conclusive. 
“You can direct any other questions to my secretary. I have several lines of coke to attend to.” 
“Ooh fuck,” verified Cooper’s secretary, Elizabeth King. 
“This is going to require a lot of alcohol and a fair few enquiries to the Canadian passport office- forgive me, I have said too much. Excuse me, I need to leave the room immediately.” 
Americans nationwide were either weeping while exclaiming “Ooh Fuck” or, in some cases, whooping and hollering and high-fiving while cheerfully exclaiming “Ooh Fuck!” 
A bleary-eyed Donald Trump reportedly awoke from his slumber this morning, remembered what happened last night and exclaimed “Ooh Fuck”; presumably having been hit with full magnitude of some kind of job that lay before him.

Vladimir Putin declares victory in US Presidential elections,"Wednesday 9 November 2016 by Davywavy Vladimir Putin declares victory in US Presidential elections 
Vladimir Putin has been elected the 45th President of the United Stares after a stunning victory last night. 
Putin, who was a surprise contender when he entered the race last year, consistently outperformed expectations outpolling all challengers and besting his competition in debates. 
Putin has announced that he will run the United States through a proxy as he is much too busy running the far more important country of Russia. 
In a shock victory, American voters showed they were prepared to overlook Putin’s history of running the KGB in favour of his perceived strong leadership and no-nonsense attitude. 
Doubts over his economic record were also waved aside, with uncomfortable facts such as Russian GDP halving in the last three years being dismissed as scaremongering. 
“You fellow Americans,” said Putin in his acceptance speech. 
“I have so many people to thank for my victory; Edward Snowden, Julian Assange, Bradley Manning, but not least of all the Democratic Party, who put up the only candidate even I could beat. 
“Oh, and I mustn’t forget to congratulate myself too for putting the whole thing together.

Millions of American voters are still stuck as to which piece of shit they should plump for.

“I just can’t decide,” said American fence-sitter, Simon Williams. 
“One of the turds has an okayish record in public office but did some fairly dodgy stuff regarding emails, and the other turd represents the frustrations of the people but is also in the habit of wiping itself on women. 
“I’m stuck between a rock and a hard place or, more literally, one turd and another turd.” 
Fellow voter, Elizabeth King, said, “I’m concerned about the effect that each turd will have on America’s relationship with Russia. 
“One of the turds wants to essentially merge with Russia’s shiniest turd in order to make some kind of mega-bastard-turd, and the other turd wants to put on some kind of firework display where it and Russia essentially fight each other until they blow up the earth.

Global markets turn red as Toblerone scandal unfolds,"Tuesday 8 November 2016 by Davywavy and Hubon Global markets turn red as Toblerone scandal unfolds 
Markets worldwide have opened down this morning after news of the redesign of Toblerone broke overnight. 
Concerns about the redesign weighed heavily on global markets causing a drop of almost 1% in early trading, with major indices in London, New York and Germany coming sharply off Monday’s highs. 
The Bank of England and the US Federal Reserve both rushed to reassure markets with statements confirming that interest rate hikes were ‘off the table’ until stability had been reestablished and the bar had the correct number of triangles again. 
Meanwhile, reports from Europe indicate that several countries have mobilised troops to mass on the Swiss border as international tensions were heightened by the change, with the United States ‘exploring options’ of how to send an aircraft carrier to the landlocked country. 
“This provocative move by the Swiss is completely at odds with both international treaty and law,” said Germany Armed Forces spokesman Simon Wilhelms. 
“If we don’t get a sensible number of triangles back pronto we’re going in shooting.” 
The Swiss National Bank is accused of stockpiling old-style bars before the announcement in order to capitalise upon demand after the fact. 
Mark Carney, Governor of the Bank of England made an unprecedented intervention in the row, saying that Switzerland’s actions were completely unreasonable now that the pound has reached parity with the chocolate coin.

Just weeks after appearing in public with a fuller figure, the new slender Toblerone has stunned fans and journalists alike, to the point of being almost unrecognisable.

America thick as pig shit,"Wednesday 9 November 2016 by Gary Stanton America thick as pig shit 
The American electorate is as thick as fucking pig shit, it has been confirmed this morning. 
When voters were asked to choose between lots and lots of pain and slightly less pain, a majority asked if they could have the options explained again more slowly. 
The night ended with red faces in the Democrat camp and Meryl Streep refusing to get down from the roof of a multi-storey car park in Washington. 
Wildly inaccurate polls that preceded the vote were explained when computer-illiterate pollsters admitted to adding things up on their fingers. 
Political analyst, Chuck Williams, told us, “Even an amoeba is able to respond to an unpleasant stimulus such as Trump’s opinions on immigrants and women by adopting a worried face and scurrying away in the opposite direction. 
“However, if you take the metaphorical amoeba that is the American voting public and repeat the same repulsive codswallop, it just sits there with a big stupid grin all over its rudimentary face. 
“In some cases, it even moves closer.” 
Williams blames what he calls the Fifty Shades effect, insisting the American public are either stupid or masochistic or both. 
He added, “The American public has just voted to be fucked in the ass by a sociopathic narcissist, and it seems that like a badly written fanfic character, they actually wanted it.” Get the best NewsThump stories in your mailbox every Friday, for FREE! There are currently ",1
‘Million Judge March’ to descend on home of Nigel Farage,"Tuesday 8 November 2016 by Danny Soz ‘Million Judge March’ to descend on home of Nigel Farage 
Hundreds of thousands of judges will march to the home of Nigel Farage this weekend in protest against his attempts to subvert the constitution of the nation. 
Britain’s senior judiciary hit back at criticism from UKIP leader, Nigel Farage, by announcing that they will march en masse to his home in Surrey where they will stage a peaceful sit-down protest. 
The march will be led by, The Lord Chief Justice, Lord Thomas of Cwmgiedd, who issued a statement last night, telling reporters, “The members of the judiciary of this country take great exception when minor political figures like Mr Farage make disparaging statements about our judgements and bring our integrity into question. 
“Therefore, myself, along with every judge in the land, will march to Mr Farage’s place of residence on Saturday to give him a little reminder of what we represent and of the sovereignty of British law.” 
A heavy police presence is expected at the march and also at the rallying point, where extensive searches will be carried out for concealed weapons and bottles of gin. Get the best NewsThump stories in your mailbox every Friday, for FREE! There are currently ",1
Marks and Spencer to turn High Street stores into Bingo Halls,"Tuesday 8 November 2016 by Fat Jim Marks and Spencer to turn High Street stores into Bingo Halls 
Marks and Spencer have announced it will convert all clothing and home shops to highly profitable bingo halls and high stake slot machine centres. 
The struggling retailer announced its turnaround plan as it seeks to address the changing needs of British customers. 
The move will also see an end to low-cost child labour exploitation as the company can now exploit an entirely new and untapped demographic, right here in this country. 
The retailer’s main customer base was found to be the over 60’s, many with a walking frame or one of those upright shopping bags with wheels. This core support still likes M&S, but only because they have lost most of their faculties and are not in a position to realise how awful it has become. 
M&S retail executive, Simon Williams, told us, “I looked at these customers of ours and thought ‘Bingo’, we already have a captive audience of people that want to throw their pensions away on unachievable lifestyle marketing – it’s the logical next step.” 
Chief Executive Steven Roe said, “We thought the British public wanted moderately affordable clothing in classic styles, but it turns out they actually want to throw their money into betting machines and to pay extortionate amounts for the thrill of ticking numbers off on a piece of paper. 
“If the referendum taught us anything, it’s that when the people speak, we must listen.” Get the best NewsThump stories in your mailbox every Friday, for FREE! There are currently witterings below - why not add your own? ",1
School to update PE lessons with introduction of cage fighting,"Tuesday 1 November 2016 by James W School to trial cage fighting 
As the Government drops its plans to turn all UK schools into academies, Lonchester High School in Hull pledges to continue offering a curriculum that is relevant to the world beyond the school gates. 
“This year we are trialling ultimate style cage fighting for our year 7s,” says head teacher Adam Smarts. 
With a reputation for his progressive approach, Smarts views the move as a necessary change to outdated school sports with questionable role models. 
“Cage fighting is current, the kids no longer have posters on their walls of football players or pop stars; nowadays it’s all about mixed martial arts.” 
At a recent parents evening, Smarts introduced the idea as part of a suite of new initiatives to better prepare the kids for their lives ahead. 
“Mr Smarts is right,” says Kevin Chalmers, father of 11-year old Toby who begins Year 7 in the autumn. 
“It’s a mucked-up world out there and we need to toughen them up…I don’t want my son prancing around outside when he can be locked in an enclosed space fighting for his life…for me it’s a no brainer.” 
Other parents at the school agree and have wholeheartedly backed Smarts and his team. 
“Within a week, we’d had 96% of permission slips back and orders for kid-sized fighting gloves. 
“Of course safety is important, so our cages have been ratified by the Ultimate Fighting Championship and we always ensure that blood spillage is cleaned up thoroughly between bouts.” 
Bullying has been virtually eradicated at the school courtesy of the inaugural teachers versus pupils fight-night. 
“The usual troublemakers are either traumatised or incapacitated, so the playground is a much friendlier place.” 
Smarts concedes that his ideas are not to everyone’s tastes but insists the results speak for themselves. 
“We’ve even saved some money by selling the now redundant sports field for much-needed housing and the occasional death in the arena has helped to keep class sizes manageable.” 
Smarts hand-picked team are fully invested in the approach and are keen to quash any residual parental scepticism. 
“Come sports day, if anyone still has questions, we’ll get them in the cage, have a good scrap and I’m sure they’ll soon see the benefit…it’ll certainly make a fun change to the usual egg and spoon race,” says head of tactics and geography, Julian Titlow. 
Spring term will see Lonchester broadening its extra-curricular options further to include dog fighting and an after school club version of The Hunger Games, with plans to combine the two as an end of year treat for leavers.

Penguins and Baby Iguana ‘will not follow Planet Earth 2 to Channel Four’,"Monday 7 November 2016 by Alex Marsh Penguins and Baby Iguana ‘will not follow Planet Earth 2 to Channel Four’ 
Channel Four’s plans to build on the success of ‘Planet Earth 2’ have been dealt a blow with the announcement that penguins and baby iguanas will not be leaving the BBC for the commercial channel. 
“The BBC have been good to us over the years,” said an iguana. 
“We’ve built up good relationships, and are keen to explore other projects with them; perhaps a gardening show.” 
In a concise statement, the penguins simply announced that they had decided not to ‘follow the fish’. 
Scuttling land crabs to transfer 
The decision by the penguins and baby iguanas leaves weird scuttling land crabs as the only creature to have committed to Channel Four. 
Agents for creepy leaping snakes and icky acid-squirting ants said that their clients had been approached to fill the void, but had so far reached no agreement with the channel.

America gives Grand Piano to horse,"Wednesday 9 November 2016 by Lucas Wilde America gives Grand Piano to horse 
America has given a grand piano to a horse and is expecting some quality tunes. 
“I’m particularly looking forward to Beethoven’s Ninth,” beamed horse supporter and piano enthusiast, Jay Cooper. 
“A horse has never been given a piano before because, frankly, the establishment wouldn’t allow it. 
“Now, at last, change has come, and America will change for the better. 
“There are a lot of doubters out there, and those doubters will soon be silenced by the graceful notes of Chopin, Mozart and maybe even Little Richard.” 
Horse, Dobbin Williams, said, “I’m not really sure what’s expected of me here. 
“I’m a horse. I am absolutely not qualified to play a piano. 
“I mean… Look at these hooves and the way I am in general. I can’t even sit on the chair properly. 
“Why on earth did anyone think this was a good idea?” 
Cooper grinned, “We did it. We’ve made pianos great again.” 
Democrat, Elizabeth King, said “We wanted to get a pianist of low-to-medium standard for the piano. 
“She wouldn’t have thumped out anything exciting, but it would have been perfectly reasonable background music. 
“But the people have spoken, and the people wanted a horse.

"This is what happens when you don’t have the Queen, Canada tells America","Wednesday 9 November 2016 by Davywavy This is what happens when you don’t have the Queen, Canada tells America 
Canada has given a sad shake of its head and observed that this is what happens when you don’t have the Queen today. 
Browsing the news over its breakfast of bacon, bacon and bacon, Canada met news from The USA with a mixture of incomprehension and pity. 
Meanwhile, office conversations around baconcoolers across the country have been held in hushed, horrified tones about the fate which has befallen their neighbour to the south. 
“I just called into Tim Hortons for a cup of bacon decaf and a bacon donut when I heard the news from America,” said Canadian Simoon Williams. 
“Those poor, poor people. If only they’d kept the Queen as head of state, they’d have avoided all of this.

United States of America continues to dominate baseball World Series,"Thursday 3 November 2016 by Danny Soz United States of America continues to dominate baseball World Series 
The all-conquering Americans last night tightened their grip on the baseball World Series, leaving 195 other countries trailing in their wake. 
This time it was the turn of the Chicago Cubs to reinforce America’s total domination of the series by beating the Cleveland Indians 8-7 on a thrilling night for their millions of fans worldwide. 
Since it’s inception in 1903, no other country has come close to the world title as the American baseball juggernaut has rumbled over all-comers. 
One of the first to congratulate the triumphant American team was presidential hopeful, Donald Trump, who spoke to reporters from Florida where he is currently on the campaign trail. 
Forming an “o” with his thumb and forefinger and moving his hand up and down, Trump told reporters: “This is a tremendous win for America. It’s just tremendous. 
“In fact, if I were to try to tell you how tremendous this is, you wouldn’t believe me. Under my presidency, this sort of tremendous event would be happening all the time. 
“You would all be so proud. So proud. So proud of me and proud of your country. I can’t tell you how proud you would be because you wouldn’t believe me. 
“However, under Hillary, none of these tremendous achievements would happen. Hillary is a crook who belongs in jail. She is not tremendous, and I will jail her. Jail…is…where…she…belongs!” 
The triumphant Cubs team will now embark on a world tour of Illinois to celebrate their remarkable world-beating achievement. Get the best NewsThump stories in your mailbox every Friday, for FREE! There are currently ",1
Chicago Cubs go 24 hours without winning a World Series,"Thursday 3 November 2016 Chicago Cubs go 24 hours without winning a World Series 
Fans are blaming ‘some kind of curse’ for the Cubs’ failure to win a single World Series since yesterday. 
The team, which has now not won a Series in as long as many of their severely drunken, staggering fans can remember, is worried that their failure to buy some lucky white heather from a mysterious gypsy who called at Wrigley Field in the early hours of this morning has in some way jinxed their success. 
Infielder Chris Bryant, who answered the door to the peculiar crone, reported that he told her he felt they’d got enough good luck already – and then the witch told him ‘A curse be on this place and all within!’ before vanishing in a cloud of stale, brimstone-scented smoke. 
“And we’ve not won a World Series since,” he concluded in a worried tone. “What have I wrought upon the club?” 
Board chairman Thomas Ricketts has apologised to the people of Chicago for the lack of trophies in the last day, but pledged he was doing his hardest to bring ‘some kind, any kind’ of award to the city to placate concerned supporters. 
When told of the club’s failure to bring home any silverware in almost 24 hours, fan Simon Williams looked up groggily and replied “What? Uh, oh God, here we go again.

Americans given historic opportunity to tell Donald Trump to go fuck himself,"Tuesday 8 November 2016 by Gary Stanton Americans given historic opportunity to tell Donald Trump to go fuck himself 
Americans are today being given a once in a lifetime opportunity to tell Donald Trump to go fuck himself. 
According to experts, today’s vote is less an opportunity to select the leader of the free world, so much as the chance to remind Donald Trump what an arsehole they all think he is. 
Democratic countries around the globe are today united in telling Americans they have a unique chance to show the world that they have the ability to guide a leading nation in the direction of societal harmony, equality for all, and telling racists to go fuck themselves. 
US political expert, Chuck Williams, told us, “Setting the persuasive policy arguments made by the candidates to one side, the United States will wake on Wednesday morning to either of two plausible realities. 
“One in which the downcast misogynist billionaire leader has been roundly told to fuck the fuck off, or another in which he enjoys a prolonged, ill-tempered orgasm on the Fox News network.” 
Williams urged Americans to imagine a forward-looking country in which Donald Trump isn’t constantly forced to appear on the news in order to defend himself against accusation after inevitable accusation of improper behaviour, both privately and professionally. 
He concluded, “You can either offer a number of quiet ‘fuck you’s at him many, many times over the next four years, or you can give him one enormous one today.

Jeremy Vine already tripping his tits off,"Tuesday 8 November 2016 by Lucas Wilde Jeremy Vine already tripping his tits off 
Veteran election reporter Jeremy Vine has embarked on his usual pre-election broadcast ritual by taking a load of drugs and hallucinating maps of the USA, pie-charts and various other election-themed visages. 
The least-funny of the Vine brothers usually waits until the polls close before cracking open his thermos flask full of hallucinogens, but has decided to get on it early this year. 
“I can’t say I blame him” said Lucy Millwall, Head of CGI for BBC News. 
“This election has been impressive only for sheer scale of mind-numbing awfulness. 
“Honestly, you try pretending to give a shit about what Gary Johnson is up to without yawning. 
“It’s actually intriguing watching him dance around an empty green room, imagining he’s kicking a football marked “Florida” between Trump and Clinton. 
“We just computer-generate images around whatever he’s imagining. Technically we are ‘enabling’ him but fuck it; it’s really good telly. 
“We’re always careful to cut away from him before he starts talking to Peter, the ‘Rapiest Giraffe of Them All’.” Jeremy Vine election coverage 
Jeremy Vine has been taking LSD ever since John Major’s first election victory; the campaign proving so overwhelmingly dull that recreational drug use became BBC protocol for several weeks. 
Vine is thought to be the only one to keep this up, apart from the Chuckle Brothers, who owe their youthful energy to a vigorous cocaine regimen. 
After ballot day, it is thought that Vine will commence the mother of all comedowns, which should wear off just before his next pre-election bender for a Brexit-inspired snap election sometime next month. Get the best NewsThump stories in your mailbox every Friday, for FREE! There are currently ",1
NewsThump declared an Enemy of the People,"Friday 4 November 2016 by Davywavy NewsThump declared an Enemy of the People 
Treasonous lickspittle “comedy” website NewsThump has been declared an Enemy of the People today after expressing a general preference for the supremacy of Parliament. 
The site, which was run by a cabal of international financiers, homosexuals and fencers from a light industrial estate just outside Kettering, treacherously suggested that a system of checks and balances within a Democracy was a pretty good idea and were immediately denounced by popular tribunes for their sedition. 
Contributors to the site have been accused of supporting foreign interests, including buying expensive continental lagers in preference to Carling. 
Managing Editor, Simon Williams, has been taken into custody and will be tried and hanged – because it’s important to have a trial even when the outcome isn’t in doubt. 
A new editor has been democratically elected and will only run popular comedy stories, including the hilarious ‘Purge Parliament of Perfidy!’, “Buy British-made jams to further strengthen our economic progress!”, and “Let us thoroughly implement our Party’s policy of putting all the people under arms and turning the whole country into a fortress!”, which Kim Jong-Un has given his generous permission to use. 
Speaking to reporters from loyal publications, a spokesman for The People explained that ‘The so-called law’ was merely ‘advisory’ and should be set aside at times when more important considerations over-ruled it. 
“Yes, yes, Britain has a ‘constitution’ and ‘laws’ and ‘checks and balances’, but these are outdated, petty ideas from a less civilised time; a barbaric holdover from the past,” he explained. 
“From now on we’ll just hold a vote on everything people want. There’s going to be one on Tuesday about everyone getting a pony. 
“And if I’ve not got my free pony by Friday, heads will roll, let me tell you.” ",1
"If you think our media is racist, wait till you meet my grandfather, Prince Harry tells Meghan Markle","Radio Tuesday 8 November 2016 by Spacey If you think our media is racist, wait till you meet my grandfather, Prince Harry tells Meghan Markle 
After calling out media ‘racism’ over coverage of his girlfriend, Prince Harry has warned Meghan Markle to brace herself for a meeting with Prince Philip. 
The prince released a statement in which he said reporting of his relationship with the American actress had ‘crossed a line’ that was similar to suggesting you’ll get slitty eyes if you spend too long in China. 
He went on to add that he understands there is curiosity about his private life, but he’s developed a tough skin that’s capable of dealing with an elderly gentleman asking if you work in a strip club. 
The statement also raised concerns about Ms Markle’s safety after receiving anonymous warnings that some foreigners ‘still throw spears at each other’. 
Prince Philip has revealed that he is looking forward to meeting his grandson’s new girlfriend.

West Ham fans laud aerodynamic properties of new pound coin,"Tuesday 1 November 2016 by Formelia Alberthine West Ham fans laud aerodynamic properties of new pound coin 
West Ham fans have thanked the Royal Mint for its efforts in improving the match-day experience at the London Stadium with the release of a new more aerodynamic pound coin. 
Many season ticket holders claim its enhanced aerodynamic design, could see its distance and accuracy improve significantly. 
A Royal Mint spokesperson explained, “There is a reason golf balls aren’t completely flat, these imperfections on the surface actually reward the more skilful throwers. You’re welcome.” 
After a spate of crowd disturbances at the ground, Hammers fans had complained of a return to the dark days of the early eighties, where only ‘unpredictable’ circular coins could be deployed as missiles at games. 
West Ham fan Simon Williams congratulated the Royal Mint on the technological advances which have seen multiple ‘stabilising’ edges introduced. 
He told us, “I’m reasonably confident that with this new coin I could pick out the skull of an opposition player, or supporter for that matter, from way up in the gods. 
“They’re quite weighty – I had become accustomed to launching 20p’s, but they only leave flesh wounds – these babies could do serious brain damage. 
“Obviously it’s difficult to inflict brain damage upon Millwall fans, but it will be fun trying! 
West Ham vice-chair Karen Brady hoped the temptation to start launching whole pounds could see match day takings increase significantly. 
“Listen, if they want to start targeting the directors’ seats then please, by all means, do so. 
“In fact, I’d like to see all denominations of our fabled currency ‘go coin’.

Daily Mail forced to lie down in darkened room after confirmation Prince Harry’s girlfriend is mixed-race,"Tuesday 8 November 2016 Daily Mail forced to lie down in darkened room after confirmation Prince Harry’s girlfriend is mixed-race 
The Daily Mail has been forced to go and lie down in a darkened room for a while after learning that Prince Harry’s new girlfriend is one of those ‘brown ones’. 
Doctors were called after the newspaper reported feeling faint at reading the Kensington Palace statement confirming the relationship. 
The Daily Mail explained, “I know we’ve been reporting the relationship for days, but we’d hoped against hope it wasn’t really true. 
“Sure, we’ve trawled her entire career and social feeds going back years to find video clips and photos that might make her look unsuitable as a girlfriend for a member of our royal family, all without ever saying it’s just because she’s a brown foreigner – but you kinda knew that, right? 
“I mean, we can’t just say we don’t like her because she’s brown and foreign. Otherwise, we’d probably find our editor Paul Dacre being reported to himself in his other role at the Press Complaints Commission. That wouldn’t be good for anyone. 
“But now it’s bloody well confirmed she’s definitely going out with him, and.. well… oh hear, I’m coming over all faint again. 
“Do you realise that any child they might have would be 6th in line to the throne?! Can you imagine, a BROWN king!!”

"£100k in used notes might make poppies less political, say FIFA","Wednesday 2 November 2016 by Neil Tollfree €100k in used notes might make poppies less political, say FIFA 
Fifa has indicated that the row over England and Scotland players wearing poppies on their kit could be ended in recompense for a ‘gift’ of €100,000 in untraceable used bank notes. 
“FIFA is committed to a new era without corruption,” said FIFA head Gianni ‘Razors’ Infantino. 
“As such, we would never suggest any sort of bribe. However, if these guys, these British Legion guys, if they were to offer a small financial gesture of friendship, then perhaps we would be able to forget the political implications of wearing a symbol of remembrance and the whole situation could be resolved without any need for…unpleasantness.” 
The row began after FIFA refused permission for the England and Scotland players to wear a poppy symbol on their shirts because, unlike the Nike or Puma logos, there is literally no money in it. 
“I looked into it,” continued Don Infantino. 
“These poppy guys brought in over a mil last year, and that’s pure untaxed profit. Now we ain’t asking for much over here, just a taste is all. A gesture. But in Euros, none of that worthless Sterling rubbish. 
Although negotiations are currently amicable, there were indications that things could become less so. 
“Hey, we’re all friends here but if, you know, if we can’t all get along,” said Mr Infantino with a smile that didn’t quite reach his eyes.

People on benefits receive award for outstanding contribution to Channel 5’s schedule,"Friday 4 November 2016 by Spacey People on benefits receive award for outstanding contribution to Channel 5’s schedule 
Benefit claimants have defied critics who say they don’t contribute anything by receiving an award for their outstanding contribution to Channel 5’s TV schedule. 
Editor of What Scapegoat? magazine Simon Williams presented the award at an arsehole-studded event in London yesterday evening. 
“What better way to unwind after a hard day at work than by getting angry because an overweight man on benefits has a pet cat and a dirty fridge,” he said. 
“Why get worked up about tax avoidance on a massive scale when you can experience the fury of watching a work-shy teenager playing Call of Duty on his Xbox?” 
Iain Duncan Smith, who accepted the award on behalf of benefit claimants, said: “Creating the impression that everyone on benefits is undergoing plastic surgery in a bid to become a glamour model has been invaluable in gathering support for welfare cuts. 
“When people think of benefits claimants, it’s important they don’t think I, Daniel Blake , but that they think iPhone and iPad.

The earthworm is expected to join Harambe in Valhalla where they will toast their valour for all eternity. 
Dave the giant worm died in battle against scientists trying to measure him and is to receive a fiery, viking funeral in a longship specially constructed for the occasion. 
Thor, God of Thunder, has expressed disappointment that he did not defeat Dave himself as he had hoped to practice on the worm in preparation for battle against Jormungandr, the Midgard Serpent, at the end of all things.

“Then we shall cast the ship adrift in the still, wine-dark sea before sending him aloft with the wormy Valkyrie by firing burning arrows at him until he is utterly consumed by flames and the waves, God rest him.”

Facebook user wastes two hours sharing things to impress his insurance company,"Wednesday 2 November 2016 Facebook user wastes two hours sharing things to impress his insurance company 
Facebook user Simon Williams has admitted he only shares things on social media to impress other people, so trying to impress his insurance company seemed like a sensible thing to do. 
Williams said Admiral Insurance’s decision to offer better insurance deals to people with Facebook profiles that looked ‘safer’ to their quotation algorithm had led to an afternoon of frantic social activity. 
He explained, “Obviously, as a millennial social media user, I only ever share things that will impress my friends, future employers and potentially those women who happen across my Facebook profile from any of the number of dating apps I use. 
“So sharing and posting things purely to make myself look better is nothing new to me. Tweaking that for an insurance company was pretty easy. 
“I simply liked a number of Facebook pages about driver safety, signed a petition calling for lower speed limits on UK roads, added a couple of driving safety courses as Life Events, and even put a couple of posts on my historic timeline about how people are ‘driving way too fast past the school these days’. 
“Also, Driving Miss Daisy is now my favourite film, by the way.

Microsoft has today announced that the next version of their popular email software will include a function that quickly and irretrievably deletes every email on the computer. 
Head of product development Simon Williams announced, “With the FBI investigating Hillary Clinton’s emails, we have recognised the need for a quick one-click button that will instantly remove all emails from your PC. 
“This will be useful if you suddenly find yourself under investigation by the FBI. Or if you’ve had a bit of a flirty email exchange with that girl from accounts who you felt you had a bit of chemistry with, but then you took it a bit too far that one time and now suddenly realise you are in grave danger of being dismissed for sexual harassment. 
“You know, everyday sort of situations.” 
The new Microsoft Office suite is due to be released next year, and Outlook is reportedly not the only software with a Clinton inspired update. 
“We’ve tweaked Internet Explorer a little too,” continued Mr Williams. 
“For those users who routinely forget to use InPrivate Browsing, we will be adding a ‘Bill’ button which with one click will simultaneously close your browsing window and delete all of your search history and cookies. 
“This will protect you from your wife ever knowing that you googled ‘What is Monica Lewinsky up to these days’. 
“Or in the case of a regular user it will prevent your spouse finding out whatever niche, depraved pornography you are into when she unexpectedly returns from a work social an hour early and catches you mid self-pleasure. 
“Again, just normal, everyday situations our customers find themselves in.” 
The button will be adjacent to the Minimize, Maximize and Close icons on the top toolbar, thereby saving the user a frantic search of the menus while pathetically attempting to conceal their erection as their significant other approaches.

Theresa May seeks return of 1542 witchcraft act,"Tuesday 1 November 2016 by Neil Tollfree Theresa May seeks return of 1542 witchcraft act 
Prime Minister Theresa is set to continue her plans to return to the traditions of Great Britain’s past by reintroducing the 1542 Witchcraft act. 
Beginning with the return of Grammar Schools and followed by naked hostility to Europe, the reestablishment of the 1542 Witchcraft act appears to be further sign that a May premiership will not be afraid to lean on this country’s history. 
The witchcraft act will be officially announced in next year’s Queens Speech and will criminalise ‘ Invovacons or conjuracons of Sprites witchecraftes or sorceries .’ 
Mrs May was quick to deny claims that the criminalisation of witchcraft, like Grammar Schools and hostility to Europe were archaic nonsenses that should be consigned to the history books. 
“Rubbish,” said the Prime Minister, interrupting her dinner of Frumenty and Lamphreys and dismissing her court Jester; Boris. 
“I just believe that we are living in uncertain times, and I want to be clear that we will not tolerate the lower orders using devilments and wickedness in order to gain advantage over hard-working families.” 
Mrs May refused to deny claims that she plans to bring in a Witchfinder General and the burning of convicted witches at the stake. 
“It is something that is being looked into,” she confirmed.

A man is signalling his immediate availability to women by flaunting his Warhammer carrier bag today. 
Simon Williams, 34, is brazenly carrying the bag through his town centre in an ostentatious display of naked sexual availability. 
The bag is understood to contain several large plastic robots which reinforce the visual cues of his readiness to mate.

"Martians invade, humanity too embarrassed to take them to our leader","Wednesday 9 November 2016 by Davywavy and H Martians invade, humanity too embarrassed to take them to our leader 
A Martian invasion of Planet Earth was delayed this morning when alien demands to be taken to the leader of the free world were just met with shifty looks and embarrassed silence. 
“It was really weird,” admitted Martian invasion fleet captain Zy-Mon Williams. 
“Normally when we invade a planet, the usual procedure is to park the saucers over the largest and most prosperous-looking nation, beam down, point the blaster at some local and say ‘Take me to your leader’. 
“But this time, for some reason, it’s not working. 
“All the humans we’ve collared so far just seem to look shifty or embarrassed, saying things like ‘my word, is that the time,’ and then run away. 
“Also none of them will look us directly in the eye, they just stare at their feet, whereas normally people always stare at us on account of us being green and stuff.” 
But Williams was optimistic. “Pretty soon we’ll find whoever runs this place,” he declared, “and then Earth is doomed! Bwa ha ha ha ha ha!” 
On hearing this, humanity nodded as if it wasn’t really surprised. Get the best NewsThump stories in your mailbox every Friday, for FREE! There are currently ",1
Washington Home Depot store receives order for five-thousand gallons of gold exterior paint,"Wednesday 9 November 2016 by Pete Redfern Washington Home Depot store receives order for five-thousand gallons of gold exterior paint 
The Washington DC branch of the famous chain of home improvement superstores received an unusual and baffling phone call late last night. 
Store manager Chuck Williams told reporters, “We received a telephone call just before closing last night from a very excited gentleman, placing an order for over $120,000 worth of gold concrete paint.” 
He continued “It was quite a hurried conversation, and I couldn’t catch everything he said, but I did hear the caller say something cryptic about turning a white house gold. 
“I honestly have no idea what he could have meant, perhaps it was a riddle. And weirdly he kept referring to himself in the third person. 
“At first we thought it might have been a hoax or someone out of their head on mind-altering substances, but we have checked our account and the money is already there, so we will start fulfilling the order immediately.” 
When pressed by reporters, Mr Williams was reluctant to give further details for fear of breaching customer confidentiality, but he did confirm that the order was for a residence on Pennsylvania Avenue NW, Washington, D.C 20500. 
He added, “I don’t know who this caller who referred to himself as ‘The Big Cheese’ could be, but he sure loves gold.” Get the best NewsThump stories in your mailbox every Friday, for FREE! There are currently ",1
Man whose job it was to rig US Presidential election fired,"Wednesday 9 November 2016 Man whose job it was to rig US Presidential election fired 
The man whose job it was to rig the election for Hillary Clinton has been fired without a reference this morning. 
53-year-old NWO black ops operative Simon Williams spent the last six months programming voting machines to flip votes, and mailing bundles of blank voting forms to registered Democrats. 
However, his failure to swing the result means he is unlikely to get the fat payoff and pension contributions he had been counting on. 
Williams is also concerned that his lack of a reference to explain how he’s spent the last few years of his life might count against him in the job market, with employers as far afield as Russia, Zimbabwe and Venezuela refusing to accept his word as an expert that he’s good at controlling electoral outcomes. 
Sources inside the Democrat party have highlighted this as just the first American job lost by Trump and warned there could be many more, specifically in the polling and political punditry industries. 
“It’s outrageous,” Simon told us. 
“I heard there was a great role coming up as stage manager for the CIA, but they won’t even talk to me unless my resume contains what I’ve been doing for the last few years. 
“Which is a bit rich coming from them, if I may make so bold. You’d think they of all people would be more understanding. 
“Still, I hear Francois Hollande has an election coming up in France. Does anyone have his number? I’m sure he could use a hand.” Get the best NewsThump stories in your mailbox every Friday, for FREE! There are currently witterings below - why not add your own? ",1

Obi-Wan Kenobi has reported a great disturbance in the Force, as if millions of voices cried out in terror and were suddenly silenced. 
The wise old man felt the disturbance whilst chatting to his young apprentice and felt a sudden need for a sit down, muttering ‘something terrible has happened’. 
Jedi Master Kenobi, who fought with Bail Organa in the Clone Wars, is currently uncertain of the cause of the disturbance but suggests some sort of planet-busting doomsday event may have occurred. 
“I’m hoping it’s just a giant space-laser obliterating an entire civilisation; that’s probably the least-worst possible cause,” he confirmed. 
“Failing that, it’s likely something dark side-y. Some kinda of colossal use of the mind trick, maybe?

Donald Trump, who had his Twitter access revoked by his campaign managers, has successfully secured access to America’s nuclear codes. 
Trump was denied control of his Twitter account in the build-up to the presidential election due to a series of monumentally stupid tweets. 
According to a senior aide, the new president will only regain full control of his Twitter account once he’s proved that he can act responsibly. 
“We’ll give him the nuclear codes, and if he can get through a week without triggering armageddon then we’ll review his Twitter access,” confirmed the senior aide.

Alan Sugar considering his options,"Thursday 10 November 2016 by Neil Tollfree Alan Sugar considering his options 
Following former ‘ The Apprentice ’ host Donald Trump’s triumph in the US Presidential race, current UK ‘ The Apprentice ’ host Alan Sugar is said to be considering his options. 
“I don’t think it had ever occurred to Lord Sugar that running for office would be an option,” said a friend of the business magnate. 
“Largely because, having no political experience or knowledge of what it takes to run a country, it would be an incredibly stupid, terrifying and dangerous idea. 
“However, being a stupid, terrifying and dangerous idea doesn’t seem a barrier to holding high office anymore, so he is giving the option consideration.” 
It seems that Lord Sugar isn’t the only reality star who is considering a political career. 
“Yeah, what I think is that, you know, I might be a Prime Minister and everything,” said terrifyingly breasted ‘author’ Jordan. 
“I mean, I’m a successful businesswoman, and I’ve been on telly a lot, you know, like Mr Trump, so why not?” 
The British people appear to be reacting warmly to the idea. 
“Well, as a voter, I’m obviously colossally f**king stupid,” said Simon Williams.

"Donald Trump to leave America for a younger, sexier country","Thursday 10 November 2016 by Davywavy Donald Trump to leave America for a younger, sexier country 
President-elect Donald Trump has already got a much younger, sexier county lined up to replace America in his affections. 
Concerns have already been raised after Trump demanded America enter into a pre-nup before he takes the oath of office. 
Trump, who has already been accused of screwing Mexico when he thinks he can get away with it, defended his roving eye by saying that ‘any President’ would check out hot, available countries and there was nothing wrong with it. 
Trump’s penchant for ‘exotic’ foreign names is well recorded, and the people of Brunei Darussalam are already concerned after he commented on ‘getting his tongue around their name’. 
Meanwhile, members of NATO and the UN have been told to ‘put out or get out’ in what is being interpreted as a direct demand for favours. 
“Look, if Puerto Rico weren’t a protectorate, I’d already be all over them. If I weren’t already their president and, you know, Is that terrible? Is it?”, he told reporters. 
“And the Russian Republic. Daughter of the Soviet Union, sure, but they’re only 23 years old. And they’re big, voluptuous, you might say. That’s pretty sexy, am I right? 
“I wonder if they’ve got a, you know, opening I might fill.”

John Lewis offers stark warning about cleaning animal faeces from trampolines,"Thursday 10 November 2016 John Lewis offers stark warning about cleaning animal faeces from trampolines 
John Lewis has today launched a public service announcement warning the public of the dangers of young children playing on trampolines covered in animal faeces. 
The two-minute film shows the myriad of filthy animals that can come into contact with your child’s plaything during the night, carrying a wide range of germs and disease. 
A spokesperson for John Lewis explained, “We are all about child safety, but we only had two minutes, which is why we didn’t show the Dad digging the trampoline in properly, per safety protocols. 
“The important threat is the animals and their filth. Badgers can carry TB, did you know that? Do you want your child to get TB? Because not cleaning the trampoline is how your child gets TB. 
“Would you let your daughter play with a dolls house that was covered in fox piss? No, of course you wouldn’t. Well, dirty trampolines are no better. 
Film critic Simon Williams said, “It’s a very powerful film. You see how she stops at the end? That’s because it’s needs cleaning with anti-bacterial wipes to ensure she doesn’t get any animal faeces in her mouth.

Every bigot you’ve ever met is a little bit happier today. 
Donald Trump has won the Presidency in a result that wasn’t fuelled by hatred or racism by everyone, or not even perhaps the majority, but nonetheless a result that absolutely every narrow-minded tosspot was definitely hoping for. 
“Yay!” said racist, Simon Williams. 
“What a great morning to be American – like every morning, obviously, as every other nation is inferior. 
“But this morning is just super-bloody-duper.

Democrats begin search for candidate who knows how to use email,"Wednesday 9 November 2016 Democrats begin search for candidate who knows how to use email 
Officials inside the Democrat party have begun a party-wide search for a candidate who knows how to use email. 
Party strategists have decided that an inability to use email properly has cost them the White House, and that an aptitude for email will be a real vote winner in 2020. 
As one DNC insider explained, “Trump has won the presidential election off the back of our inability to convince the American public we can set up and use a modern email service. 
“If we can just address that one hurdle we can win back the White House in four years time. 
“You wouldn’t happen to know anyone who is good with email, would you? Anyone? 
“I don’t care about their policy objectives, or political views, or their religion – just promise me they know a blind-copy from a reply-all, and we’ll back them all the way.

US to replace national Anthem with the Benny Hill theme,"Wednesday 9 November 2016 by Neil Tollfree US to replace national anthem with the Benny Hill theme 
Following a Donald Trump win in the Presidential election, the US has announced plans to abandon the Star-Spangled Banner as National Anthem in favour of the Benny Hill theme, Yakety Sax . 
“The Star-Spangled Banner is a beautiful old hymn of hope and decency,” explained American historian, Simon Williams, through tears at what his country had become. 
“So now, with a Trump presidency in prospect, the theme to Benny Hill seems tonally more appropriate.” 
The Benny Hill Show, surprisingly popular in the US, featured Benny Hill playing a lecherous and stupid version of himself who would chase after scantily-clad women with hilarious consequences. 
“I think that when President Elect Trump walks up the steps of the Capitol to take the oath of office in January, hearing the strains of the Yakety Sax will give the occasion about the appropriate level of dignity.” 
Other options considered as a new National Anthem include the theme for the Simpsons, Sir Mix-a-lot’s Baby Got Back and, what is understood to be Mr Trump’s choice, Tomorrow Belongs To Me . 
The Benny Hill theme seemed to find favour with many Americans. 
“Yeah, I sure like that,” said Eleanor Gay from Pennsylvania.

With global economies still reeling from the news that Donald Trump will become the leader of the free world, the first silver linings have appeared for the people of Britain. 
A spokesperson for Marmite products told us, “Many of the global commodities in our value chain are traded in dollars, so cheaper dollars means cheaper ingredients, which means cheaper marmite.”

Swansea City are nailed on favourites to be crowned Premier League champions in 2017, it has emerged.

“Public opinion tells us The Swans finish firmly in top spot, with Crystal Palace, Brentford and MK Dons securing the Champions League places,” said lead researcher, Simon Williams. 
“Taylor’s goal tally will obviously be a major factor and we predict around 30 of them will come in a 41-0 rout of Liverpool at Anfield in January.

I even filmed the maintenance people outside, tools in hand, completely immobile. “After filming for a record-breaking twenty-five minutes, I realised I’d forgotten to actually send out the email telling people to prepare for the Mannequin Challenge. “I was the only person in the building doing any activity, even if it was just dicking around because of a YouTube craze. “I’ve never felt so alone; it was like waiting for something I knew wasn’t going to arrive, if you can imagine such a thing.” In the past few weeks, the Internet craze known as the Mannequin Challenge has hit offices and gyms across the UK. Participants must strike a pose in the manner of shop mannequins and then be filmed, giving the impression that a fleeting moment has somehow been captured on film. Why this is considered a challenge or even a good thing is still under debate.

Kanye West rushed to hospital with suspected ‘dislocated ego’,"Tuesday 22 November 2016 by Mark Maguire Kanye West rushed to hospital with suspected ‘dislocated ego’ 
Rap ‘legend’ Kanye West is this evening undergoing emergency treatment for a suspected dislocated ego, suffered while talking to himself in the mirror. 
The self-loving 39-year-old was rushed to hospital after a member of his entourage noticed worrying signs that the usually conceited front-man was not his normal vanity-obsessed self. 
They told reporters, “One minute everything seemed fine, and he was swaggering around the place looking down his nose at all the rest of us, like normal. 
“Then, what seemed like just seconds later, he was stood at the side of the room, shoulders slumped, displaying some frankly worrying signs of genuine humility. 
“I asked him he was OK, but all he could say was, ‘The Life of Pablo – that album is just a load of old self-indulgent horseshit, isn’t it?’. I’m not afraid to admit that at that moment, I was terrified.” 
“It soon became a race to see how quickly we could reach the emergency services and get him some treatment before the ego suffered permanent damage.” 
The star’s support staff reacted swiftly, with an on-site emergency first-aider ensuring Kanye received some much needed mouth-to-ear ego stroking. 
One witness explained, “I think that first-aid saved his ego to be honest – they just seemed to instinctively know how to react, and the right thing to say. Thankfully the paramedics arrived after just a few minutes. 
“They brought all this incredible equipment and spent about fifteen minutes applying emergency ego-massage, while the rest of us just looked on in horror. 
“Fortunately they managed to stabilise him so that they could get him to the hospital, but they continued the ego-massage as they loaded him into the ambulance. 
“The last thing I heard them say was, ‘You’re amazing Kanye, and The College Dropout is the best album of the last twenty years, and that’s absolutely all down to you, and you alone’.” 
Kanye was rushed to a specialist ‘Ego Hospital’ in Beverly Hills and underwent a complex eight-hour surgery to re-locate the ego, which Doctors have declared a complete success. 
A hospital spokesperson confirmed that his recuperation could take up to eight weeks, but that he would likely make a full recovery and should return to his previous levels of brazen egotism.

Queen claims 70 years of Prince Philip is perfect preparation for Donald Trump,"Monday 21 November 2016 by Pete Redfern Queen claims 70 years of Prince Philip is perfect preparation for Donald Trump 
With tradition dictating that the British monarch should be amongst the first to meet a newly elected president, the Queen has assured everyone she knows exactly how to deal with men like that. 
An unnamed source close to the royal family told reporters “She’s basically been living with a Trump-like character for decades, so she knows the level of bloke she’s dealing with. 
“By all accounts both the Duke of Edinburgh and Donald Trump have the same insatiable sexual appetite – you can only imagine how Philip suggested they celebrate their 69th anniversary. Hopeless. 
“And then there’s the racism. She will probably attempt to discuss important matters such as the economy and international relations with Trump, but she just knows he’ll lower the tone of the conversation with racial stereotypes and outdated misogynistic views. 
“You know, like the ones she hears day in, day out from her husband.” 
It is believed that the Queen will brace herself with a few gin and tonics before meeting Trump, in the hope that the effect of the alcohol will be to take her mind off the depressing thought that the strangely coiffed reality TV star could be the last president she knows. 
Her source also added, “Some people have expressed concern about the Queen having a private meeting with a self-confessed sexual predator, but they need not have any worries.

"NHS patients must make cup of tea, name three Madness songs, and drink heavily to prove they’re British","Radio Tuesday 22 November 2016 by Neil Tollfree NHS patients must make cup of tea, name three Madness songs, and drink heavily to prove they’re British 
In new rules to prevent health tourism, all prospective NHS patients will be required to pass a test to prove they’re British, a top Department of Health civil servant has said. 
Simon Williams told a Commons committee that it was a controversial move but it was ‘worth it to keep all those ghastly foreigners out’. 
“The NHS has a terrible problem with awful foreigners deliberately getting cancer so they can come and loll about in great British hospitals eating curry and complaining about how Christmas decorations offend them,” said Mr Williams. 
“Obviously, the preference is to send these sort of people back to wherever they come from so they can die without bothering any decent British chaps.” 
The test for Britishness will take the form of a half-hour written exam and fifteen-minute practical test to be carried out on arrival to any NHS hospital before treatment. 
The exam will include questions on pasties, the films of James Robertson Justice, and a requirement to transcribe the third verse of God Save the Queen. 
The practical will involve making a proper cup of tea and being sexually repressed, before drinking several pints of lager, eating a kebab and mooning a policeman. Get the best NewsThump stories in your mailbox every Friday, for FREE! There are currently ",1

Nigel Farage has said he stands by his claim that the US President should stay out of British affairs , unless of course there is a cushy job lined up for him at the end of it. 
Nigel Farage has told the government that ignoring Donald Trump’s calls for him to be made US Ambassador was putting political dislike above what is best for Nigel Farage. 
The three-time UKIP leader told reporters, “When I said during the referendum campaign that President Obama had no place commenting on the British political process, I of course meant that he had no place disagreeing with me. 
“This new guy though, he agrees with me on lots of things, so now the British government should be listening very closely to the US President-elect, and what he wants. 
“If the US President says I should be Britain’s Ambassador to the US, then it’s the British Government’s job to jump to attention and make it so, regardless of me being the leader of a party in opposition, or disagreeing with the government’s position on just about everything. 
“President-elect Trump wants it, so do as you’re told.” 
Voter Simon Williams said, “Learning that Nigel Farage is an opportunistic hypocrite only interested in furthering his own political ambitions is just about the least surprising thing to happen in 2016.

Oxford Dictionaries reveal word of the year as “clusterfuck”,"Wednesday 16 November 2016 by Spacey Oxford Dictionaries reveal word of the year as “clusterfuck” 
In the era of Donald Trump and Brexit, Oxford Dictionaries has declared “clusterfuck” to be its international word of the year after its use increased by 200,000% compared to last year. 
Defined by the dictionary as “denoting circumstances in which everything has gone completely tits-up”, clusterfuck is also the collective noun for a group of government ministers. 
Oxford Dictionaries’ word of the year is intended to “reflect the passing year in language”, with clusterfuck following last year’s controversial choice of the “I can’t even be bothered with words” emoji. 
Contenders for the title had included “alt-right”, shortened from the fuller form “white supremacists” and defined as a ”media term that normalises extreme racism”. 
Also in the running were terms including coulrophobia, the fear of clowns, and Brexiteer, the clowns of fear. 
“2016 has been eventful,” explained lexicographer Simon Williams. 
“A number of hugely influential and much-loved celebrities have died, and yet Rupert Murdoch celebrated his 85th birthday and married a former supermodel.

Regretful Brexiter realises he actually just really missed old Top Gear,"Tuesday 22 November 2016 by Thomas Gane Regretful Brexiter realises he actually just really missed old Top Gear 
A previously passionate and angry Brexiter has realised he never really wanted to leave the European Union, and actually just had a lot of pent-up feelings about Top Gear . 
Simon Williams, 32, stayed in on Friday evening to watch the first episode of Jeremy Clarkson, James May and Richard Hammond’s new series, The Grand Tour , on Amazon. 
Following the programme he was surprised to find himself horrified at the Brexit stories that he had up until this moment aggressively supported. 
“After I watched The Grand Tour I felt amazing,” he explained to reporters. 
“It was like reaching an itch I’d been desperately trying to scratch for a year and a half.” 
“Then I checked the news and it was awful. Leaving the EU is going to have some really horrible consequences for our country, and I think I supported it because I had a lot of unresolved feelings about Top Gear . 
“Looking back, I think I actually just wanted to hear Clarkson talk about political correctness, steak and Argies, and the Brexit rhetoric was a surrogate for that. 
“It’s a little embarrassing actually” he added. “My mates in the Whatsapp group are feeling the same. Is there anyway we can take it back?” 
Professor Scott Chegg from the University of Bristol said this conforms to the ‘safety-valve’ theory of politics.

"American fascist really, really likes British fascist","Tuesday 22 November 2016 by Neil Tollfree American fascist really, really likes British fascist 
America’s top fascist and President Elect Donald Trump has announced that he really, really likes British fascist Nigel Farage. 
“I don’t think we should be surprised,” said Professor of History Simon Williams, with tears in his eyes. 
“We saw this in the 30s and 40s; German fascist Adolf Hitler really, really liked Mussolini, and then went on to really, really like other leading fascists in the world. 
“In much the same way that if, say, you support Chelsea, you will probably really, really like other Chelsea supporters, so will fascists really, really like other fascists. 
“Not that I’m suggesting that all Chelsea supporters are fascists, some of them definitely aren’t.” 
Donald Trump announced via Twitter that he would really, really like a fascist, in the form of Nigel Farage, to be British ambassador to the United States. 
It is believed that Mr Farage has been fully tumescent since meeting Donald Trump in a big gold lift several days ago, and the suggestion that he should be Britain’s first fascist ambassador is expected to continue this state of affairs for the foreseeable future. 
Although it is understood that what Mr Trump would really, really like is a fascist Prime Minister of Great Britain, he has stopped short of suggesting a fascist coup in the country because he isn’t President yet, as it could be considered a little rude. ",1
Would-be Ambassador Farage asks EU parliament for character reference,"Tuesday 22 November 2016 by Gary Stanton Would-be Ambassador Farage asks EU parliament for character reference 
Nigel Farage is hopeful that a glowing character reference from the guys in Brussels will clinch him the US Ambassador job. 
The former non-racist UKIP leader has been asked by President-elect, Donald Trump, to provide three good character references from somebody who isn’t a member of, or donor to, UKIP. 
Trump’s spokesman Simon Williams said, “The reference should be from someone who has worked closely with Nigel on a daily basis for more than ten years and who isn’t already married to him. 
“We’re looking for written evidence of Nigel’s willingness to overcome difficulties and work with others in a harmonious way, irrespective of gender, race or creed – although those last three are not that important, obviously. 
“We’ll also check things like his attendance – for things like crucial parliamentary votes. 
“It’s just a formality, really.” 
Farage, meanwhile, insists he is a ‘shoe-in’ for the role after describing himself on his CV as a ‘proactive self-starter who thrives under pressure – from immigration’. 
But former EU parliamentary colleague Herman van Rompuy said, “I’m afraid it is above my pay grade to provide Mr Farage with a reference as, to use his words, I am little more than a jumped-up bank clerk with the charisma of a damp rag.” Get the best NewsThump stories in your mailbox every Friday, for FREE!

Donald Trump appoints Lord Voldemort as Chief of Staff,"Monday 14 November 2016 by Neil Tollfree Donald Trump appoints Lord Voldemort as Chief of Staff 
President Elect Trump has begun naming who will serve on his cabinet, and amongst the most eye-catching is the appointment of Lord Voldemort as Chief of Staff. 
“We knew that President Trump would need someone who could practise magic,” said US political expert Simon Williams. 
“Building a wall, repealing Obamacare, deporting three million people. That’s all on the first day. I can’t see any way of getting that done without the use of some pretty powerful magic. 
“But appointing the evilest wizard for thousands and thousands of years? That is a bold move.” 
Lord Voldemort, who has been described as a ‘raging psychopath, devoid of normal human responses to other people’s suffering’ will be in charge of the day-to-day operation of President Trump’s White House, including controlling access to the President, management of staff, and organising Secret Santa for the Christmas party. 
It is understood that Lord Voldemort had been seeking a return to public life after his humiliating defeat at the hands of Harry Potter, and came close to replacing Randy Jackson on Season 13 of American Idol, but turned it down for a promised role in Celebrity Masterchef that fell through. 
Rumours that Lord Voldemort was only offered the role after Sauron, Dark Lord of Mordor, turned it down to work with David Davis on Brexit, are so far unconfirmed. Get the best NewsThump stories in your mailbox every Friday, for FREE! There are currently ",1
‘Fake news is way better than real news’ insists Facebook’s Mark Zuckerberg,"Tuesday 15 November 2016 by Gabe Faulkner ‘Fake news is way better than real news’ insists Facebook’s Mark Zuckerberg 
Facebook chief executive Mark Zuckerberg has defended his company from criticism about the proliferation of ‘fake’ news stories on the social network, insisting that real news “absolutely sucks”. 
“Let’s face it, in the past year, the UK flushed itself down the toilet of global politics, an orange misogynist was elected leader of the free world, and Alan Rickman died. People really don’t want to hear about that stuff,” Mr Zuckerberg wrote in a statement published on his public newsfeed. 
“If everyone just accepted the news on Facebook without question, you’d be living in a world where Barack Obama has been re-elected for a third term, weed is legal everywhere, and democracy actually works. 
“The top story today in Facebook news is the release of the tenth Harry Potter book. You can live in that beautiful world. 
“Just let go of reality, and submit yourself unconditionally to my will.” 
Tech analyst Norman Greenfield commented, “Is Facebook reporting the story about ‘fake news’ on Facebook? If so, how do we know that this ‘fake news’ story isn’t fake? 
“This whole situation has to an infinitely escalating set of ‘fake news’ reports that I just can’t get my head around. I’m so tired.” 
Facebook users were quick to voice their support of Mr Zuckerberg. Angela Marmot from Wolverhampton commented, “If you like this, then you’ll LOVE our app for Asian hook-ups – click here”. Get the best NewsThump stories in your mailbox every Friday, for FREE! There are currently ",1

A man who has not been on a night out since 2007 is said to be delighted by the decision of Islington Council to grant a new licence to London nightclub, Fabric. 
Simon Williams, who doesn’t even go to the pub with his friends anymore and is only ever seen at social occasions orchestrated by his wife, revealed his feelings on Facebook. 
Simon posted, “So delighted to see Fabric is going to reopen. I spent many a top night there in my party days. 
“People like me can find so much creativity and inspiration in places like Fabric, so I couldn’t be happier the council is changing its mind.” 
A Friend of Simon’s who still has a social life and actually goes out clubbing on a semi-regular basis said “Yeah, Simon’s full of shit. He’s never been to Fabric in his life. 
“He told me he tried to get in once in 2001 but was turned away because he was on a stag do dressed as a Smurf. Back in his so-called ‘party days’, he spent most of his time throwing up in various All Bar Ones.

Ed Balls targeting Strictly opponents with extreme violence,"Monday 21 November 2016 by Gary Stanton Ed Balls targeting Strictly opponents with extreme violence 
Ed Balls is using gangs of armed thugs to intimidate those who would come between him and the Strictly crown. 
The news comes after fellow contestant Gorka Marquez was beaten up in Blackpool by card-carrying New Labour thugs. 
Balls has been accused of using a win-at-all-costs mentality that might have helped him to a more successful career in politics. 
Marquez’s kicking comes just weeks after Will Young sensationally quit the show after being cornered in an alleyway by a tooled-up Alistair Campbell. 
Meanwhile, the former Shadow Chancellor was filmed making a cut-throat gesture to dancers Ore and Joanne as they wowed judges with a series of dazzling spins in their Viennese Waltz. 
Several members of the show now have full police protection after dancers Danny & Oti received a mysterious late-night phone call from a man who sounded as though he was out of breath. 
Last night, Balls congratulated contestants Judge Rinder and Oskana on their near-perfect Salsa routine, which achieved a ‘ten from Len’. 
He added, “However, it’s difficult to dance The Charleston with your leg in plaster.” Get the best NewsThump stories in your mailbox every Friday, for FREE! There are currently ",1
Woman faces jail for dismal selection of office birthday cakes,"Tuesday 22 November 2016 by Neil Tollfree Woman faces jail for dismal selection of office birthday cakes 
An Essex woman is facing prison for providing a dismal selection of cakes for the office to celebrate her birthday. 
The incident took place at the offices of Hadley and Kemp Solutions in Hatfield Peveral yesterday. It was Eileen Plankton’s birthday and anticipation was high as she entered the office with several Marks and Spencer bags. 
“Oh yeah, everyone was really impressed,” said a colleague who wished to remain anonymous. 
“I mean – Markses; I thought we were in for a real treat. They do a lovely cream horn.” 
After several hours of playfully tormenting her colleagues with amusing comments like ‘these bags? No, they’re just lunch. I’m a bit peckish today,’ Mrs Plankton finally sent the following email: 
21 again, and if you believe that you’ll believe anything. Some sweet treats on Len’s desk (he’s off having his prolapse sorted, so he won’t mind). 
However, excitement turned to disappointment as the true nature of the cakes became clear. 
“Well, she might as well have just shat all over the desk,” continued Mrs Plankton’s colleague. 
“They weren’t Markses cakes at all, she’d just reused the bags. There was a box of Poundstretcher’s broken biscuits, some cheap cheese straws and six boxes of Value jam tarts. 
“I mean, I didn’t know what to do with myself. This horrible silence descended as everyone saw what she’d done. 
“I just ate nine jam tarts without looking at her and walked off not even bothering to say ‘Thank you’.” 
Shortly afterwards the police were called, Mrs Plankton was arrested and she is expected to be sentenced to between 18-24 months for her crimes. Get the best NewsThump stories in your mailbox every Friday, for FREE! There are currently ",1
Lin-Manuel Miranda announces new musical about Trump University,"Monday 21 November 2016 Lin-Manuel Miranda announces new musical about Trump University 
The creator of the musical Hamilton is close to completing his new show based upon Trump University. 
The musical will focus on the back story of Trump University and will include the tale of the creation of a fraudulent organisation, the plot to mis-sell so-called educational courses, the mass exploitation of its customers for financial gain, and a final act which focusses on the out of court settlement forced on Donald Trump. 
Miranda explained, “I like to tell stories that people don’t really know much about, and I was worried that Donald Trump angrily tweeting at a musical over the weekend might distract people from hearing about him paying $25m to the people who sued him for fraud in the Trump University case. 
“So I put together a few tracks to ensure the story will last the ages. 
“The songs are almost complete, including a surprisingly upbeat R&B number called Orange bastard lied to me’, and the more soulful ballads Ain’t no way to hide this shit and Lawyers say I gotta settle now or have my shit dragged through the streets for months before ultimately being found guilty of fraud.

Nicola Sturgeon refuses to accept result of England vs Scotland match,"Saturday 12 November 2016 by Davywavy Nicola Sturgeon refuses to accept result of England vs Scotland match 
Nicola Sturgeon believes the result of the England vs Scotland game yesterday was ‘wrong’ and will fight for it to be overturned. 
The 3-0 defeat was the wrong result for Scotland, she said, and pledged to do everything in her power to reverse the scoreline no matter how long it takes. 
Reports indicate she has already made a succession of calls to Senior UEFA and FIFA officials to seek their support in changing the outcome. 
If she cannot get the result changed by conventional methods, Sturgeon confirmed she has not taken demanding a replay off the table. 
“I don’t believe this result is in the best interest of Scotland, or of football, and it is clear that changing it would be entirely fair,” she told reporters at Holyrood. 
“UEFA’s position that the result is binding just because we lost is short-termist and doesn’t serve the Scottish people in the way they deserve.” 
Sturgeon went on to say she believed England had stolen literally dozens of goals that were rightfully Scottish, and she would organise a wide-ranging consultation and enquiry to examine all aspects of the result and report on how it can best be changed in Scotland’s favour. 
Meanwhile, today’s copy of The National newspaper is reporting that Scotland won 18-0 before burning Wembley to the ground. Get the best NewsThump stories in your mailbox every Friday, for FREE! There are currently ",1
Man to be cryogenically preserved until ‘everything stops being shit’,"Friday 18 November 2016 by Neil Tollfree Man to be cryogenically preserved until ‘everything stops being shit’ 
Following a court’s decision to allow the body of a teenager to be cryogenically preserved until her disease can be cured, a man is seeking to be cryogenically preserved until everything is no longer shit. 
“It’s not really about being in ill-health for me,” said Simon Williams. 
“It’s just what with Brexit, Westworld ending, and the continued lack of any quality English tennis players coming through, everything’s a bit rubbish at the moment. 
“So I reckon that having your heartbeat slowed to nothing and being immersed in liquid nitrogen has got to be better than seeing what else 2016 has got to offer. 
“I’m not really bothered when I’m woken up, just make sure it’s when everything stops being shit.” 
With the current situation of deaths of much-loved musicians and actors being interspersed with catastrophic political upheaval, it is expected that many more people may seek to follow Mr William’s lead and just go to sleep until it all gets better. 
“The way things are going,” continued Mr Williams, “I’d imagine we could see a referendum on whether we all go and live in the sea and the death of everyone featured in the Last Waltz before the year’s out. 
“I just don’t want any part of that.” 
Current estimates are that everything will stop being shit sometime in 2092, when the nation will unite behind a robotic Wayne Rooney, Prime Minister and England captain, who leads England to glory in the first ever North Pole World Cup against the hugely favoured Atlantic island of Wales. ",1
Jose Mourinho to motivate players for Arsenal match by punching them in the face,"Saturday 19 November 2016 by Neil Tollfree Jose Mourinho to motivate players for Arsenal match by punching them in the face 
Manchester United manager Jose Mourinho is to take his confrontational style of management a stage further and prepare all his players for today’s crucial Arsenal match by punching them all squarely in the face. 
The news follows Mourinho’s criticism of Chris Smalling for not playing with a broken toe and Luke Shaw for having a broken leg and not being ‘brave.’ 
“My players are all total bastards,” said the grumpy Portuguese, either as some magnificent psychological game that no one but he can understand, or as another stage in what increasingly looks like a total psychotic breakdown. 
“I despise them for not making the goals I want, but I am Mourinho. I understand players. How to make them play better for me. 
“I will punch them in the face. All of them. I will continue to punch them all in the face until they score all the goals I want them to. 
“I am no longer the Special One, I am the Punchy One.” 
Pundits seemed impressed with Mourinho’s plans. 
“The problem with players today is they’re soft-arsed, headphone shitters,” said Chris Sutton, angrily. 
“A punch in the face would do them all the power of good. 
“And a kick in the balls wouldn’t hurt, either.

Petition to have Michael Gove cryogenically frozen reaches 9 million,"Friday 18 November 2016 by Lucas Wilde Petition to have Michael Gove cryogenically frozen reaches 9 million 
Britain is extremely keen for Michael Gove to be shoved into a freezer, it has emerged. 
A petition to put Gove on ice reached 9 million signatures last night, the ramifications of which would see the little bastard shoved into a deep freeze whether he fancies it, or not. 
“I’ve signed it twice,” beamed non-expert, Simon Williams. 
“I’ve even got a spare chest freezer we could use. It’s only waist-height, but I’m sure we can fold him into it somehow, with a hammer if necessary. 
“I’m pretty sure that’s how cryogenics works, having watched Batman and Robin nearly all the way through. 
“I’ve not heard what Gove thinks about all of this, but frankly I’m not too bothered about that.” 
A spokesperson for Mr Gove said, “Michael is delighted by all of this. 
“In fact, he has instructed me to deliver him to the nearest branch of Currys as soon as possible, and to ignore any protests he might make. 
“He says he might put up a bit of a fight getting into the freezer, but he would like to assure the public that this is all part of the experience. 
“I can give my own personal assurance that Michael has given his full, honest consent to being frozen.

Kate Bush would make a magnificent queen for the United Kingdom, Donald Trump has suggested.

“In that video, she looks equally good in a skin tight catsuit and a chain mail bikini. Not many women can pull that off. 
“Ok so she’s in her 50s now, but that kind of works for me. Plus Elizabeth is how old? A hundred and nine? Most people would see Kate Bush as a serious upgrade.

Nigel Farage held at Heathrow on return from Trump visit due to ‘mysterious brown substance’ on nose,"Monday 14 November 2016 by Benedict Farkerhausen Nigel Farage held at Heathrow on return from Trump visit due to ‘mysterious brown substance’ on nose 
Nigel Farage has spent the day in the Heathrow Airport holding cells as officials quiz him on a mysterious, smelly brown substance found on his nose. 
The UKIP interim leader had flown back into the country after spending much of the weekend cosying up to fellow man of the people, President-elect Donald Trump, in a Manhattan penthouse apartment painted gold. 
Simon Williams, Home Office spokesman, said, “Our sniffer dogs are trained to smell even the tiniest remnants of illicit substances on clothing and suitcases. 
“However, they were not needed this time as fellow passengers and staff were all able to notice this foul stench wafting through the cabin since the flight took off in New York. 
“On inspection, Mr Farage’s nose was found to be thickly cased in a brown substance, which we are treating as a biological hazard. 
Further traces were found on his tongue, and we’ve sent it off for further testing.” 
A UKIP spokesman said, “In the human centipede that is diplomatic relations with the US, Nigel has valiantly shown his willingness to get on all fours and bury his face deep inside Mr Trump’s rectum for the good of Queen and country. 
“The country needs the intimate knowledge Nigel possesses of this man, and we await a call from Number 10 wanting his expertise. Get the best NewsThump stories in your mailbox every Friday, for FREE! There are currently ",1
‘Suspicious object’ at Daily Mail offices identified as a piece of factual journalism,"Monday 14 November 2016 by Davywavy and Spacey ‘Suspicious object’ at Daily Mail offices identified as a piece of factual journalism 
The offices of The Daily Mail were evacuated earlier after a suspicious object later identified as a piece of journalism was discovered in the building. 
A spokesman for the Daily Mail & General Trust confirmed they had no idea how the fact came to be at Northcliffe House and it definitely wasn’t theirs. 
Chief Ad salesman Simon Williams told us how he made the discovery. 
“My suspicions were first aroused when I saw this bit of research that included actual data and verified citations on it just lying about, and I thought ‘There’s no reason that should be here’. 
“Clearly nobody at the newspaper would have something like that nowadays, so it must have been brought in by an outsider.” 
The owner of the factual journalism has not been identified, although police are confident it did not originate in the offices of rival outlets such as the Guardian or the Canary. 
Security services are understood to be wanting to talk to a man they describe as ‘suspicious’ as CCTV footage shows him doing some actual research and speaking to experts before writing an article. 
Police described the evacuation of the offices as extremely orderly. 
“It was dead easy,” we were told. 
“We just turned on the BBC news and everyone just covered their ears and ran from the building.” 
The accurate reflection of events was discovered at around 1.30pm, and staff were told to wait in the street outside while the Mail’s specialist team of fact disposal experts investigated its contents. 
As one member of the fact disposal team explained, “We have spent thousands of man-hours perfecting the art of taking dangerous facts and making them safe for consumption by our readers. This was no different, and we were ready. 
“By the time we had finished, I can assure everyone the content was completely fact-free.” ",1
Short-sighted pervert disappointed not to see a film called ‘Fantastic Breasts and Where to Find Them’,"Monday 21 November 2016 by Davywavy and H Short-sighted pervert disappointed not to see a film called ‘Fantastic Breasts and Where to Find Them’ 
A solitary cinema-goer was today loudly demanding a refund of £18 from the Odeon Leicester Square, ‘plus the money for the 3D glasses’. 
Myopic raincoat wearer and aggrieved onanist Simon Williams, 47, told the Thump, “I’ve always had a keen interest in the, hem, hem, beauties of nature.” 
“From the pert cups of budding maidenhood to the more rrrrounded and queenly figure,” he added, breathing rapidly and mopping sweat off his face. 
In answer to our next question, Mr Williams confirmed that he had never had a girlfriend, but didn’t think this had been an impediment. 
“Au contraire,” he confided, with what we assume was a roguish snort. 
“Sadly,” Williams went on, “over the years, my hobby has led to a deterioration in my eyesight, as my old scoutmaster once warned me would happen. 
“And this has led to me making a perfectly natural and disappointing mistake in the title of a film, for which I hold the Odeon cinema chain entirely culpable.” 
Ordering a couple of bouncers to throw Williams roughly out into the street, the Odeon manager emphasised that he would not be welcome back in the cinema “now or at any future time.” 
“And I’ve warned the Vue and the Empire to keep an eye open for him as well,” he added. Get the best NewsThump stories in your mailbox every Friday, for FREE! There are currently witterings below - why not add your own? ",1

Brexiter Simon Williams has insisted the Chancellor’s claim that government finances are £122bn worse off post-Brexit is pure scaremongering, and will continue to believe that is the case until he sees it written on a bus. 
Williams said that today’s Autumn statement by Chancellor Philip Hammond, which highlighted the £122bn figure, is based on nothing more than research and expert opinion, and as such should be discarded without a moment’s thought. 
He went on, “Everyone knows that financial facts are written on buses, it’s the British way. 
“You can say whatever you like with your reports, analysis and experts – until I see it driving down the motorway in two foot high letters I won’t believe a word of it. You can make up a report; you can’t make up an entire bus! 
“If the £122bn figure was true, they would have put it on a bus, of course they would. It’s how the British electorate expects to be told about the economy, dumbass. 
“Show me a bus that says the country’s finances are £122bn worse off after voting for Brexit, and then we’ll talk – but until then, you can piss off.” 
Williams went on to explain that Brexit is the best thing that has ever happened to the country, before heading to the Post Office to buy some Euros for a stag do he’s about to attend. ",1
Minority Report-Style Mark Of The Beast ‘CLEAR’ Human Tracking System Gets Installed At Detroit Airport,"  Minority Report-Style Mark Of The Beast ‘CLEAR’ Human Tracking System Gets Installed At Detroit Airport CLEAR will speed Houston travelers through airport security in minutes at both Bush and William P. Hobby. CLEAR's innovative biometric technology is transforming travel for individuals and corporations while enhancing homeland security and modernizing the checkpoint experience.   27, 2016 Metro Detroit Airport now has a new way to allow people to move seamlessly through airport security . 
“And he causeth all, both small and great, rich and poor, free and bond, to receive a mark in their right hand, or in their foreheads: And that no man might buy or sell, save he that had the mark, or the name of the beast, or the number of his name.” Revelation 13:16,17 (KJV) 
EDITOR’S NOTE: If you are waiting for the Mark of the Beast , you should know that the system that will surround and support the MOTB is already here and you are already a part of it. Every time you access any feature on any smart device, you are creating a record of you activity that is then recorded and stored in places like the Utah Data Center . Aren’t you glad that the Pretribulation Rapture removes us believers before the Beast makes his appearance? I sure am. The future has already arrived people, pay attention. 
It’s called CLEAR and it’s now in operation at the airport’s McNamara Terminal . Certified as a “qualified anti-terrorism technology” by the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, CLEAR has been used more than five million times to move travelers quickly through airport security lines at 16 other airports. CLEAR Transforms Houston Travel Experience and Homeland Security: 
“They validate their identity using a knowledge-based quiz, they use a government identification that’s validated using technology, and then we link it to their bio-metrics — we take 10 fingerprints with a digital reader, we take a scan of their iris, and we take a high-res photo of their face,” said CLEAR spokesperson David Cohen. Minority Report was like a prophecy of what the future would hold for us in the 21st century, and it’s all come true: 
Cohen said the initial sign-up process takes about five minutes and after that, getting through security lines should be a breeze. He said there are special lines for CLEAR customers that can be a great time-saver for travelers, who will still have to pass through X-Rays and body scans. 
“Our customers go through the TSA security process in minutes. They come to a CLEAR lane, that lane is going to be open and available for them to validate their identity on the spot, a process in itself that takes less than a second,” he said. 
Membership to use CLEAR costs $179 per year. New members who enroll at the airport receive a one-month free trial and can use CLEAR immediately.

Secondly, you see when anyone steps in front of that background, there appears a darkened halo around them. Why would that be? Well, that happens in what we call green screen technology , and in this case, poorly done green screen. Hillary Clinton Rally in Coconut Creek, Florida using green screen: 
Start watching at the 1:03:00 mark to see where Crooked Hillary starts speaking. 
Another salient clue that she used a green screen is that when she turns around to wave to these people, they are mere feet away and yet she shakes hands with none of them. Why, because they weren’t there. Liberal news rag CNN is infamous for pretending to be in a location but in reality it’s nothing more than green screen. CNN did it here , here , and also here . The handheld video camera exposes the lie: 
Look in the viewfinder of the video camera filming Crooked Hillary – it’s black behind her yet in the official video it’s filled with people. Hmm…awake yet, America? 
Lastly, if you look close at the end of the video , you will see the real people behind her with cameras, but then the main group of people behind them are flattened out in 2-D because they are not actually there.

Beth Moore suggested that Trump’s words from 11 years ago highlight how men are “objectifying” women today, and she made clear that she will not support Trump over it. She issued a number of tweets on the topic, not one of which criticized Hillary Clinton for the way she has treated the women who allege Bill Clinton sexually assaulted them — women like Paula Jones and Juanita Broaddrick, the latter of whom recently recounted the way Bill Clinton allegedly raped her.

The Daily Mail reported that “Jones reached an out of court settlement” in a suit wherein she alleged that Bill, while Governor of Arkansas, dropped his pants and asked her “ to kiss it .” Beth Moore False Vision: 
What does a false teacher and false prophet sound like? It sounds exactly like this…. 
Trump stood up for these women , holding a press conference with them on Sunday as a way of breaking through the mainstream media’s refusal to report on Bill’s sexual history and Hillary’s efforts to undermine that history. Heretofore, Hillary’s canned response to Bill’s accusers has been to go after the women. In fact, she has gone after the women with such fervor that the Washington Post recently asked if Hillary was Bill’s “enabler”? Hillary Clinton, Donald Trump spar over partial-birth abortion during third debate: 
The Post reported : 
… Hillary Clinton dismissed an accusation made by Gennifer Flowers, the singer who sold her story to a supermarket tabloid after having previously denied an affair. In an ABC News interview, she called Flowers “some failed cabaret singer who doesn’t even have much of a résumé to fall back on.” She told Esquire magazine in 1992 that if she had the chance to cross-examine Flowers, “I mean, I would crucify her.” 
Trump brought a small number of women from Bill’s past to the October 9 presidential debate, where he pointed out that they should be honored for standing up, rather than humiliated. Politico published the transcript of Trump looking at Bill’s accusers, then saying: 
Hillary Clinton attacked those same women, and attacked them viciously, four of them here tonight … So don’t tell me about words. I am, absolutely, I apologize for those words, but it is things that people say, but what President Clinton did, he was impeached, he lost his license to practice law, he had to pay an $850,000 fine to one of the women. Paula Jones who is also here tonight. And I will tell you that when Hillary brings up a point like that and she talks about words that I said 11 years ago, I think it’s disgraceful and I think she should be ashamed of herself, if you want to know the truth. 
Yet Christian speaker Beth Beth Moore focused her attention on Trump. In an October 9 tweet, Moore said , “I’m one among many women sexually abused, misused, stared down, heckled, talked naughty to. Like we liked it. We didn’t. We’re tired of it.” 
In another tweet on the same day, Moore criticized evangelicals who continue to stand with Trump: “Try to absorb how acceptable the disesteem and objectifying of women has been when some Christian leaders don’t think it’s that big a deal.” 
It would be interesting to ask Monica Lewinsky , Paula Jones, Kathleen Willey, and Juanita Broaddrick which was most painful, words that Trump spoke 11 years ago — and subsequently apologized for — or Bill Clinton’s actions and alleged actions, combined with Hillary Clinton’s treatment of women who dared to speak up? source

THE SMOKING GUN: WikiLeaks Emails Show Proof Positive Of Vast Clinton Foundation Corruption,"NTEB Ads Privacy Policy THE SMOKING GUN: WikiLeaks Emails Show Proof Positive Of Vast Clinton Foundation Corruption It is astonishingly detailed proof that the Clintons do not draw any lines between their “charitable” work, their political activity, their government jobs or (and most important) their personal enrichment. Every other American is expected to keep these pursuits separate, as required by tax law, anticorruption law and campaign-finance law. For the Clintons, it is all one and the same—the rules be damned. by Geoffrey Grider October 28, 2016 Grifters-in-Chief: The Clintons don’t draw lines between their ‘charity’ and personal enrichment. 
In an election season that has been full of surprises , let’s hope the electorate understands that there is at least one thing of which it can be certain: A Hillary Clinton presidency will be built, from the ground up, on self-dealing, crony favors, and an utter disregard for the law. 
This isn’t a guess. It is spelled out, in black and white, in the latest bombshell revelation from WikiLeaks . It comes in the form of a memo written in 2011 by longtime Clinton errand boy Doug Band, who for years worked simultaneously at the Clinton Foundation and at the head of his lucrative consulting business, Teneo. 
It is astonishingly detailed proof that the Clintons do not draw any lines between their “charitable” work, their political activity, their government jobs or (and most important) their personal enrichment. Every other American is expected to keep these pursuits separate, as required by tax law, anticorruption law and campaign-finance law. For the Clintons, it is all one and the same—the rules be damned. Trump: WikiLeaks Shows Clinton Foundation Corruption 
The memo came near the end of a 2011 review by law firm Simpson Thacher & Bartlett into Clinton Foundation practices. Chelsea Clinton had grown concerned about the audacious mixing of public and private, and the review was designed to ensure that the foundation didn’t lose its charitable tax status. Mr. Band, Teneo boss and epicenter of what he calls “ Bill Clinton, Inc.,” clearly felt under assault and was eager to brag up the ways in which his business had concurrently benefited the foundation, Clinton political causes and the Clinton bank account. The memoed result is a remarkably candid look at the sleazy inner workings of the Clinton grifters-in-chief. Rep. Sessions: Clinton Foundation’s fundraising tactics are criminal 
The cross-pollination is flagrant , and Mr. Band gives example after example of how it works. He and his partner Declan Kelly (a Hillary Clinton fundraiser whom Mrs. Clinton rewarded by making him the State Department’s special envoy to Northern Ireland) buttered up their clients with special visits to Bill’s home and tête-à-tête golf rounds with the former president. They then “cultivated” these marks ( Coca-Cola , Dow Chemical , UBS) for foundation dollars, and then again for high-dollar Bill Clinton speeches and other business payouts. Morning Joe Destroys Corrupt Clinton Foundation “Total Corruption” 
Teneo’s incestuous behavior also included Mrs. Clinton’s State Department. The Band memo boasts that Mr. Kelly (while he was Mrs. Clinton’s State envoy) introduced the then-head of UBS Wealth Management, Bob McCann, to Bill Clinton at an American Ireland Fund event in 2009. “Mr. Kelly subsequently asked Mr. Mccann [sic] to support the Foundation, which he did . . . Mr. Kelly also encouraged Mr. Mccann [sic] to invite President Clinton to give several paid speeches, which he has done,” reads Mr. Band’s memo. UBS ultimately paid Bill $2 million. 
American Ireland Fund meanwhile became a Teneo client, and made Mr. Kelly (of former State envoy fame) a trustee, where he “ensured that the AIF is a significant donor to the Foundation.” AIF then bestowed upon Mrs. Clinton a major award on her final trip to Northern Ireland in 2012, in an event partly sponsored by . . . Teneo. 
Not that this is all one way. Mr. Band let slip just how useful all these arrangements were for Teneo, too, when he backhandedly apologized in the memo for hosting 15 client meetings in a hotel room rented by the Clinton Global Initiative. 
The memo removes any doubt that the foundation is little more than an unregistered super PAC working on the Clintons’ behalf. Donors to the charity are simultaneously tapped to give Bill speech requests and other business arrangements, including the $3.5 million he was paid annually to serve as “honorary chairman” of Laureate International Universities. Mr. Band’s memo also notes his success at getting donors to “support candidates running for office that President Clinton was supporting.” It’s now 2016 and Bill’s most favorite candidate is running for the presidency. There’s no question foundation donors are being “leveraged” for Mrs. Clinton. 
Mr. Band wants credit in the memo for prodding existing foundation donors to pony up more money, though the donation statistics he provides paint a different picture. By and large, donations to the foundation begin to spike dramatically in 2009 and 2010. Mr. Band didn’t form Teneo until 2011. What was happening in 2009? Mrs. Clinton was sworn in as one of the most powerful politicians on the planet. The Clinton Foundation takes money from countries that deny rights to women: 
The obvious question is where are the prosecutors? (For that matter, where is Lois Lernerwhen you need her?) Any nonprofit lawyer in America knows the ironclad rule of keeping private enrichment away from tax-exempt activity, for the simple reason that mixing the two involves ripping off taxpayers. Every election lawyer in the country lives in fear of stepping over the lines governing fundraising and election vehicles. The Clintons recognize no lines. 
Here’s the lasting takeaway: The Clintons spent their White House years explaining endless sleazy financial deals, and even capping their exit with a scandal over whether Bill was paid to pardon financier Marc Rich. They know the risks. And yet they geared up the foundation and these seedy practices even as Mrs. Clinton was making her first bid for the presidency. They continued them as she sat as secretary of state. They continue them still, as she nears the White House. 
This is how the Clintons operate. They don’t change. Any one who pulls the lever for Crooked Hillary Clinton takes responsibility for setting up the nation for all the blatant corruption that will follow. source SHARE THIS ARTICLE Geoffrey Grider NTEB is run by end times author and editor-in-chief Geoffrey Grider.

Att’y General Loretta Lynch Pleads The 5th When Asked Questions About Obama’s Iran Ransom Payment,"NTEB Ads Privacy Policy Att’y General Loretta Lynch Pleads The 5th When Asked Questions About Obama’s Iran Ransom Payment “Every Obama administration official and department involved in the Iran Deal appear to be running for cover,” the source said. “Like we feared, the Iran deal is turning out to be a disaster and Iran is emboldened in its aggression. Evidently Attorney General Lynch and the Department of Justice have decided ‘refusal to cooperate’ is their best strategy. by Geoffrey Grider October 28, 2016 Attorney General Loretta Lynch is declining to comply with an investigation by leading members of Congress about the Obama administration’s secret efforts to send Iran $1.7 billion in cash earlier this year, prompting accusations that Lynch has “pleaded the Fifth” Amendment to avoid incriminating herself over these payments 
Sen. Marco Rubio (R., Fla.) and Rep. Mike Pompeo (R., Kan.) initially presented Lynch in October with a series of questions about how the cash payment to Iran was approved and delivered. 
In an Oct. 24 response , Assistant Attorney General Peter Kadzik responded on Lynch’s behalf, refusing to answer the questions and informing the lawmakers that they are barred from publicly disclosing any details about the cash payment, which was bound up in a ransom deal aimed at freeing several American hostages from Iran . Loretta Lynch Pleads the Fifth To Protect Obama In Iran $1.7 Billion Hostage Money 
The response from the attorney general’s office is “unacceptable” and provides evidence that Lynch has chosen to “essentially plead the fifth and refuse to respond to inquiries regarding [her] role in providing cash to the world’s foremost state sponsor of terrorism,” Rubio and Pompeo wrote on Friday in a follow-up letter to Lynch, according to a copy obtained by the Free Beacon . 
The inquiry launched by the lawmakers is just one of several concurrent ongoing congressional probes aimed at unearthing a full accounting of the administration’s secret negotiations with Iran. 
“It is frankly unacceptable that your department refuses to answer straightforward questions from the people’s elected representatives in Congress about an important national security issue,” the lawmakers wrote. “Your staff failed to address any of our questions, and instead provided a copy of public testimony and a lecture about the sensitivity of information associated with this issue.” Obama on Iran payment: ‘We do not pay ransom’ 
“As the United States’ chief law enforcement officer, it is outrageous that you would essentially plead the fifth and refuse to respond to inquiries,” they stated. “The actions of your department come at time when Iran continues to hold Americans hostage and unjustly sentence them to prison.” The lawmakers included a copy of their previous 13 questions and are requesting that Lynch provide answers by Nov. 4. 
When asked about Lynch’s efforts to avoid answering questions about the cash payment, Pompeo told the Free Beacon that the Obama administration has blocked Congress at every turn as lawmakers attempt to investigate the payments to Iran. 
“Who knew that simple questions regarding Attorney General Lynch’s approval of billions of dollars in payments to Iran could be so controversial that she would refuse to answer them?” Pompeo said. “This has become the Obama administration’s coping mechanism for anything related to the Islamic Republic of Iran—hide information, obfuscate details, and deny answers to Congress and the American people.” Obama Administration Finally Admits $400M To Iran Was Ransom For Hostages 
“They know this isn’t a sustainable strategy, however, and I trust they will start to take their professional, and moral, obligations seriously,” the lawmaker added. 
In the Oct. 24 letter to Rubio and Pompeo, Assistant Attorney General Kadzik warned the lawmakers against disclosing to the public any information about the cash payment. 
Details about the deal are unclassified, but are being kept under lock and key in a secure facility on Capitol Hill, the Free Beacon first disclosed . Lawmakers and staffers who have clearance to view the documents are forced to relinquish their cellular devices and are barred from taking any notes about what they see. 
“Please note that these documents contain sensitive information that is not appropriate for public release,” Kadzik wrote to the lawmakers. “Disclosure of this information beyond members of the House and Senate and staff who are able to view them could adversely affect the diplomatic relations of the United States, including with key allies, as well as the State Department’s ability to defend [legal] claims against the United States [by Iran] that are still being litigated at the Hague Tribunal.” 
“The public release of any portion of these documents, or the information contained therein, is not authorized by the transmittal of these documents or by this communication,” Kadzik wrote. Congressional sources have told the Free Beacon that this is another part of the effort to hide details about these secret negotiations with Iran from the American public. 
One senior congressional source familiar with both the secret documents and the inquiry into them told the Free Beacon that the details of the negotiations are so damning that the administration’s best strategy is to ignore lawmakers’ requests for more information. 
“Every Obama administration official and department involved in the Iran Deal appear to be running for cover,” the source said. “Like we feared, the Iran deal is turning out to be a disaster and Iran is emboldened in its aggression. Evidently Attorney General Lynch and the Department of Justice have decided ‘refusal to cooperate’ is their best strategy. But this is dangerous and ultimately won’t protect them from anything.” source SHARE THIS ARTICLE Geoffrey Grider NTEB is run by end times author and editor-in-chief Geoffrey Grider.

BOMBSHELL: 2006 Audio Emerges of Crooked Hillary Clinton Proposing Rigging Palestine Election,"  BOMBSHELL: 2006 Audio Emerges of Crooked Hillary Clinton Proposing Rigging Palestine Election “I do not think we should have pushed for an election in the Palestinian territories. I think that was a big mistake,” said Sen. Clinton. “And if we were going to push for an election, then we should have made sure that we did something to determine who was going to win.”   28, 2016 Chomsky recalls being taken aback that “anyone could support the idea—offered by a national political leader, no less—that the U.S. should be in the business of fixing foreign elections.” 
EDITOR’S NOTE: Donald Trump, as usual, knows what he’s talking about when it comes to a rigged system with a rigged election . Today’s story brings you a never-heard-before audio tape of then Sen. Clinton talking about rigging the elections in Palestine to ensure the outcome preferred by the United States government. Looks like Crooked Hillary thinks nothing of rigging an election – any election – to suit her personal purposes. 
On September 5, 2006, Eli Chomsky was an editor and staff writer for the Jewish Press, and Hillary Clinton was running for a shoo-in re-election as a U.S. senator. Her trip making the rounds of editorial boards brought her to Brooklyn to meet the editorial board of the Jewish Press. 
The tape was never released and has only been heard by the small handful of Jewish Press staffers in the room. According to Chomsky, his old-school audio cassette is the only existent copy and no one has heard it since 2006, until today when he played it for the Observer. 
The tape is 45 minutes and contains much that is no longer relevant, such as analysis of the re-election battle that Sen. Joe Lieberman was then facing in Connecticut. But a seemingly throwaway remark about elections in areas controlled by the Palestinian Authority has taken on new relevance amid persistent accusations in the presidential campaign by Clinton’s Republican opponent Donald Trump that the current election is “rigged.” Listen to never-before-seen audiotape of Crooked Hillary talking about rigging election in Palestine: 
Speaking to the Jewish Press about the January 25, 2006, election for the second Palestinian Legislative Council (the legislature of the Palestinian National Authority), Clinton weighed in about the result, which was a resounding victory for Hamas (74 seats) over the U.S.-preferred Fatah (45 seats). 
“I do not think we should have pushed for an election in the Palestinian territories. I think that was a big mistake,” said Sen. Clinton. “And if we were going to push for an election, then we should have made sure that we did something to determine who was going to win.” Chomsky recalls being taken aback that “anyone could support the idea—offered by a national political leader, no less—that the U.S. should be in the business of fixing foreign elections.” 
Some eyebrows were also raised when then-Senator Clinton appeared to make a questionable moral equivalency. 
Regarding capturing combatants in war—the June capture of IDF soldier Gilad Shalit by Hamas militants who came across the Gaza border via an underground tunnel was very much front of mind—Clinton can be heard on the tape saying, “And then, when, you know, Hamas, you know, sent the terrorists, you know, through the tunnel into Israel that killed and captured, you know, kidnapped the young Israeli soldier, you know, there’s a sense of like, one-upsmanship, and in these cultures of, you know, well, if they captured a soldier, we’ve got to capture a soldier.” Trump on Election Rigging | Third Presidential Debate Highlights 
Equating Hamas , which to this day remains on the State Department’s official list of Foreign Terrorist Organizations, with the armed forces of a close American ally was not what many expected to hear in the Jewish Press editorial offices, which were then at Third Avenue and Third Street in Brooklyn. (The paper’s office has since moved to the Boro Park section of Brooklyn.) The use of the phrase “these cultures” is also a bit of a head-scratcher. 
According to Chomsky, Clinton was “gracious, personable and pleasant throughout” the interview, taking about an hour to speak to, in addition to himself, managing editor Jerry Greenwald, assistant to the publisher Naomi Klass Mauer, counsel Dennis Rapps and senior editor Jason Maoz. 
Another part of the tape highlights something that was relatively uncontroversial at the time but has taken on new meaning in light of the current campaign—speaking to leaders with whom our country is not on the best terms. Clinton has presented a very tough front in discussing Russia, for example, accusing Trump of unseemly ardor for strongman Vladimir Putin and mocking his oft-stated prediction that as president he’d “get along” with Putin. 
Chomsky is heard on the tape asking Clinton what now seems like a prescient question about Syria, given the disaster unfolding there and its looming threat to drag the U.S., Iran and Russia into confrontation. 
“Do you think it’s worth talking to Syria—both from the U.S. point [of view] and Israel’s point [of view]?” 
Clinton replied, “You know, I’m pretty much of the mind that I don’t see what it hurts to talk to people. As long as you’re not stupid and giving things away. I mean, we talked to the Soviet Union for 40 years. They invaded Hungary, they invaded Czechoslovakia, they persecuted the Jews, they invaded Afghanistan, they destabilized governments, they put missiles 90 miles from our shores, we never stopped talking to them,” an answer that reflects her mastery of the facts but also reflects a willingness to talk to Russia that sounds more like Trump 2016 than Clinton 2016. 
Shortly after, she said, “But if you say, ‘they’re evil, we’re good, [and] we’re never dealing with them,’ I think you give up a lot of the tools that you need to have in order to defeat them…So I would like to talk to you [the enemy] because I want to know more about you. Because if I want to defeat you, I’ve got to know something more about you. I need different tools to use in my campaign against you. That’s my take on it.” 
A final bit of interest to the current campaign involves an articulation of phrases that Trump has accused Clinton of being reluctant to use. Discussing the need for a response to terrorism, Clinton said, “I think you can make the case that whether you call it ‘Islamic terrorism’ or ‘Islamo-fascism,’ whatever the label is we’re going to give to this phenomenon, it’s a threat. It’s a global threat. To Europe, to Israel, to the United States…Therefore we need a global response. It’s a global threat and it needs a global response. That can be the, sort of, statement of principle…So I think sometimes having the global vision is a help as long as you realize that underneath that global vision there’s a lot of variety and differentiation that has to go on.” 
It’s not clear what she means by a global vision with variety and differentiation, but what’s quite clear is that the then-senator, just five years after her state was the epicenter of the September 11 attacks, was comfortable deploying the phrase “Islamic terrorism” and the even more strident “Islamo-fascism,” at least when meeting with the editorial board of a Jewish newspaper. 
In an interview before the Observer heard the tape, Chomsky told the Observer that Clinton made some “odd and controversial comments” on the tape. The irony of a decade-old recording emerging to feature a candidate making comments that are suddenly relevant to voters today was not lost on Chomsky, who wrote the original story at the time. Oddly enough, that story, headlined “Hillary Clinton on Israel, Iraq and Terror,” is no longer available on jewishpress.com and even a short summary published on the Free Republic offers a broken link that can no longer surface the story. 
“I went to my bosses at the time,” Chomsky told the Observer. “The Jewish Press had this mindset that they would not want to say anything offensive about anybody—even a direct quote from anyone—in a position of influence because they might need them down the road. My bosses didn’t think it was newsworthy at the time. I was convinced that it was and I held onto it all these years.”  ",1

"As Crooked HIllary Investigation Reopens, Democrat Cities Push To Allow Illegal Immigrants Voting","  As Crooked HIllary Investigation Reopens, Democrat Cities Push To Allow Illegal Immigrants Voting 'Look at illegal immigrants voting all over the country,' Donald Trump recently claimed in a Fox News interview, part of his ongoing effort to cast doubt on the integrity of the presidential election. There’s no evidence to support the Republican nominee’s claims of election fraud, but some cities are moving to expand voting rights to include noncitizens.   29, 2016 Some Democrat-Run Cities Want Their Illegal Alien Population to Vote 
EDITOR’S NOTE: Yesterday, FBI director James Comey announced that they have reopened the investigation into Crooked Hillary’s illegal email server. Yay! But even before that, Democrat operatives are working around the clock to skew the election results in any way they can. Today we present to you Democrat-run cities in America allowing illegal immigrants to vote in the upcoming election. Should illegal immigrant voting be legal? Wha…??? 
‘Look at illegal immigrants voting all over the country,’ Donald Trump recently claimed in a Fox News interview, part of his ongoing effort to cast doubt on the integrity of the presidential election. There’s no evidence to support the Republican nominee’s claims of election fraud, but some cities are moving to expand voting rights to include non-citizens (illegal immigrants) . Trump Opposes Same-Day Voter Registration to Prevent Illegal Immigrants from Voting: 
The latest is San Francisco , where the Nov. 8 ballot will include a measure allowing the parents or legal guardians of any student in the city’s public schools to vote in school board elections. The right would be extended to those with green cards, visas, or no documentation at all. “One out of three kids in the San Francisco unified school system has a parent who is an immigrant, who is disenfranchised and doesn’t have a voice,” says San Francisco Assemblyman David Chiu, the son of Taiwanese immigrants. “We’ve had legal immigrants who’ve had children go through the entire K-12 system without having a say.” Undocumented immigrants should also have the right, Chiu adds, to bypass the “broken immigration system in this country.” Should Illegal Immigrants Be Allowed to Vote in US Elections? 
Today there are six jurisdictions in Maryland that let non-citizens (illegal immigrants) vote in local elections. Chicago allows them to take part in elected parent advisory councils but not to vote in school board elections. Four towns in Massachusetts have moved to allow noncitizen voting and are awaiting state approval. And in New York City, where non-citizens (illegal immigrants) make up 21 percent of the voting-age population, the city council is drafting legislation that would allow more than 1.3 million legal residents to take part in municipal elections. The city previously allowed non-citizens (illegal immigrants) to vote in school board elections, but that ended when New York’s school boards were dissolved in 2002. Liberals Sign Petition to Allow Illegal Immigrants to Vote in 2016 Presidential Election: 
San Francisco has tried in the past to grant noncitizens access to school board elections. A 2004 measure narrowly failed, with 51 percent voting against it. “There was an opposition campaign at that time,” Chiu says. He sponsored another ballot measure in 2010, which also failed. This time, Chiu says, he’s hoping for a victory.

Have you ever sat back and watched someone who was working up the nerve to do something nasty like shoplift from a store or slash someone’s tire? They go back and forth, reasoning amongst themselves, until they finally have worked up the courage to carry out the deed. That’s exactly what happened today on Saint George Street in St. Augustine, FL, as I stood there and watched the event unfold. 
This woman , obviously a Crooked Hillary supporter , was walking with 3 other friends, when they stopped to watch a meeting of the St. Augustine Tea Party on the street corner. They all stopped and she went back and forth with herself until she had the nerve to confront – then assault – this member of the Tea Party. 
The Tea Party member asked her: “Why do you kill babies?” 
Her immediate response was: “Because it keeps the crime rate down”. 
Flabbergasted at her answer , he asked her again and she again gave the same response. Moments later, she flies into a rage, rips the sign out of his hand and throws it to the ground, then rips the Tea Party flag out of his hand and throws that to the ground.

Crooked Hillary Risks Having ‘Blue Dress Moment’ By Aggressively Attacking FBI And James Comey,"  Crooked Hillary Risks Having ‘Blue Dress Moment’ By Aggressively Attacking FBI And James Comey Since Crooked Hillary has no idea what the FBI actually found, her gambit is every bit as bold, and reckless, as was her husband's decades earlier. She has now painted herself into the proverbial corner, and any evidence that the FBI produces will be amplified in light of her vigorous denials.   30, 2016 Interestingly, in 2016 at the height of the race for president, Hillary decides to adopt Bill’s bold denial strategy 
Way back when in 1998 , as the Bill Clinton sex scandal with intern Monica Lewinsky was coming to light, Slick Willy decided on a very risky strategy. Knowing full well that he was 100% guilty as charged, he decided to look right into the unblinking eye of the camera and issue a full-throated denial of any involvement of any kind. Watch and see it for yourself: Bill Clinton denies having an inappropriate relationship with Monica Lewinsky: 
Now what Bill Clinton did not know was that Monica had saved a semen-stained blue dress with Bill Clinton’s semen on it, which she promptly presented as evidence to prove that she was not lying. By this time she was being trashed by Clinton operatives desperate to save Bill’s presidency, chief of whom was Crooked Hillary who had lots of nasty things to say about her husband’s victims. That led to this moment as seen here: Bill Clinton admits to having an inappropriate relationship with Monica Lewinsky: Interestingly, in 2016 at the height of the race for president, Hillary decides to adopt Bill’s bold denial strategy 
Hillary Clinton’s campaign hopes, as reported by Bloomberg today , its unusually swift response to revelations about a fresh FBI investigation into messages in connection with a past probe of her private e-mail server will blunt the political damage amid concern about close Senate races as well as the presidential election. 
With nine days to go until the election , Clinton and her aides went on the attack, intensifying criticism of James Comey as word emerged that the FBI director defied U.S. Attorney General Loretta Lynch by informing lawmakers of newly discovered e-mails that may relate to its investigation of the Democratic presidential nominee. Hillary Clinton addresses FBI email investigation: 
Clinton’s aggressive strategy contrasts with her bunker mentality in previous episodes of the controversy over her e-mail practices at the State Department. Her campaign is taking a calculated risk in publicly criticizing Comey and pressing him to quickly release more detail. Should new information contradict past statements or call into question the judgment of Clinton or any of her advisers who migrated from the Obama administration to her campaign, it could be damaging. 
Her rival Donald Trump told an audience in Phoenix the “only reason” Comey must have felt the need to tell lawmakers of the newly discovered e-mails is that “very, very serious things must be happening and must have been found. Very, very serious. Very, very serious.” 
Since Crooked Hillary has no idea what the FBI actually found, her gambit is every bit as bold, and reckless, as was her husband’s decades earlier. She has now painted herself into the proverbial corner, and any evidence that the FBI produces will be amplified in light of her vigorous denials. The WikiLeaks emails showed us that even John Podesta said she “lacks judgment” and discernment , and this is certain proof of that. 
But such is life when you’re a Clinton. Look right into the camera and commence lying. This is how they roll.

CNN has severed its relationship with Democratic strategist Donna Brazile after it became clear that she was secretly sharing information about CNN events with Hillary Clinton’s presidential campaign. 
EDITOR’S NOTE: Debbie Wasserman-Schultz was fired when WikiLeaks revealed she was heading a covert operation to steal the nomination from Crooked Hillary, she was replaced by Donna Brazile . WikiLeaks then showed us that Donna Brazile was feeding the interview questions from CNN to Crooked Hillary before the interviews and town halls took place. CNN today made a formal announcement of the severing their relationship with Donna Brazile. We are watching the complete destruction of not only the Clinton Crime Machine but of the reputation of the DNC as well. 
“We are completely uncomfortable with what we have learned about her interactions with the Clinton campaign while she was a CNN contributor,” CNN spokeswoman Lauren Pratapas said in a statement, according to Politico . 
Brazile apparently emailed Clinton campaign staff leaked information about a CNN town hall in Flint, Michigan. Democrat Donna Brazile On Final Debate and Email Scandal: 
“One of the questions directed to HRC tomorrow is from a woman with a rash,” Brazile noted in the email . “Her family has lead poison and she will ask what, if anything, will Hillary do as president to help the ppl of Flint.” In March, Brazile emailed to warn the campaign about Clinton’s stance on the death penalty. 
“From time to time I get the questions in advance,” she wrote in the subject line, noting that she was worried about Clinton’s response. CNN’s Jake Tapper CONDEMNS DNC Chair DONNA BRAZILE

OBAMA GIVES TRUMP A GIFT: ObamaCare Collapsing Nationwide One Week Before Election Day,"  OBAMA GIVES TRUMP A GIFT: ObamaCare Collapsing Nationwide One Week Before Election Day A look at what happened in Arizona shows the cascading effects of problems with the design and implementation of the ACA, combined with early missteps by insurers. Some priced plans aggressively, angling for market share and betting special programs built into the law would protect them from losses. Those protections didn’t work as expected. Enrollees’ health-care expenses repeatedly overshot the projections of nearly all Arizona’s insurers. The result: a flood of red ink, then withdrawals and premium increases.   When Affordable Care Act insurance marketplaces launched in fall 2013, Arizona seemed like a success. Eight insurers competed to sign up consumers, offering a wide variety of plans and some of the lowest premiums in the country. 
Today, with ACA enrollment starting Nov. 1 , Arizonans will find in most counties only one insurer selling exchange plans for 2017. Premiums for some plans will be more than double this year, some of the biggest increases in the nation. Only last-minute maneuvering prevented one Arizona county from becoming the first in the nation to have no exchange insurers at all. 
A similar dynamic is playing out in other states’ exchanges, which are a critical centerpiece of the 2010 health law. About one-third of U.S. counties will have just one exchange insurer next year , up from 7% this year, estimates the nonprofit Kaiser Family Foundation, which studies health-care issues. In many cases, remaining insurers are seeking significant rate increases. Obama on Showing ACA Works: ‘We’re Not Going To Get That Much Help Through the Media’ 
A look at what happened in Arizona shows the cascading effects of problems with the design and implementation of the ACA, combined with early missteps by insurers. Some priced plans aggressively, angling for market share and betting special programs built into the law would protect them from losses. Those protections didn’t work as expected. Enrollees’ health-care expenses repeatedly overshot the projections of nearly all Arizona’s insurers. The result: a flood of red ink, then withdrawals and premium increases. 
“The Arizona market is the poster child for the problems the exchanges are experiencing nationally,” says Tom Snook, a Phoenix-based actuary for consultants Milliman Inc. 
Opponents of the health law have cited the problems in Arizona and other states to argue for unraveling the legislation, and they have proposed changes such as expanding health-savings accounts and allowing insurers to sell plans across state lines. Trump: My employees are having problems with Obamacare 
Obama administration officials say they are bolstering the exchanges, and the consumer impact of premium increases will be limited by the law’s subsidies for lower-income people, received by about 85% of enrollees nationally. “We’re making really good progress in addressing a lot of the issues,” says Kevin Counihan, head of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services unit charged with implementing the health law. He calls Arizona an “outlier,” saying that insurers elsewhere have succeeded with ACA plans. 
The ACA transformed the individual insurance market, where consumers buy their own plans. Before the law, insurers could refuse to sell to people with pre-existing health conditions. Starting in 2014, consumers couldn’t be denied coverage, or charged more, if they were ill. Individuals could shop for plans via an online marketplace. Partly to ensure that healthy people signed up to balance out the sick, the law contained penalties for most people if they didn’t obtain coverage. Arizona expanded Medicaid, as the law envisioned. 
Insurers saw uncertainty in the new marketplace, but also potential. They had to guess what prices they needed to charge to cover the health costs of new enrollees. A 2013 Society of Actuaries report suggested that the Arizona individual-insurance market could more than double, growing to 570,681 consumers, with more than 80% of them buying through the exchange. The health-care costs of the newer customer base would be around 22% higher than the old one, it suggested. President dodges blame for Obamacare premium increases 
Insurers believed they had protective guardrails —programs in the law to limit losses for companies that drew a lot of unhealthy, high-cost consumers. One insurer, Health Net Inc., told investors in November 2013 it could effectively pay out $1.20 in claims for each $1 it got in premiums and still break even with help from an ACA program called “risk corridors.” Some of Health Net’s Arizona products were among the lowest-priced in the country, according to Kaiser. 
Kim Walton, 62 years old, of Tempe, says his monthly insurance bill dropped by more than two-thirds compared with his pre-ACA plan, with help from a federal subsidy. Unlike his old plan, his new ACA insurance covered any costs tied to his pre-existing health conditions—he earlier had a hip replacement and suffered a broken neck. “It was perfect,” says Mr. Walton, who owns his own business. 
Krysti Horwitz of Phoenix steered clear of the exchange. Ms. Horwitz, 35, and her husband, who own an online-marketing business, were healthy. In 2013, they had a plan that she said cost them significantly less than a new ACA one would. They weren’t eligible for subsidies. They decided to keep what they had, an option the Obama administration authorized in late 2013. 
By spring of 2014, with the first year of the new ACA plans barely under way, insurers had to guess again at pricing. Rate requests for 2015 plans were due, though insurers still had scant information about who signed up. That was partly because federal officials extended the deadline for enrollment after technical problems with HealthCare.gov, the federal exchange being used in Arizona and many other states. 
One thing was already clear: Health Net’s low-price gambit had won huge market share. The company ended up with nearly 92,000 enrolled in individual plans in 2014, more than seven times its 2013 total, according to insurance-data firm Mark Farrah Associates’ Health Coverage Portal. 
That posed a challenge for rivals, including startup Meritus, one of the nonprofit cooperative plans launched under the ACA. Meritus drew only a few thousand consumers in 2014, and it needed to boost enrollment to sustain itself, according to Tom Zumtobel,the co-op’s former CEO, who took over in late 2014. 
Meritus worked to reduce its prices, and its rates came in below competitors’ in 2015. 
Once again that year, Arizona had some of the lowest exchange premiums in the U.S., and one of the most competitive marketplaces, with 11 insurers, according to the Kaiser data. Enrollment grew, particularly at Meritus, where it surged to about 48,000 in 2015, according to Mark Farrah Associates. 
On Oct. 1, 2015, insurers got a huge blow: Federal regulators announced the risk-corridor program, which many companies expected to limit their financial risk, would pay out only 12.6% of the amount expected . The program hadn’t taken in enough money from successful insurers to cover the requests of those with significant losses. 
For Meritus, it was “operationally devastating,” says Mr. Zumtobel. That Oct. 30, just two days before consumers were set to start buying their 2016 exchange plans, Arizona’s regulator put the co-op under supervision, barring it from selling new insurance policies. 
Remaining insurers began retrenching. The 2016 plans included more-limited networks of health-care providers. The total number of exchange insurers ticked down to eight, from 11, and premiums rose. “We started to see the cracks,” says Jerry Anderson, an insurance agent in Scottsdale, Ariz. 
Nearly all the Arizona individual business of exchange insurers plunged into the red, according to Mark Farrah Associates, the insurance-data firm. Health Net booked nearly $40 million in losses on its Arizona individual business in 2014, and another $39 million the following year, according to Mark Farrah Associates, when the insurer agreed to be acquired by Centene Corp. Blue Cross Blue Shield of Arizona, the biggest player in the state’s individual market, had priced less aggressively than Health Net but still saw steep losses. 
Based on regulatory filings, McKinsey & Co. estimated the insurance industry suffered cumulative losses of between 9% and 11% of premium revenue on individual plans last year. Only about one-quarter of insurers reported a profit on the business. 
In Arizona, insurers set their rates too low to cover their enrollees’ health expenses. There were fewer people than actuaries once projected, with about 203,000 choosing exchange plans during the enrollment period for this year. The share of enrollees who were healthy was smaller than companies projected, partly because the law’s penalties weren’t enough to prod them to enroll, insurers say. The unhealthy people who did sign up were more costly. Insurers say that some consumers appeared to be buying plans specifically when they had health needs. 
Blue Cross Blue Shield of Arizona’s ACA plans in 2014 were priced around 35% higher on average than its individual plans in 2013. “In hindsight, it wasn’t even close to enough,” says Jeff Stelnik, a senior vice president at the nonprofit. ACA-plan enrollees had medical costs around 250% higher on average than individual members before the health law, due partly to far higher prevalence of conditions such as diabetes, he says. 
Insurers began to bail out. On April 19, UnitedHealth Group Inc. said it would pull out of nearly all state ACA exchanges , including Arizona’s, for the next year amid growing losses. Others in Arizona retreated, including Blue Cross Blue Shield of Arizona and Health Net, which decided to pull out of the state’s most populous county, Maricopa, as well as adjacent Pinal, for 2017. On Aug. 15, Aetna Inc. announced it would leave most of its exchanges , including Arizona’s. Aetna’s decision created a crisis: Pinal County would have no exchange insurers for 2017. The void would short-circuit a central mechanism of the law, because consumers can get subsidies only through an ACA marketplace. 
The situation drew attention from Republicans critical of the ACA, including Arizona Sen. John McCain . He introduced a bill meant to “protect AZ from Obamacare collapse,” according to a press release. Obama administration officials said they believed the situation would be resolved. 
In September, Blue Cross Blue Shield of Arizona announced it would continue to sell exchange plans in Pinal next year after all. The decision came after state and federal regulators “expressed their concern for Pinal residents,” though the insurer made the call on its own, says Blue Cross’s Mr. Stelnik. 
Neighboring Maricopa County, the state’s most populous, also ended up with just one insurer—Centene, Health Net’s new parent, which announced Sept. 14 it would sell exchange plans there next year. Centene CEO Michael F. Neidorff says his company has a very different approach from Health Net, which he says “thought they would get the revenue, the growth,” and relied on ACA risk programs for protection. Centene said it expects to be profitable in Arizona, as it has been in other exchanges. 
That left only one county in Arizona, Pima, with more than one exchange insurer—it has two. There will be a few more options sold outside the exchange, to people who don’t get federal subsidies. 
Premium increases are steep, though the effect will be blunted for those who get subsidies. Blue Cross’s rates are up by an average of 51% from this year, Centene’s Health Net unit’s, by nearly 75%. 
Mr. Walton, the consumer who benefited from lower premiums at the start of the exchange, worries he won’t be able to find a plan that includes his primary-care physician and his cardiologist. “I don’t know what’s going to happen come November,” he says.  ",1
Pope Francis Signs Joint Statement With Lutheran World Federation Church For ‘Full Unity’,"NTEB Ads Privacy Policy Pope Francis Signs Joint Statement With Lutheran World Federation Church For ‘Full Unity’ The Joint Declaration was signed during the ecumenical prayer service held in Lund’s Lutheran Cathedral on the first day of the Pope’s visit to Sweden. by Geoffrey Grider October 31, 2016 Pope Francis and Bishop Mounib Younan, President of the Lutheran World Federation signed a Joint Statement on Monday in which Catholics and Lutherans pledged to pursue their dialogue in order to remove the remaining obstacles that hinder them from reaching full unity. 
“And I heard another voice from heaven, saying, Come out of her, my people, that ye be not partakers of her sins, and that ye receive not of her plagues.” Revelation 18:4 (KJV) 
EDITOR’S NOTE: On October 31, 1517, Martin Luther nailed his 95 Theses to the castle church door in Wittenberg, Germany, thus sparking the release of the captive Christian church from the Roman Whore of Babylon, the Catholic Vatican Church system. Exactly 499 years later – today – Pope Francis undid Martin Luther’s work and ensnares an all too willing Lutheran Church with the concordat you can read below. This is exactly what the book of Revelation warns us about, and it is both sad and sickening to see so many Christian denominations so eager and willing to bow before the Roman pope. 
They also stressed their commitment to common witness on behalf of the poor, the needy and the victims of injustice. The Declaration was signed during the ecumenical prayer service held in Lund’s Lutheran Cathedral on the first day of the Pope’s visit to Sweden. 
Please find below the full text of the Statement: JOINT STATEMENT 
on the occasion of the Joint Catholic-Lutheran Commemoration of the Reformation 
Lund, 31 October 2016 
«Abide in me as I abide in you. Just as the branch cannot bear fruit by itself unless it abides in the vine, neither can you unless you abide in me» (John 15:4). With thankful hearts 
With this Joint Statement , we express joyful gratitude to God for this moment of common prayer in the Cathedral of Lund, as we begin the year commemorating the five hundredth anniversary of the Reformation. Fifty years of sustained and fruitful ecumenical dialogue between Catholics and Lutherans have helped us to overcome many differences, and have deepened our mutual understanding and trust. At the same time, we have drawn closer to one another through joint service to our neighbours – often in circumstances of suffering and persecution. Through dialogue and shared witness we are no longer strangers. Rather, we have learned that what unites us is greater than what divides us. Moving from conflict to communion 
While we are profoundly thankful for the spiritual and theological gifts received through the Reformation, we also confess and lament before Christ that Lutherans and Catholics have wounded the visible unity of the Church. Theological differences were accompanied by prejudice and conflicts, and religion was instrumentalized for political ends. Our common faith in Jesus Christ and our baptism demand of us a daily conversion, by which we cast off the historical disagreements and conflicts that impede the ministry of reconciliation. While the past cannot be changed, what is remembered and how it is remembered can be transformed. We pray for the healing of our wounds and of the memories that cloud our view of one another. We emphatically reject all hatred and violence, past and present, especially that expressed in the name of religion. Today, we hear God’s command to set aside all conflict. We recognize that we are freed by grace to move towards the communion to which God continually calls us. Our commitment to common witness 
As we move beyond those episodes in history that burden us, we pledge to witness together to God’s merciful grace, made visible in the crucified and risen Christ. Aware that the way we relate to one another shapes our witness to the Gospel, we commit ourselves to further growth in communion rooted in Baptism, as we seek to remove the remaining obstacles that hinder us from attaining full unity. Christ desires that we be one, so that the world may believe (cf. John 17:21). Pope Francis has been working on this partnership for a long time: 
Many members of our communities yearn to receive the Eucharist at one table, as the concrete expression of full unity. We experience the pain of those who share their whole lives, but cannot share God’s redeeming presence at the Eucharistic table. We acknowledge our joint pastoral responsibility to respond to the spiritual thirst and hunger of our people to be one in Christ. We long for this wound in the Body of Christ to be healed. This is the goal of our ecumenical endeavours, which we wish to advance, also by renewing our commitment to theological dialogue. 
“And the woman was arrayed in purple and scarlet colour, and decked with gold and precious stones and pearls, having a golden cup in her hand full of abominations and filthiness of her fornication: And upon her forehead was a name written, MYSTERY, BABYLON THE GREAT, THE MOTHER OF HARLOTS AND ABOMINATIONS OF THE EARTH.” Revelation 17:4,5 (KJV) 
We pray to God that Catholics and Lutherans will be able to witness together to the Gospel of Jesus Christ, inviting humanity to hear and receive the good news of God’s redeeming action. We pray to God for inspiration, encouragement and strength so that we may stand together in service, upholding human dignity and rights, especially for the poor, working for justice, and rejecting all forms of violence. God summons us to be close to all those who yearn for dignity, justice, peace and reconciliation. Today in particular, we raise our voices for an end to the violence and extremism which affect so many countries and communities, and countless sisters and brothers in Christ. We urge Lutherans and Catholics to work together to welcome the stranger, to come to the aid of those forced to flee because of war and persecution, and to defend the rights of refugees and those who seek asylum. Pope Francis wants to absorb all of the Christianity, not just the Lutherans: 
More than ever before , we realize that our joint service in this world must extend to God’s creation, which suffers exploitation and the effects of insatiable greed. We recognize the right of future generations to enjoy God’s world in all its potential and beauty. We pray for a change of hearts and minds that leads to a loving and responsible way to care for creation. One in Christ 
On this auspicious occasion , we express our gratitude to our brothers and sisters representing the various Christian World Communions and Fellowships who are present and join us in prayer. As we recommit ourselves to move from conflict to communion, we do so as part of the one Body of Christ, into which we are incorporated through Baptism. We invite our ecumenical partners to remind us of our commitments and to encourage us. We ask them to continue to pray for us, to walk with us, to support us in living out the prayerful commitments we express today. Calling upon Catholics and Lutherans worldwide 
We call upon all Lutheran and Catholic parishes and communities to be bold and creative, joyful and hopeful in their commitment to continue the great journey ahead of us. Rather than conflicts of the past, God’s gift of unity among us shall guide cooperation and deepen our solidarity. By drawing close in faith to Christ, by praying together, by listening to one another, by living Christ’s love in our relationships, we, Catholics and Lutherans, open ourselves to the power of the Triune God. Rooted in Christ and witnessing to him, we renew our determination to be faithful heralds of God’s boundless love for all humanity. source SHARE THIS ARTICLE Geoffrey Grider NTEB is run by end times author and editor-in-chief Geoffrey Grider.

Last Minute Millions Pour In From Republican Donors As Donald Trump Surges Towards The Top,"NTEB Ads Privacy Policy Last Minute Millions Pour In From Republican Donors As Donald Trump Surges Towards The Top Billionaire Sheldon Adelson just committed $25 million to an anti-Hillary Clinton Super PAC to try and help tilt the presidential race and down ballot House and Senate races to Republicans, Fox News learned Monday. There are indications the casino magnate will pony up even more by the end of the week. by Geoffrey Grider October 31, 2016 Adelson pours $25 million into White House race, more may be coming 
Billionaire Sheldon Adelson just committed $25 million to an anti-Hillary Clinton Super PAC to try and help tilt the presidential race and down ballot House and Senate races to Republicans, Fox News learned Monday. There are indications the casino magnate will pony up even more by the end of the week. 
Two senior Republican sources familiar with the donation described it to Fox News as a “massive” amount of money to be spent during the final week of the presidential race and a sign that Adelson, who has largely been on the sidelines after initially suggesting he would give $100 million to help Donald Trump, is now going all in on the Republican nominee. GOP donors pouring-last minute money into the race: 
The money will benefit Future 45 , a Super PAC launched by the Ricketts family in Chicago, founders of TD Ameritrade. The group has recently been running a television ad in battlegrounds comparing Clinton to Richard Nixon, calling her a “secretive, paranoid politician who destroyed 30,000 pieces of evidence.” 
The Republican sources said the contribution was made in the last few days as the FBI re-ignited its investigation of Clinton’s email server, and could spark other big GOP donors – who may have thought the Democratic nominee was coasting to victory just days ago — to step up their support of Trump in the final days. 
Most importantly, one source familiar with the Adelson contribution revealed he is considering pouring as much as another $25 million dollars into the race before Election Day on November 8. 
The first major contribution came as Trump visited Adelson’s Venetian resort and casino in Las Vegas for a rally with supporters on Sunday. Trump praised Adelson and his wife, Miriam, without any reference to the money that went to the Super PAC. source SHARE THIS ARTICLE Geoffrey Grider NTEB is run by end times author and editor-in-chief Geoffrey Grider.

The Top 5 Conspiracy Theories That Were Proven To Be True Because Donald Trump Ran For President,"  The Top 5 Conspiracy Theories That Were Proven To Be True Because Donald Trump Ran For President Every election year, charges of favoritism in the media fly back and forth, this is as old as the Republic itself. But this year, conspiracy theorists have claimed that the MSM was not only in the bag for Crooked Hillary, but actively working to secure her election with false polls, false stories and rampant and illegal collusion with the candidate.   Thank you, WikiLeaks , for making this a memorable year for discovering the truth behind the power that controls our system. 
Historians will look back on the Presidential Election of 2016 as the, not “a”, but the turning point in American history for a variety of reasons. Not the least of which will be that, because Donald Trump ran and was attacked by such an army of haters, that the truth about so many things previously kept hidden was brought out into the open. So today we are happy to bring you: The Top 5 Conspiracy Theories Proven To Be True In 2016 THE BUSH FAMILY ARE PART OF THE NEW WORLD ORDER: Every since George H.W. Bush uttered his “ we will bring in a New World Order ” speech in 1991, conspiracy theorists has speculated that the Bush Crime Family were not really Republicans or even Conservatives, but globalists with a secret agenda. It took the nomination of Donald Trump as the Republican candidate for president to bring these worms out from under their rock. Not only have they opposed Trump, and refused to support the nominee of the party they claim to belong to, they are actively working to try and elect Crooked Hillary , globalist candidate for president. PROVEN TRUE. THE LIBERAL MAIN STREAM MEDIA IS CORRUPT: Every election year, charges of favoritism in the media fly back and forth, this is as old as the Republic itself. But this year, conspiracy theorists have claimed that the MSM was not only in the bag for Crooked Hillary , but actively working to secure her election with false polls , false stories and rampant and illegal collusion with the candidate . WikiLeaks, one of the best friends the truth has in America, exposed all that and more this election 2016. It showed that not only were the conspiracy theorists right, they didn’t go far enough in their speculations. PROVEN TRUE. THE DNC RIGGED THE DEMOCRATIC NOMINATION PROCESS: After candidate Bernie Sanders exhibited Trump-sized crowds everywhere he went, people were shocked when he was so easily beaten by Crooked Hillary who struggles to draw people to her rallies. As it turned out, the DNC was not only actively working to nominate Hillary , they were also actively working to suppress the momentum of Bernie Sanders. PROVEN TRUE. THE CLINTON FOUNDATION SOLD ACCESS TO THE STATE DEPARTMENT: For years now, conspiracy buffs have made the claim that the Clinton Crime Family, and Crooked Hillary sold access to the State Department for cash and favors. A book called Clinton Cash was even published documenting all this. But when WikiLeaks released emails proving this to be true and exposing the connections, it ceased to be a theory albeit remaining a conspiracy. PROVEN TRUE. GEORGE SOROS IS THE POWER BEHIND NEARLY ALL OF IT: George Soros real life history reads like a sordid crime novel. Born Jewish, he switched teams as a teenager in WWII and sided with the Nazis . This began a life of crime and intrigue that helped him amass an enormous fortune. Revelations in 2016 have showed Soros to be one of Hillary Clinton’s largest single donors , his orders were carried out by Crooked Hillary’s State Department, he funded the race riots which started in 2015, and he is behind massive voter fraud both here and around the world. If you go to vote and see a SmartMatic voting machine , immediately demand a paper ballot if you want your vote to be accurately recorded. George Soros is even the financial power behind the massive wave of Muslim migration in Europe. And the money behind Black Lives Matters as well. PROVEN TRUE. 
So thank you, WikiLeaks , for making this a memorable year for discovering the truth behind the power that controls our system. And thank you, Donald J. Trump, for having the courage to run this campaign, spending $100 million of your own money, and calling us to make America great, again. CNN Caught Covering Up Hillary Cheating at Debates: Gen.

Merkel’s Germany Descends Into Lawlessness As Muslim Migrants Rule The Streets With Impunity,"  Merkel’s Germany Descends Into Lawlessness As Muslim Migrants Rule The Streets With Impunity Germany has been hit by a spate of horrendous violent crime by Muslim migrants including rapes, sexual and physical assaults, stabbings, home invasions, robberies, burglaries and drug trafficking.   During the first six months of 2016, Muslim migrants committed 142,500 crimes, according to the German Federal Criminal Police Office. Germany has been hit by a spate of horrendous violent crime including rapes, sexual and physical assaults, stabbings, home invasions, robberies, burglaries and drug trafficking. Adding to the country’s woes is the fact that thousands of people have gone missing after travelling to the country on invitation from the country’s leader. Germany took in more than 1.1 million Muslim migrants in the past year and parts of the country are crippled with a lack of infrastructure. Now the true reality is hitting home ahead of next year’s elections as the far right surges in the polls threatening to topple the Christian Democratic Union (CDU) leader Mrs Merkel. According to a report by the international policy council the Gatestone Institute , local police in many parts of the country admit that they are stretched to the limit. The report states: “The rape of a ten-year-old girl in Leipzig, the largest city in Saxony, has drawn renewed attention to the spiraling levels of violent crime perpetrated by migrants in cities and towns across Germany. “During the first six months of 2016, migrants committed 142,500 crimes, according to the Federal Criminal Police Office. This is equivalent to 780 crimes committed by migrants every day, an increase of nearly 40 per cent over 2015. The data includes only those crimes in which a suspect has been caught. “Thousands of Muslim migrants who entered the country as ‘asylum seekers’ or ‘refugees’ have gone missing. They are, presumably, economic migrants who entered Germany on false pretenses. “Many are thought to be engaging in robbery and criminal violence.” According to Freddi Lohse of the German Police Union in Hamburg, many migrant offenders view the leniency of the German justice system as a green light to continue delinquent behavior, says the report. He said: “They are used to tougher consequences in their home countries. “They have no respect for us.” Meanwhile a female police officer has admitted that officers are under attack and that the courts are a “joke.” In a new book, Tania Kambouri, a German police officer, said: “For weeks, months and years I have noticed that Muslims, mostly young men, do not have even a minimum level of respect for the police. “When we are out patrolling the streets, we are verbally abused by young Muslims. source SHARE  ",1
Iran Sending Elite IRGC Warfighters Into Europe And United States In Preparation For Battle,"NTEB Ads Privacy Policy Iran Sending Elite IRGC Warfighters Into Europe And United States In Preparation For Battle Iranian military and government officials have continued to advocate violence against the U.S. and its allies, despite the nuclear deal and several secret side agreements that gave Iran $1.7 billion in cash. by Geoffrey Grider November 2, 2016 The Iranian Revolutionary Guards Corps, the country’s elite military force, is sending assets to infiltrate the United States and Europe at the direction of Iran’s Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei, according to recent Farsi-language comments from an Iranian military leader. 
EDITOR’S NOTE: This is just a small bit of what our next president will have to deal with. Do you want a president who needs to take naps all the time , or do you want a Commander in Chief who is awake, alert and highly energized to get the job done? It’s a no-brainer, people, go out and vote to #MakeAmericaSafeAgain. 
The IRGC “will be in the U.S. and Europe very soon,” according to the Iranian military commander, who said that these forces would operate with the goal of bolstering Iran’s hardline regime and thwarting potential plots against the Islamic Republic. 
“The whole world should know that the IRGC will be in the U.S. and Europe very soon,” Salar Abnoush, deputy coordinator of Iran’s Khatam-al-Anbia Garrison, an IRGC command front, was quoted as saying in an Iranian state-controlled publication closely tied to the IRGC. Iran’s secret army, the IRGC: 
The military leader’s comments come as Iran is spending great amounts of money to upgrade its military hardware and bolster its presence throughout the Middle East and beyond. Iran intends to spend billions to purchase U.S.-made planes that are likely to be converted for use in its air force. 
Congressional leaders and others suspect that Iran has used a large portion of the cash windfall it received as a result of last summer’s nuclear agreement to upgrade its fighting capabilities war machine. 
“The IRGC is [the] strong guardian of the Islamic Republic,” Abnoush was quoted as saying. “The Fedayeen of Velayat [fighting force] are under the order of Iran’s Supreme leader. Defending and protecting the Velayat [the Supreme Leader] has no border and limit.” Iranian military and government officials have continued to advocate violence against the U.S. and its allies, despite the nuclear deal and several secret side agreements that gave Iran $1.7 billion in cash. 
Iran accuses the U.S. of violating its end of the agreement by not helping the Islamic Republic gain further access to international banks and other markets. Iran’s frustration over this has led to further accusations about a U.S. plot to foster unrest in the country. Iran IRGC UAV & UCAV operation units in Persian Gulf: 
“Our enemies have several projects to destroy our Islamic revolution, and have waged three wars against us to execute their plans against our Islamic Republic,” Abnoush said. “The IRGC has defeated enemies in several fronts. The enemy surrendered and accepted to negotiate with us.” 
“And now all of our problems are being solved and our country is becoming stronger in all fronts. Some believe the holy defense ended,” the military leader added. “They are wrong; the holy defense continues, and today, it is more complicated than before.” 
Congressional sources and experts involved in tracking Iran’s increased aggression in the region and elsewhere told the Washington Free Beacon that these most recent comments are troubling given Iran’s very public efforts to assassinate political enemies and others across the globe. 
“If we look at Iran’s previous terror attacks and assassination campaign around the world, such a statement is alarming,” Saeed Ghasseminejad, an Iran expert at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies, told the Free Beacon . “The Islamic Republic has killed hundreds of Iranians and non-Iranians around the world in a coordinated campaign of terror. Iran may decide to restart the project now that many western companies are going to Iran and Iran feels its action in Europe may not be punished strongly.” 
Another source who advises congressional leaders on Iran sanctions issues told the Free Beacon that the Obama administration is blocking Congress from taking action to stop this type of infiltration by Iranian forces. 
“Iran is ideologically, politically, and militarily committed to exporting the Islamic revolution through terrorism, which is why even the Obama administration says they’re the world’s foremost state sponsor of terrorism,” the source said. “Congress wants to act, but Obama officials keep saying that new laws are unnecessary because the U.S. has enough tools to block Iranian terror expansion. Instead of using those tools, though, they’re sending Iran billions of dollars in cash while Iran plants terror cells in Europe and here at home.” source SHARE THIS ARTICLE Geoffrey Grider NTEB is run by end times author and editor-in-chief Geoffrey Grider.

"Donald Trump Will Be 70 Years, 7 Months And 7 Days Old On First Full Day In Office As President","NTEB Ads Privacy Policy Donald Trump Will Be 70 Years, 7 Months And 7 Days Old On First Full Day In Office As President On May 14, 2018, Israel will have been officially regathered, in fulfillment of Bible prophecy, for exactly 70 years. In 70 AD, Israel was destroyed by the Romans and the Temple stones toppled to the ground exactly as Jesus said it would happen. When you subtract 70 AD from 2018 AD, where does that leave you? It leaves you square in 1948 AD. Please pause here and allow that thought to sink in for a moment. by Geoffrey Grider November 3, 2016 God likes to orchestrate events relating to Israel around the number 70 
“In the first year of his reign I Daniel understood by books the number of the years , whereof the word of the LORD came to Jeremiah the prophet, that he would accomplish seventy years in the desolations of Jerusalem.” Daniel 9:2 (KJV) 
People, you better buckle up because things are about to become unglued. For well over a year now, we here at NTEB have been telling you that Donald Trump is God’s man for the White House, and that Bible prophecy would be fulfilled in the process. Two very eye-opening articles you need to read are The Real Reason Why Donald Trump Was Chosen To Be The Republican Candidate For President and Why A Bible Believer Is Supporting Donald Trump For President Of The United States . I wrote those articles on May 4 and February 13, respectively. Israel in general and Jerusalem in particular are God’s time clock for the fulfillment of Bible prophecy 
On our Sunday night radio show , which you can access here , we talked about Donald Trump, Bible prophecy and the coming global shaking. And believe me when I tell you it’s coming. In the 9th chapter of Daniel we see that he finally understands what Israel’s Babylonian captivity is all about by reading the prophecy Jeremiah had written. That was Daniel’s “a-ha!” moment. 
“And this whole land shall be a desolation, and an astonishment; and these nations shall serve the king of Babylon seventy years . And it shall come to pass, when seventy years are accomplished, that I will punish the king of Babylon, and that nation, saith the LORD, for their iniquity, and the land of the Chaldeans, and will make it perpetual desolations.” Jeremiah 25:11,12 (KJV) 
After digesting that bombshell , Daniel is then visited by the angel Gabriel who gives Daniel his own shocking prophecy of the Seventy Weeks Of Years. All of that prophecy has been fulfilled except the last week, or 7 year period, known as the time of Jacob’s trouble as found in the book of Jeremiah and mentioned by Jesus in Matthew 24 as the time of “great tribulation”. 
“Alas! for that day is great, so that none is like it: it is even the time of Jacob’s trouble; but he shall be saved out of it.” Jeremiah 30:7 (KJV) 
“For then shall be great tribulation, such as was not since the beginning of the world to this time, no, nor ever shall be.” Matthew 24:21 (KJV) 
On May 14, 2018, Israel will have been officially regathered , in fulfillment of Bible prophecy, for exactly 70 years. In 70 AD, Israel was destroyed by the Romans and the Temple stones toppled to the ground exactly as Jesus said it would happen. When you subtract 70 AD from 2018 AD, where does that leave you? It leaves you square in 1948 AD. Please pause here and allow that thought to sink in for a moment. 
Donald Trump was born on June 14, 1946. If you move ahead 70 years from that date, that brings you to June 14, 2016. Moving forward another seven months brings you to Jan. 14, 2017, and moving forward another seven days brings you to Jan. 21, 2017. This is happening in the year 5777 according to the Jewish calendar. 
And if Donald Trump wins the election , Jan. 21 will be his first full day in office. Of course Trump would be inaugurated on Jan. 20, but he would only be president for part of that day. So that means that Donald Trump would be 70 years, seven months and seven days old on his first full day as president of the United States . Please pause here as well, and allow that thought to sink in for a moment. 
All this brings us to our last point, and here it is. One of the many campaign promises that Donald Trump has made is that he will move the US Embassy in Israel from its current location in Tel Aviv, to its new location in Jerusalem in accordance with the Jerusalem Embassy Act of 1995 . By doing that, the United States will recognize Jerusalem as the capital of Israel, and thus set off the Psalm 83 War as found in the Bible. 
“They have said, Come, and let us cut them off from being a nation; that the name of Israel may be no more in remembrance. For they have consulted together with one consent: they are confederate against thee:” Psalm 83:4,5 (KJV) 
For it is Jerusalem, what the Bible calls the “apple of God’s eye”, that the real battle will be fought over. Why do you think that the Palestinians have always rejected the so-called Two State Solution? Because that solution calls for Jerusalem and the Temple Mount to stay with Israel, and the Muslims will not stand for that. They want Jerusalem for the same reason that the Antichrist fights the Battle of Armageddon for it. Because Jerusalem is where Jesus returns to, and where He will rule from for a thousand years. Jerusalem is the reason for all the conflict, all the fighting, all the past wars, and the coming war. 
“Behold, I will make Jerusalem a cup of trembling unto all the people round about, when they shall be in the siege both against Judah and against Jerusalem. And in that day will I make Jerusalem a burdensome stone for all people: all that burden themselves with it shall be cut in pieces, though all the people of the earth be gathered together against it.” Zechariah 12:2,3 (KJV) 
This election is going to usher in a time of amazing fulfillment of Bible prophecy. It is no coincidence of any kind that Donald Trump will be 70 years, 7 months and 7 days old on his first full day in office. It is not luck, fortune, happenstance or karma that he beat his 16 competitors for the nomination. As I have said for over a year now, Donald Trump is God’s man for “such a time as this”, and that we are living in the days of visible fulfillment of Bible prophecy. 
As we started our radio show on this topic on this past Sunday night, do you know what the headline story on the Jerusalem Post website was? It was this: Ivanka Trump says her father will move US embassy to Jerusalem ‘100%’ if elected 
If Donald Trump becomes President on Tuesday , as I believe with all my heart he will, then you better start thinking about the time of Jacob’s trouble beginning sometime on or around May of 2018. That means the Rapture of the Church will have to happen before that. Please pause here as well, and allow that thought to sink in for a moment. 
Are YOU ready for what comes next? Because, brothers and sisters, it sure looks like it’s coming.

Crooked Hillary Campaign Chairman John Podesta Took Part In Satanic Blood Rituals And Black Magic,"NTEB Ads Privacy Policy Crooked Hillary Campaign Chairman John Podesta Took Part In Satanic Blood Rituals And Black Magic The revelation that John Podesta, Hillary Clinton’s campaign chairman, is presumably interested in weird, gory occult ceremonies was too juicy for even Wikileaks to ignore. by Geoffrey Grider November 4, 2016 In what is undoubtedly the most bizarre Wikileaks revelation to date, Clinton campaign chairman John Podesta was invited to a “spirit cooking dinner” by performance artist Marina Abramovic, to take part in an occult ritual founded by Satanist Aleister Crowley. In an email dated June 28, 2015, Abramovic wrote, “I am so looking forward to the Spirit Cooking dinner at my place. Do you think you will be able to let me know if your brother is joining? All my love, Marina.” Tony Podesta then forwarded the email to his brother John Podesta (Hillary Clinton’s campaign chairman), asking him, “Are you in NYC Thursday July 9 Marina wants you to come to dinner.” What is “spirit cooking”? Spirit cooking refers to “a sacrament in the religion of Thelema which was founded by Aleister Crowley” and involves an occult performance during which menstrual blood, breast milk, urine and sperm are used to create a “painting”. The Podestas’“Spirit Cooking” dinner? It’s not what you think. It’s blood, sperm and breastmilk. 
— WikiLeaks (@wikileaks) November 4, 2016 According to Marina Abramovic , if the ritual is performed in an art gallery, it is merely art, but if the ritual is performed privately, then it represents an intimate spiritual ceremony. The video embedded above depicts the bizarre nature of the ceremony. Abramovic mixes together thickly congealed blood as the “recipe” for the “painting,” which is comprised of the words, “With a sharp knife cut deeply into the middle finger of your left hand eat the pain.” The ceremony is, “meant to symbolize the union between the microcosm, Man, and the macrocosm, the Divine, which is a representation of one of the prime maxims in Hermeticism “As Above, So Below.” Marina Abramovic ‘Spirit Cooking’: “Abramovic is known for her often-gory art that confronts pain and ritual. Her first performance involved repeatedly, stabbing herself in her hands. The next performance featured her throwing her nails, toenails, and hair into a flaming five-point star — which she eventually jumped inside of, causing her to lose consciousness,” writes Cassandra Fairbanks. Another image shows Abramovic posing with a bloody goat’s head – a representation of the occult symbol Baphomet. Spirit cooking is also an “occult practice used during sex cult rituals, as explained in the book “Spirit cooking with essential aphrodisiac recipes,” notes Mike Cernovich. The revelation that John Podesta, Hillary Clinton’s campaign chairman, is presumably interested in weird, gory occult ceremonies was too juicy for even Wikileaks to ignore. “The Podestas’ “Spirit Cooking” dinner? It’s not what you think. It’s blood, sperm and breastmilk. But mostly blood,” the organization tweeted. Some are even linking the spirit cooking revelation to claims that the Podesta emails contain “code for child sex trafficking” that is hidden behind mentions of types of food. Others are connecting it to Laura Silsby , the missionary who was jailed for six months after her organization, New Life Children’s Refuge, attempted to smuggle 33 children out of Haiti into the Dominican Republic after the 2010 Haiti earthquake. Significant, if partisan, find showing how the Clintons supported child stealer Laura Silsby https://t.co/7nULjOgmzr pic.twitter.com/NCgsVWTF2W 
— WikiLeaks (@wikileaks) November 3, 2016 Wikileaks emails reveal that Hillary’s top aide Huma Abedin forwarded numerous articles about New Life Children’s Refuge to Clinton. “Julian Assange claimed that the Wikileaks would send Hillary Clinton to prison,” writes Cernovich. “The releases initially disappointed many people, this reporter included, as the evidence of corruption was slim. Assange was right. The real story was hidden in view.” While the child trafficking and pedophile connections to Clinton remain unproven, the fact that her campaign chairman is apparently into spooky occult rituals involving menstrual blood and semen is easily one of the most disturbing Wikileaks revelations to date. source SHARE THIS ARTICLE Geoffrey Grider NTEB is run by end times author and editor-in-chief Geoffrey Grider.

One percent of the respondents said that they were supporting someone else, and five percent said they were still undecided. 
The survey , conducted by Strategic National , a Republican leaning consulting firm based in Michigan, contacted 573 likely voters in the State of Michigan on Nov. 3. The survey reported that 39 percent of the respondents were affiliated with the Democratic Party, 34 percent affiliated with the GOP, 21 percent affiliated with an independent or third party, and 5 percent said they were “unsure” of their party affiliation. Donald Trump MASSIVE Rally in Warren, Michigan: 
Clinton is scheduled to make an appearance in Detroit Friday afternoon. Clinton will attempt to inject enthusiasm into reliable Democratic Party voters that came out for President Barack Obama in full force both in 2008 and 2012. Trump appeared at two rallies in the state Monday, and his children, Donald Jr. and Ivanka stumped around the state this week. 
Texas Sen. Ted Cruz appeared at a campaign rally with vice presidential candidate Mike Pence Thursday in Portage, Mich. on the state’s west side — an area where Cruz and Ohio Gov. John Kasich performed well in the GOP primary. 
Both candidates have made “ six-figure ” advertising purchases in the state in the last days before the election. Clinton’s campaign dumped $2.5 million in Michigan in two days alone, according to tabloid news outlet TMZ . Laura Ingraham on Why Trump Can Pull Off an Election Upset Over Clinton on Tuesday: 
Clinton enjoyed as much as a 13-point advantage over Trump in Michigan just two weeks ago. The Democratic nominee has not made Michigan a regular campaign stop while Trump has focused on the state and other rust belt states as a potential path to victory. 
While Michigan hasn’t voted for a Republican candidate for president since President George H. W. Bush in 1988, the state is home to vast swaths of conservative-leaning precincts and a well-established state party apparatus. Michigan’s governor and both legislative chambers are controlled by Republicans and the state’s congressional delegation is made up of nine Republicans and five Democrats. 
Democrats have been able to win presidential elections by “running up the score” in its urban areas and population bases, something Clinton hoped would keep the state safely in her corner without diverting resources and time from other battleground states. 
“Trump is over performing in key segments of the electorate especially in rural areas and Macomb County while Clinton is failing to get the numbers she needs out of the city of Detroit,” John Yob, CEO of Strategic National, who conducted the poll, reported. 
Out of the poll’s respondents , 75 percent were contacted by landline, while 25 percent were contacted over cellular phone. The poll was conducted through landlines, using Interactive Voice Response and the margin of error for the poll is 4.09 percent. source

Southern Poverty Law Center Names Florida-Based Now The End Begins As ‘Active Anti Government Group’,"  Southern Poverty Law Center Names Florida-Based Now The End Begins As ‘Active Anti Government Group’ ""That whenever any Form of Government becomes destructive of these ends, it is the Right of the People to alter or to abolish it, and to institute new Government, laying its foundation on such principles and organizing its powers in such form, as to them shall seem most likely to effect their Safety and Happiness."" - Declaration of Independence   We are not against government , we are against bad government, oppressiv e government, corrupt government and anti-American government. 
“Let every soul be subject unto the higher powers. For there is no power but of God: the powers that be are ordained of God. Whosoever therefore resisteth the power, resisteth the ordinance of God: and they that resist shall receive to themselves damnation. For rulers are not a terror to good works, but to the evil. Wilt thou then not be afraid of the power? do that which is good, and thou shalt have praise of the same:” Romans 13:1-3 (KJV) 
This is what the Southern Poverty Law Center says about themselves on thier own website: “The SPLC is the premier U.S. non-profit organization monitoring the activities of domestic hate groups and other extremists – including the Ku Klux Klan , the neo-Nazi movement, neo-Confederates , racist skinheads , black separatists , antigovernment militias , Christian Identity adherents and others.” 
So it was with great amusement that I saw on page 60 of their yearly “ The Year In Hate And Extremism ” where they provide a state-by-state listing of anti government groups, Now The End Begins was included in their assessment of Florida. Hmmm…is NTEB really an “anti government” group? 
No, we are not. My father was a vet of both WWII and Korea, my brother a US Marine, and I have lots of friends who are warfighters, police officers and first responders. I was raised to have a deep and abiding respect for the police and government officials. I have never advocated for any uprising against our government, and certainly never advocated for violence on any level. That being said, NTEB is in 100% agreement with the following statement by founding father Thomas Jefferson: 
“That whenever any Form of Government becomes destructive of these ends, it is the Right of the People to alter or to abolish it, and to institute new Government, laying its foundation on such principles and organizing its powers in such form, as to them shall seem most likely to effect their Safety and Happiness.” – Declaration of Independence 
NTEB has been very hard on the Obama administration for reasons listed here , here and here . As well as here , here and here . And here . And oh, here , here and here , too. Ugh, enough already! A short Compilation of Barack Obama’s blatant lies: 
Now The End Begins is not “against government” , but we are against bad government, oppressiv e government, corrupt government and anti-American government. The Obama administration has been an 8 year experiment in white guilt, unvetted illegal immigration and a doubling of the National Debt just to name a few. Barack Obama is the anti-Reagan, a global citizen and the “ president of the world .” That’s not good government for America, that’s slop created for Socialists, Liberals and Communists by true anti-government troublemakers like Saul Alinsky . That’s not us, not by a long shot. Donald Trump: “My policy is America first” 
In 2016, America is presented with a fantastic opportunity to elect as leader, not a politician, but a businessman whose platform is simple. Put America first , and work to restore our former greatness. Wow, that’s exactly right. That’s a government that I can wholeheartedly support. That’s a government that the founding fathers would support. 
It’s time to Make America Great Again.

BOMBSHELL: Crooked Hillary Sent Classified Info To Chelsea Under Fake Name ‘Diane Reynolds’,"  BOMBSHELL: Crooked Hillary Sent Classified Info To Chelsea Under Fake Name ‘Diane Reynolds’ But perhaps the most significant part of the email is that Clinton forwarded classified information to her daughter, who is and was a private citizen with no government role and no apparent security clearances. It is unclear when or why Clinton deleted the email.   Crooked Hillary Clinton deleted a 2009 email in which she forwarded classified information to her daughter, Chelsea. 
EDITOR’S NOTE: The State Department today released recovered emails from Crooked Hillary’s illegal private email server, and guess what? It contained classified and confidential information. Who did she send it to? She sent it to her daughter, who was no clearance or authorization of any kind to view or receive such communications. Now do you see why Crooked Hillary deleted those 33,000 emails so no one could see them (she thought)? And oh, by the way, Chelsea used the fake name of Diane Reynolds to receive the illegally -sent emails. Think they knew they were breaking the law? Yep. 
The email was released on Friday by the State Department. It is one of thousands of emails recovered by the FBI from Clinton’s private email server. 
The Dec. 20, 2009 email chain , entitled “Update,” started with a message from Michael Froman, who served as a deputy assistant to President Obama and deputy national security adviser for international economic affairs. 
The email, which is redacted because it contains information classified as “Confidential,” was sent to Jake Sullivan, Clinton’s foreign policy adviser at the State Department, and several Obama aides. Sullivan sent it to Hillary Clinton who then forwarded it to Chelsea, who emailed under the pseudonym “Diane Reynolds.” 
All of the text in the body portion of the classified emails is redacted because it contains foreign government information. 
The State Department labeled the email a “near duplicate,” indicating that it was mostly similar to other emails that the agency has released from the trove of emails that Clinton turned over in Dec. 2014. Clinton did not delete other responses she made to others on the email thread. 
“Wow — you can’t make this up — sorry to have missed all of that! Let me know if you learn anything else,” she wrote to Sullivan. The State Department released that portion of the email conversation in February. CHELSEA CLINTON USED THE PSEUDONYM OF ‘DIANE REYNOLDS’ TO RECEIVE ILLEGAL EMAILS 
But perhaps the most significant part of the email is that Clinton forwarded classified information to her daughter, who is and was a private citizen with no government role and no apparent security clearances. 
It is unclear when or why Clinton deleted the email. She gave the State Department around 30,000 emails she claimed were related to her State Department work. She deleted a similar number claiming they were personal and dealt with yoga routines, food recipes and Chelsea’s wedding. 
FBI director James Comey said in July that investigators recovered several thousand work-related emails from Clinton’s server. The batch of emails released Friday are from that recovered trove. source

Hillary Supporters Jay-Z And Beyonce Are Members Of Aleister Crowley’s Satanic Cult OTO,"NTEB Ads Privacy Policy Hillary Supporters Jay-Z And Beyonce Are Members Of Aleister Crowley’s Satanic Cult OTO Other celebrities linked to OTO include the rapper Jay-Z, who has repeatedly purloined imagery and quotations from Crowley’s work. Whether wearing a T-shirt emblazoned with ‘Do what thou wilt’ or hiring Rihanna to hold aloft a flaming torch in his music videos (a reference to the Illuminati, an outlawed secret society whose name supposedly derives from Lucifer, or ‘light bringer’), he has given the sect priceless publicity. by Geoffrey Grider November 5, 2016 Aleister Crowley, who was born into an upper-class British family in 1875, styled himself as ‘the Great Beast 666’. He was an unabashed occultist who, prior to his death in 1947, revelled in his infamy as ‘the wickedest man in the world’. 
“And he was withdrawn from them about a stone’s cast, and kneeled down, and prayed, Saying, Father, if thou be willing, remove this cup from me: nevertheless not my will, but thine, be done.” Luke 22:41,42 (KJV) 
His form of worship involved sadomasochistic sex rituals with men and women, spells which he claimed could raise malevolent gods and the use of hard drugs, including opium, cocaine, heroin and mescaline. 
Crowley’s motto — perpetuated by OTO ( Ordo Templi Orientis ), — was ‘do what thou wilt’. And it is this individualistic approach that has led to a lasting fascination among artists and celebrities. Led Zeppelin’s Jimmy Page, for example, routinely took part in occult magical rituals and was so intrigued by Crowley he bought his former home, Boleskine House, on the shores of Loch Ness in Scotland. And there are now OTO lodges scattered around the country, practising the same ceremonial rituals and spreading the word of Crowley. Jay-Z and Beyonce are leading the way 
Other celebrities linked to OTO include the rapper Jay-Z , who has repeatedly purloined imagery and quotations from Crowley’s work. Whether wearing a T-shirt emblazoned with ‘Do what thou wilt’ or hiring Rihanna to hold aloft a flaming torch in his music videos (a reference to the Illuminati , an outlawed secret society whose name supposedly derives from Lucifer, or ‘light bringer’), he has given the sect priceless publicity. 
His clothing line , Rocawear , is shot through with OTO imagery such as the ‘all seeing eye’ in a triangle, the ‘eye of Horus’ (an ancient Egyptian symbol frequently referenced in occult texts) and the head of Baphomet (the horned, androgynous idol of Western occultism). Beyoncé Knowles admits demon possession by Sasha Fierce: 
Some conspiracy theorists have seized on this as evidence that he is a member of a secret Masonic movement which they believe permeates the highest levels of business and government. Others take a more pragmatic view: that it is commercial opportunism, cashing in on impressionable teens’ attraction to the ‘edginess’ of occult symbolism. Yet OTO is much more than a marketing opportunity for attention-seeking celebs. It is a living religion, with adherents still practising occult rituals set out by Crowley in his books. 
This week I tracked down John Bonner, 62, the head of OTO in the UK, to his home in East Sussex. He told me: ‘We are not a mass-appeal sort of organisation — in the UK we number in our hundreds. Worldwide it’s thousands. Hillary Clinton gets in formation with Jay Z and Beyonce: 
Celebrities are not always a boon or a benefit. ‘We are used to being misunderstood. Many stories about Crowley, like people saying he filed his teeth down into fangs, are nonsense. 
‘YOU COULD CALL US A SEX CULT IN A WAY, BECAUSE WE RECOGNISE, ACCEPT AND ADORE THE WHOLE PROCESS WHICH GOES TOWARDS MAKING TANGIBLE THE PREVIOUSLY INTANGIBLE.’ According to adherents of OTO it takes years of study before you can begin to understand what the religion is about — much like the equally controversial Church of Scientology. 
A former FBI agent , Ted Gundersen, who investigated Satanic circles in LA, found that Crowley’s teachings about ‘raising demons to do one’s bidding’ suggested human sacrifice, preferably of ‘an intelligent young boy’. 
John Bonner is dismissive of any idea that he and his fellow believers would even begin to countenance such excesses, pointing out that his is the only religion that sends people a letter of congratulations when they decide to leave (‘because they are exercising free will, which is what we’re all about’). 
But he accepts many people may not be able to deal with Crowley’s complex teachings. 
‘You’re not supposed to just jump straight in to it. It takes time and study, but our rituals are not for public consumption. You need to join us and go through the initiation process before you can begin to understand. ‘But according to our beliefs we can’t turn anyone away. So if you are over 18, are passably sane and are free to attend initiations, then you have an undeniable right of membership.’ source SHARE THIS ARTICLE Geoffrey Grider NTEB is run by end times author and editor-in-chief Geoffrey Grider.

Black Americans Going For Donald Trump In Record Numbers As Election Day Approaches,"NTEB Ads Privacy Policy Black Americans Going For Donald Trump In Record Numbers As Election Day Approaches Donald Trump is gaining in Michigan partly because many African-American voters — especially younger voters who backed Sen. Bernie Saunders — distrust Clinton, said Wayne Bradley, state director of African-American engagement for the Michigan Republican Party. by Geoffrey Grider November 5, 2016 Donald Trump is on track to double Gov. Mitt Romney’s support among African-American voters, according to a series of state polls. In 2012, African-Americans comprised a record 13 percent of all voters. President Barack Obama was reelected with 93 percent of the African-American vote, leaving Gov. Mitt Romney with only 6 percent of the African-American vote. Obama is now campaigning against Trump, and hoping to keep his share of the African-American vote below the 11 percent that George W. Bush won in 2004 during the housing bubble. On Friday , a poll of 506 Pennsylvania voters by Harper Polling showed Trump has the support of 18.46 percent of African-Americans. That’s eight points more than Romney’s share of the national vote in 2012, and if it proves true during the ballot, that 18.46 percent African-American support translates into 2 point shift towards Trump. The poll also said another 4.6 percent were undecided. Trump acknowledges ‘Blacks for Trump’ supporters: The Harper poll is small , with an error margin of 4.4 percent, but an Oct. 30 poll of 1,249 likely voters in Pennsylvania showed Trump has 19 percent support among African Americans, while another 7 percent remain undecided. That poll has a error margin of 2.77 percent. In next-door Michigan, two nights of a tracking poll conducted for Fox 2 of 1,150 likely voters showed Trump with 14 percent support and 19 percent support, leaving Clinton with 83 percent and 79 percent support. That’s equivalent to a two-point shift from Clinton to Trump in the state. “We’re showing Donald Trump doing far better among African-Americans than any other Republican in modern memory, said John Yob, CEO of a Michigan-based polling firm, Strategic National . Trump “has done an excellent job in campaigning for the votes of African-Americans,” he said, partly by campaigning in Detroit, said Yob, whose automated tracking polls show Trump and Clinton running level in the state. Black Trump Supporters Explain Why They are Voting for Donald Trump: Donald Trump is gaining in Michigan partly because many African-American voters — especially younger voters who backed Sen. Bernie Saunders — distrust Clinton, said W ayne Bradley, state director of African-American engagement for the Michigan Republican Party. “T here is a tremendous trust deficit with Hillary Clinton” because tough anti-crime laws established when her husband was president in the 1990s, he said. That distrust has helped cause a sharp drop in the number of absentee ballots mailed in from Detroit, even as other part of the state send in more ballots that before, Bradley said. Faced with a low turnout, the Clinton campaign is trying to frighten African-Americans to vote, but “t hat’s not a convincing enough argument,” he said. “Detroit as of Wednesday had seen absentee ballots returns equaling just 46 percent of the total 2012 absentee vote in the city, and the city clerk’s office is forecasting a decline of 10,000 absentee ballots compared to 2012, a fall of 12.5 percent,” according to a review of absentee records by the Gongwer.com website, which intensively tracks Michigan politics. It is “possible that the falloff portends reduced [election day] voting at the precincts, in which case … Clinton could net something like 32,000 fewer votes out of the city than President Barack Obama did in 2012.” But other polls offer better news to Clinton. A Detroit Free Press poll of 600 likely Michigan voters released Nov. 4 showed that “Among black voters, her margin also grew substantially, to 92% compared to 88% two weeks ago.” National Trends Trump’s gain among African-American voters is happening in many states, alongside an overall reduction in African-American enthusiasm and support for Obama’s designated successor. That drop-off in support from Obama’s 93 percent level will likely reduce the turnout for Clinton. MSNBC reporter wasn’t expecting Black Americans to vote for Trump: That’s a problem for Democrats, because a 7.5 percent drop in nationwide African-American turnout would be equal to a one-point drop in a nationwide vote for Clinton. Reports say the early-voting turnout by African-Americans has dropped by up to 10 percent in North Carolina and by somewhat less in Florida . President Barack Obama and other top Democrats have hopscotched through the states to push that turnout back up by election day. But pollsters face problems when trying to gauge opinions in a high-stakes emotional competition. For example, a large slice of African-Americans are picking “undecided” in some polls. The Washington Post is reporting that Clinton is leading Trump by 79 percentage points among African-Americans, but the fine print in the article says Clinton’s score is 82 percent and Trump’s score is 3 percent — leaving 15 percent who did not pick either candidate. So if Trump gets just one-in-five of the undecided African-American voters, he reaches Romney’s 2012 level. Blacks for Trump, It’s a Thing: Some concerned people lie to pollsters. For example, roughly 7 percent of college grads hide their support for Trump when they’re ask by pollsters over the phone, perhaps out of fear of penalties if their choice was made public. So when polls show a non-answer from respondents, for example, many undecided voters, the votes may be hiding a weak or strong preference for Trump. These factor may be impacting polls of African-Americans, who are being hammered by claims from Clinton and Obama that Trump is supposedly a racist. “If you accept the support of Klan sympathizers — the Klan — and hesitate when asked about that support, then you’ll tolerate that support when you’re in office,” Obama told an African-American crowd in North Carolina on Nov. 3. For example, Public Policy Polling — which mostly works for Democratic clients — used phone interviews in a poll that showed Trump with just 9 percent support in Michigan among 957 likely voters, of whom 12 percent were African-American. The poll said none of the roughly 110 African-Americans were undecided in a two-person race, even though 8 percent said they were unsure when they were asked if they had a favorable view of Trump. In contrast, the Harper Polling survey in Pennsylvania got very different answers from African-Americans. Trump got 18.5 percent support in a four-person race, although many respondents waffled when they were asked to pick between just Clinton and Trump. When asked to pick either of the two main candidates, only 12.3 percent supported Trump, while 13.9 percent declared themselves to be undecided. So Trump actually picked up half of the undecideds when the respondents were allowed to chose from the four candidates. Polls A national poll by TIPP showed Clinton at only 75 percent support among all non-whites, including Hispanics, African-Americans and Latinos. That poll showed Trump getting support from 15 percent of non-whites , leaving 5 percent undecided and 5 percent supporting other candidates. In North Carolina, 19 percent of African-Americans support Trump, according to an Oct. 30 survey of 1176 likely voters by Remington Research Group. An Oct. 28 to Oct. 31 poll in North Carolina by SurveyUSA showed Trump with 14 percent support in a poll of 800 adults, including 659 likely voters. African-Americans comprised 21 percent of the voters in the poll. SurveyUSA is the top-ranked pollster in Nate Silver’s rankings . But a late October poll of African-Americans in North Carolina by Siena University showed 89 percent support for Clinton and 1 percent for Trump — but it also showed 6 percent staying they did not know who they will vote for, and 11 percent support for the GOP Gov. Pat McCrory. In Florida, a Siena University poll showed that Trump had the support of 13 percent of African-Americans. More ominously for Clinton, she had the support of only 83 percent, while 4 percent said they didn’t know who to vote for. If Trump gets one-quarter of the 4 percent, he reaches 14 percent of the African-American vote, leaving Clinton with roughly 86 percent. In Virginia, a survey by Public Policy Polling taken in Nov. 3 and Nov. 4 showed Trump with 9 percent support and Clinton with 91 percent support. A Remington Research automated poll of 1,106 likely voters in Virginia showed Trump with 19 percent , and Clinton with just 78 percent support. In Georgia, a Nov. 2 to Nov. 3 poll of 1,000 likely voters showed Trump with 12 percent of the African-American vote, leaving Clinton with 85 percent. Amid the disagreement, rivalries and complexity, Bradley is confident that Trump will do well among African-Americans. His final tally as the GOP candidate “will be a higher number that it has been in the past… [because] he’s working, he’s coming to these cities to deliver the message.” The African-American vote may even be enough to help push Trump over the so-called “blue wall” of Democratic northern states that stands in his path to the White House. source SHARE THIS ARTICLE Geoffrey Grider NTEB is run by end times author and editor-in-chief Geoffrey Grider.

Two audience members told DailyMail.com that they had seen the man holding a firearm. That has not been confirmed by law enforcement. As police and good Samaritans took him down, the crowd surged backward and strained against the press section. ‘CNN sucks!’ one man yelled. ‘You people caused this!’ Audience members at the front of the crowd reportedly said they saw the man raise up a sign before a scuffle ensued. Saturday’s incident marked the second time Secret Service had to intervene to get Trump out of harm’s way. In March a man leaped over a police barricade during a Trump rally at an airport hangar in Dayton, Ohio. The man,Thomas Dimassimo, was charged with disorderly conduct and inciting panic, but he never reached the stage. Secret Service tackled him when he was still several yards away from the candidate. ‘I was ready for him, but it’s much easier if the cops do it, don’t we agree?’ Trump said at the time. ‘And to think I had such an easy life! What do I need this for, right?’ At this time a motive is not clear. source  ",1

For centuries, the Catholic Church had locked up the Bible and kept it out of reach of the common man. As a result, when the Protestant Reformation ended the Dark Ages and removed the Bible from its Vatican shackles, it was a book that remained quite a mystery to most people. Out of all of its 66 books, the most misunderstood, most debated over and most feared book is, ironically and undoubtedly, the book of Revelation. 
On this episode of Rightly Dividing , we apply Paul’s command to “rightly divide” to the book of Revelation, and in the process of doing so remove much of the mystery in the process. God didn’t write any part of the Bible to be out of reach of anyone who, by faith, wanted to plumb its depths and unlock its mysteries.

Stay abreast of the latest developments from nation’ source Jill Stein agrees with Donald Trump, Crooked Hillary must be stopped “Get ready for war with Russia” if Hillary Clinton is elected president, said progressive Green Party presidential nominee Jill Stein.“This election, we are not only deciding what kind of world we will have, but whether we will have a world or not going forward,” Stein warned, explaining that Clinton’s trigger-happy militarism “is a mushroom cloud waiting to happen.”While Stein explained that the dangers posed by a Clinton presidency are “arguably even more immediate and intense.”, Stein blasted Clinton’s “warmongering” that “almost singlehandedly” brought us the turmoil in Libya and could lead us into a nuclear war if Clinton were elected president. source Hillary Loses The Left While Donald Trump has been consolidating his base of support, the opposite appears to be happening for Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton, who seems to be hemorrhaging supporters from her progressive base.Clinton’s long-running rift with the progressive left has been a vulnerability for her throughout her campaign — dating back to the Democratic primary.Yet, in the closing days of the 2016 campaign, the rift has been laid bare through a combination of WikiLeaks revelations, a series of high-profile endorsements for Green Party presidential nominee Jill Stein from progressives like Marc Lamont Hill, Cornel West, and Susan Sarandon, as well as polling data that suggests Trump’s broad populist messaging is resonating with Democrat-leaning voters.Contrary to the narrative perpetuated by corporate media, many prominent liberals are now expressing their belief that installing Hillary Clinton, a “ corporatist hawk ,” in the White House is “ the true danger ” and would be “ more dangerous ” for progressive values, the well-being of the nation, and the stability of the world than would four years of a Donald Trump presidency. source Trey Gowdy Reaction to James Comey Final Conclusion on New Hillary Emails:

"As Her Electoral College Numbers Begin To Fall, Crooked HIllary Calls Off Election Night Fireworks","NTEB Ads Privacy Policy As Her Electoral College Numbers Begin To Fall, Crooked HIllary Calls Off Election Night Fireworks The campaign called the Coast Guard last week to tell them the event was off, three days after the New York Post reported it was planning the bash - although the cancellation was secret until Monday. It emerged as fresh projections of the electoral college showed she has lost the iron grip pollsters believed she had on the 270 college votes needed for victory. by Geoffrey Grider November 7, 2016 Hillary Clinton’s campaign has called off its planned election night fireworks display, it emerged Monday, the day before America goes to the polls. Staffers were going to put on a two-minute show over the Hudson River after the results come in on Tuesday, but the proposal has been canned, TMZ reported on Monday. The campaign called the Coast Guard last week to tell them the event was off, three days after the New York Post reported it was planning the bash – although the cancellation was secret until Monday. It emerged as fresh projections of the electoral college showed she has lost the iron grip pollsters believed she had on the 270 college votes needed for victory. CNN has moved Ohio, Utah and one district of Maine from toss-up to leaning Republican, and New Hampshire from leaning Democratic to toss-up. That changes the math significantly for Clinton, putting her projected total at 268 and Trump’s at 204 – with the rest of the votes to be fought over. 10 Things You Didn’t Know About Hillary Clinton: Until now she had been above 270. Fox News has changed its projection too, making Utah and North Carolina toss-ups, rather than leaning towards Clinton, while Arizona and Iowa move to leaning Republican. And a series of other measures pointed to a far tighter race than some pundits had predicted. In Florida, early voting figures obtained by the Drudge Report suggested Trump was doing better than Mitt Romney, and Hillary Clinton was under-performing Barack Obama in 2012. Similarly, Drudge reported that North Carolina had seen Trump exceed early voting expectations. The figures showed Trump behind be 305,000 when Romney was behind by 447,000 – a deficit which he still won the state from. The cancellation of the fireworks emerged three days after FBI director James Comey told Congress his agency was investigating a trove of emails found on the laptop of Anthony Weiner, husband of Clinton aide Huma Abedin. The cancellation was made Thursday – before Comey wrote again to Congress to say that the FBI had not found anything to justify changing its verdict of no charges to the Democrat about her use of a private email server while she was secretary of state. Still, Clinton’s campaign suffered collateral damage in the nine days which elapsed between the letters. source

Hillary Clinton Appears Disoriented And Confused At New York Airport Day Before Presidential Election,"  Hillary Clinton Appears Disoriented And Confused At New York Airport Day Before Presidential Election A few seconds later, her handlers become aware that she's having a Parkinson's freeze moment, and immediately swarm around her pushing the video cameras backwards. But not before video of her is recorded showing she doesn't know what she's supposed to do.   After Hillary Clinton posed for photos with the media covering her, she was confused about whether she needed to board the awaiting plane or get in the motorcade that had just dropped her off. 
Hillary Clinton was at the White Plains, New York airport about to start her day, when she exhibited some startling behavior . It was the very beginning of her day, so presumably she was rested and alert as she prepared to hit the campaign trail. Yet when speaking with the loud mob of reporters, she appeared to speak gibberish mixed in with her sentences, and laughing awkwardly even though nothing funny was being said. Then it got really weird. Shocking Video Footage Of A Confused Hillary Clinton Mumbling Gibberish On Campaign Trail 
As she walks in the direction of her personal campaign plane, she suddenly freezes and is not sure whether she needs to get into the motorcade which had just dropped her off, or board the plane like she was supposed to do. 
A few seconds later , her handlers become aware that she’s having another Parkinson’s freeze moment , and immediately swarm around her pushing the video cameras backwards. But not before video of her is recorded showing she doesn’t know what she’s supposed to do. Hillary’s Health: More than just a cough 
The cameras capture her saying “where am I going”? and then “what am I doing”? before she disappears into the protective huddle of her watchers. 
This stands is very stark contrast to am energized Donald Trump, making nearly a dozen stops in a 24 hour period and speaking for almost an hour wherever he goes. Hillary Clinton barely has the energy to get out of her car, and when she does get out, she has no idea what to do after that. 
This deceitful woman is not only hiding her crimes and scandals , she and her people are also hiding the fact that she is very ill and physically unfit to serve for 4 years as president of the United States. SHARE THIS ARTICLE  ",1
JUDGMENT DAY: The One Reason Why Every Christian And Jew In America Should Vote For Donald Trump,"  JUDGMENT DAY: The One Reason Why Every Christian And Jew In America Should Vote For Donald Trump The Jerusalem Embassy Act of 1995 is a public law of the United States passed by the 104th Congress on October 23, 1995. It was passed for the purposes of initiating and funding the relocation of the Embassy of the United States in Israel from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem.   8, 2016 Jerusalem will be the portal through which God administers His Justice to a depraved world. Jerusalem will be His “burdensome stone” with which He judges the world. 
“The lot is cast into the lap; but the whole disposing thereof is of the LORD.” Proverbs 16:33 (KJV) 
As Americans who love this country, it is absolutely crystal-clear who we should vote for. Only one candidate’s campaign slogan is Make America Great Again, only one candidate says that they will # DrainThe Swamp . I think you get the idea. But you can be a patriotic America and not be a Christian, right? Trump: It’s Time To Drain The Swamp In Washington, D.C – Five-Point Plan For Ethics Reform So is the a compelling, overarching reason why a Bible believing Christian should vote for Donald Trump? Yes, there is 
Donald Trump has made as part of his platform a promise to move the American Embassy from its current location in Tel Aviv to its new location in Jerusalem. In fact, it was signed into law in 1995, read this: 
The Jerusalem Embassy Act of 1995 is a public law of the United States passed by the 104th Congress on October 23, 1995. It was passed for the purposes of initiating and funding the relocation of the Embassy of the United States in Israel from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem , no later than May 31, 1999, and attempted to withhold 50 percent of the funds appropriated to the State Department specifically for “Acquisition and Maintenance of Buildings Abroad” as allocated in fiscal year 1999 until the United States Embassy in Jerusalem had officially opened. The act also called for Jerusalem to remain an undivided city and for it to be recognized as the capital of the State of Israel. Israel’s declared capital is Jerusalem, but this is not internationally recognized, pending final status talks in the Israeli–Palestinian conflict . The United States has withheld recognition of the city as Israel’s capital. The proposed law was adopted by the Senate (93–5),and the House (374–37). 
Contained in the Jerusalem Embassy Act is a prophecy bombshell , perhaps when you skimmed through it just now you missed so let me break it out for you, ready? 
“…called for Jerusalem to remain an undivided city and for it to be recognized as the capital of the State of Israel. 
Now please pause at this juncture and think about what that means for a Bible believer. Do you know why the Palestinians have, for 20 years, refused to accept the so-called Two State Solution ? Because the Two State Solution does not give Jerusalem to Palestine, it gives it to its rightful owner, Israel. The Battle of Armageddon will be fought over who will gain control of, not just Israel in general, but the rights to Jerusalem in particular! The word “Jerusalem” appears 811 times in your King James Bible, think that God places a lot of importance on it? 
“Behold, I will make Jerusalem a cup of trembling unto all the people round about, when they shall be in the siege both against Judah and against Jerusalem.” Zechariah 12:2 (KJV) 
God says if you go against His city of Jerusalem that it will mean “lights out” for you. Jerusalem will be the portal through which God administers His Justice to a depraved world. Jerusalem will be His “burdensome stone” with which He judges the world. 
“And in that day will I make Jerusalem a burdensome stone for all people: all that burden themselves with it shall be cut in pieces, though all the people of the earth be gathered together against it.” Zechariah 12:3 (KJV) NTEB PRESENTS: Donald Trump, Jerusalem and Bible Prophecy 
We just launched a YouTube channel for Bible teaching and prophecy, and here is our very first video of our radio show on Donald Trump and Jerusalem. Please subscribe to our YouTube channel by clicking here , thank you! 
Bible believers, let’s be honest. God is not really so much concerned with any election in any nation so much as He is with His nation of Israel and its capital city of Jerusalem. That’s where God’s passion is, that’s where His heart is. Genesis says that if you want God’s blessing, then bless His nation of Israel and bless His chosen people, the Jews. 
“And I will bless them that bless thee, and curse him that curseth thee: and in thee shall all families of the earth be blessed.” Genesis 12:3 (KJV) Christian, do you need a reason from the Bible to vote for Donald Trump? 
I just gave you two, very powerful and very Biblical reasons to vote for Donald Trump. He will move the US Embassy to Jerusalem, and he will love Israel and God will bless us for that. Now, get up, put your “big boy” and “big girl” pants on, and go out and vote . 
Not for the “lesser of two evils” as some erroneously assert, but for the only candidate that will fulfill Bible prophecy

"To The Hollywood And DC Liberals Who Said They Would Move If Trump Won, Your Train Is Outside","NTEB Ads Privacy Policy To The Hollywood And DC Liberals Who Said They Would Move If Trump Won, Your Train Is Outside Liberal rape hoaxer Lena Dunham told Andy Cohen at the Matrix Awards that “I know a lot of people have been threatening to do this, but I really will. I know a lovely place in Vancouver.” The star and creator of HBO’s “Girls” has been a vocal advocate for Hillary Clinton, the Democratic nominee. by Geoffrey Grider November 9, 2016 Dozens of celebrities vowed to leave the country if Donald Trump won the White House, saying they’d flee to everywhere from Canada to Jupiter. 
EDITOR’S NOTE: One of the great blessings of Trump’s campaign is that he exposed all the fakers, and phonies, pretend Republicans and wealthy, global elites who have been milking this country dry while actively working against it. Now we, the American people, humbly ask you to keep your promised to leave the country if your candidate lost. She did. Now get out. You’re with her, right? 
The threat is a common one after any election outcome: Canada’s immigration website crashed from heavy traffic as it looked increasingly likely that Donald Trump would win. But after the real estate mogul clinched the presidency in a stunning victory early Wednesday morning, some of those stars will face questions about making good on their promise. 
Here is a list of some of the celebs who claimed they would move out of the U.S. under a Trump administration. Liberal Actors 
Bryan Cranston said he hopes he doesn’t have to pack his bags, but would “definitely move” if Trump won. “Absolutely, I would definitely move,” the “Breaking Bad” star said on “The Bestseller Experiment” podcast. “It’s not real to me that that would happen. I hope to God it won’t.” Trump’s dominating victory in under 2 minutes and Hillary supporters crying: 
Samuel L. Jackson slammed Trump for running a “hate”-filled campaign and said he would move to South Africa if he wins. “If that mother becomes president, I’m moving my black ass to South Africa,” the movie star quipped to Jimmy Kimmel. 
Rape hoaxer Lena Dunham told Andy Cohen at the Matrix Awards that “I know a lot of people have been threatening to do this, but I really will. I know a lovely place in Vancouver.” The star and creator of HBO’s “Girls” has been a vocal advocate for Hillary Clinton , the Democratic nominee. 
Neve Campbell, an actress on the political drama “House of Cards,” vowed to move back home to Canada, while “Orange is the New Black” actress Natasha Lyonne said she would hightail it to a mental hospital. Liberal Singers 
Cher tweeted this summer that if Trump gets elected, “I’m moving to Jupiter.” 
Miley Cyrus wrote in an emotional Instagram post in March that tears were running down her cheek and she was unbelievably scared and sad. “I am moving if he is president,” the young pop star said. “I don’t say things I don’t mean!” 
Barbara Streisand, a vocal Clinton supporter, told “60 Minutes” that “I’m either coming to your country if you’ll let me in, or Canada.” 
Ne-Yo told TMZ last month that he’d move to Canada and be neighbors with fellow R&B singer Drake if the country elected Donald Trump. Liberal Comedians 
Comedian Amy Schumer said in September that Spain would be her destination of choice. 
“My act will change because I will need to learn to speak Spanish,” Schumer said in an appearance on the BBC’s “Newsnight.” “Because I will move to Spain or somewhere. It’s beyond my comprehension if Donald Trump won. It’s just too crazy.” 
Chelsea Handler said she already made contingency plans months ago. 
“I did buy a house in another country just in case,” the comedian and talk show host said during an appearance on “Live with Kelly and Michael” in May. “So all these people that threaten to leave the country and then don’t — I actually will leave that country.” Former “Daily Show” host Jon Stewart said he would consider “getting in a rocket and going to another planet, because clearly this planet’s gone bonkers” if the real estate mogul wins. 
Whoopi Goldberg, co-host of the “The View”, said on an episode of the talk show earlier this year that if the country elects Trump, “maybe it’s time for me to move, you know. I can afford to go.” Keegan-Michael Key said he would flee north to Canada. “It’s like, 10 minutes from Detroit,” the comedian told TMZ in January. “That’s where I’m from; my mom lives there. It’d make her happy too.” 
Hispanic comedian George Lopez said Trump “won’t have to worry about immigration” if he takes the White House because “we’ll all go back.” Liberal Political Figures 
Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg joked in an interview with The New York Times in July that it’d be time to move to New Zealand if Trump were to win. 
“Now it’s time for us to move to New Zealand,” she said quoting her husband who died in 2010. “I can’t imagine what the country would be with Donald Trump as our president. For the country, it could be four years. For the court, it could be — I don’t even want to contemplate that.” 
Ginsburg later apologized for her comments, calling them “ill-advised.” 
Civil rights activist Al Sharpton told a reporter earlier this year that he’s “reserving my ticket out of here if Donald Trump wins.” source

"Netanyahu Calls Trump ‘True Friend Of Israel’, Likud Party Pols Call For U.S. Embassy Move To Jerusalem","  Netanyahu Calls Trump ‘True Friend Of Israel’, Likud Party Pols Call For U.S. Embassy Move To Jerusalem Politicians from Netanyahu's Likud party called for Trump to follow through on his promise to move the US embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem, in a break with the policies of previous Republican and Democrat administrations   9, 2016 Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu congratulated Donald Trump on his election as US president on Wednesday and called him ‘a true friend of the state of Israel’. “For if thou altogether holdest thy peace at this time, then shall there enlargement and deliverance arise to the Jews from another place; but thou and thy father’s house shall be destroyed: and who knoweth whether thou art come to the kingdom for such a time as this?” Esther 4:14 (KJV) EDITOR’S NOTE: So where is the Bible in all this excitement surrounding this election? It’s right here – Jerusalem. God showed me well over a year ago that Donald Trump was “His man” for the White House for one reason, and one reason only. Because Donald Trump will move the US Embassy to Israel , an act which will declare Jerusalem as the capital of Israel, that will usher in an amazing time of fulfillment of prophecy on a scale that we have never seen. ‘I look forward to working with him to advance security, stability and peace in our region,’ Israeli leader Netanyahu said in a statement. He went on: ‘The ironclad bond between the United States and Israel is rooted in shared values, buttressed by shared interests and driven by a shared destiny. PM Netanyahu Congratulates US President-Elect Donald Trump: ‘I am confident that president-elect Trump and I will continue to strengthen the unique alliance between our two countries and bring it to ever greater heights.’ Netanyahu avoided controversial topics in his statement, unlike members of his government. Education Minister Naftali Bennett , who heads the hardline Jewish Home party , said Trump’s victory eradicated the idea of a Palestinian state. He said the unprecedented win was an ‘opportunity for Israel to immediately retract the notion of a Palestinian state in the centre of the country, which would hurt our security and just cause’. For such a time as this: The day I heard Donald Trump say that he will “move the US Embassy to Jerusalem as president”, the Lord tapped me on the shoulder and said “pay attention to that guy”. Glad I did. Listen to this 2-hour radio program on how Bible propehcy will likely be fulfilled. Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas said that he hopes ‘peace will be achieved’ during Trump’s term. Politicians from Netanyahu’s Likud party called for Trump to follow through on his promise to move the US embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem, in a break with the policies of previous Republican and Democrat administrations.

RESET: Vladimir Putin Says That Russia Is Ready To Do It’s Part To Rebuild Ties With America Under Trump,"  RESET: Vladimir Putin Says That Russia Is Ready To Do It’s Part To Rebuild Ties With America Under Trump Vladimir Putin earlier became one of the first world leaders to congratulate Trump via a telegram for his surprise triumph over Hillary Clinton.   Russian President Vladimir Putin on Wednesday said Moscow is ready to contribute to rebuilding relations with the United States with Donald Trump as president. EDITOR’S NOTE: Since Hillary Clinton’s and Barack Obama’s failed “Russian Reset” back in 2009, international relations between Russia and the United States have been a chilly 5 or 6 degrees above freezing. For the past year and a half, Russia and America have not talked at all, with Russia assuming power in the Middle East in Syria. Just hours after Donald Trump’s historic Electoral College landslide, Vladimir Putin has extended the olive branch of friendship and it could not have come at a better time. “We have heard the pre-election statements by then-candidate Trump, which were directed at rebuilding relations between Russia and the US,” Putin said during a speech before several ambassadors in the Kremlin. “We understand that this will not be an easy path considering the unfortunate degradation of relations,” he said. “But Russia is ready and wants to restore full-fledged relations with the US.”“We are ready to do our part and do everything to return (US-Russian) relations to the trajectory of development,” he said. “This would be in the interest of Russian and American people and would positively affect the general climate in international relations, considering the special responsibility of Russia and the US for ensuring global stability and security.” Remember this unqualified disaster? 
Secretary of State Hillary Clinton spearheaded the disastrous “Russian Reset” back in March of 2009 which only served to further damage relations with Russia. They couldn’t even spell the words on the thing properly. With reporters looking on, Clinton met Lavrov and handed him a gift – a green box tied in green ribbon. He unwrapped it to reveal a “ reset button ” a lighthearted reminder of Vice President Joe Biden’s recent remark that the administration of US President Barack Obama is hitting the reset button with Russia after years of friction during the Bush administration. The trouble was , the Russian-language label the Americans put on top of the button had the wrong word. Before she realised the mistake, Clinton assured Lavrov her staff had “worked hard” to get it right. Was it right? she inquired with a smile. “You got it wrong,” Lavrov responded, also smiling. He said the word the Americans chose –“peregruzka”– meant “overloaded” or “overcharged” rather than “reset”. Clinton quickly retorted with: “well, we won’t let you do that to us, I promise”. It was an embarrassment for the United States, to say the very least. Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov wants people to stop asking him about the failed “reset” with Russia because he says “it was the invention of Hillary Clinton and Obama administration.” Putin earlier became one of the first world leaders to congratulate Trump via a telegram for his surprise triumph over Hillary Clinton. Putin has tacitly supported Trump during the campaign, while Trump repeatedly flattered and praised the Russian leader and said he was willing to work with him. Russia’s parliament on Wednesday broke into applause upon learning of Trump’s win, and Russian markets climbed up, against the global slump on the news. source SHARE THIS ARTICLE  ",1

You are fakes, frauds, phonies and criminals. Now that you're out, stay out and don't come back. by Geoffrey Grider November 10, 2016 Donald Trump single-handedly took down the entire corrupt wing of the Republican Party 
Donald Trump’s run for the presidency over the past year and a half revealed some amazing things, it flushed out the rats that had hijacked the Republican Party like the Bush Crime Family and others.

(If you’d like a cheat sheet of the rest of the Republirats who jumped ship, click here .) 
Why did many of the pretend Republicans not vote for Donald Trump? Because they are part of the New World Order elite globalists, and they could not possibly support Trump’s America First agenda. The Bush Crime Family, after 28 years of corrupting the GOP, was finally exposed to the sunlight and what an ugly sight it was.

The November 1989 edition of SPY magazine featured photos of Bohemian Grove men dancing around dressed up as women . The article included artist renditions of the Moloch idol and discussed how they bus in male prostitutes and how AIDS is a big problem. In July of 2004, a New York Post article reported how a top gay-porn star, Chad Savage, serviced the moguls at the Bohemian Grove. Bigwigs who have attended the two-week retreat include George H.W. Bush , Dick Cheney, Alan Greenspan, Walter Cronkite, Alexander Haig, Jack Kemp, Henry Kissinger , Colin Powell , John Major, William F. Buckley, Justin Dart, William Randolph Hearst, Jr., Caspar Weinberger, Charles Percy, George Schultz, Edward Teller, and former C.I.A. director William Casey. A Brief History Of Molech, the Owl, the Bushes and the Bohemian Grove: 
The corrupt liberal media all said in lockstep that Donald Trump will “ destroy the Republican party “, but it was only a half-true statement. All the people who defected when Trump was nominated were people who needed to be expunged from the Grand Old Party of Lincoln and Reagan. 
To the Bush Crime Family , Colin Powell , William Kristol , and all the other phony Republicans who were exposed, you will not be welcome in the new America under President Donald Trump. You are fakes, frauds, phonies and criminals.

"500,000 People Sign Petition Asking Electoral College to Pick Clinton as President Instead of Trump","  500,000 People Sign Petition Asking Electoral College to Pick Clinton as President Instead of Trump The petition, launched on Wednesday after Donald Trump was elected President, calls for the Electoral College to “ignore their states’ votes and cast their ballots for Secretary Clinton.” Although Trump won over the 270 necessary electoral votes to secure the Presidency, Clinton narrowly earned the nation’s popular vote.   11, 2016 A petition on Change.org calling for the Electoral College to elect Hillary Clinton as President has earned over half of the signatures needed for it to be sent to the governing body. EDITOR’S NOTE: As stupid as this seems on the surface, at this point, I am not taking anything for granted. Donald Trump voters across America need to be made aware of this, and even now be working against it. Remember that with the Clintons, it’s never over. Ever. And as Christopher Stevens and Vince Foster will tell you, these people will stop at nothing. And please be forewarned, while this petition strategy is far-fetched, it is not impossible. The petition , launched on Wednesday after Donald Trump was elected President, calls for the Electoral College to “ignore their states’ votes and cast their ballots for Secretary Clinton.” Although Trump won over the 270 necessary electoral votes to secure the Presidency, Clinton narrowly earned the nation’s popular vote . The Electoral College – which was first introduced in 1804 – is comprised of 538 electors. Each state’s number of electors is decided by its number of members in Congress, which is dependent on the state’s population. So, when American citizens cast their ballots, they aren’t directly voting for president – they’re voting for electors. This year, Trump took 279, to Clinton’s 228. Petition circulates for Clinton presidency: Most states use a “winner-take-all” system when it comes to electoral votes, although there is no Constitutional provision or federal law that requires electors to vote a certain way. Twenty-six states and Washington, D.C., do, however, “bind” their electors to vote for the promised candidate on Dec. 19 – in this case, Trump. In many cases, “faithless electors” are forced to pay a fine if they vote against the popular choice. Understanding what a “Faithless Elector” is: 
In order for Hillary’s supporters to be successful, they will need to sway a significant number of the Electoral College to become “faithless electors”. This video will make it clear what exactly that is and how the process works. Maine and Nebraska follow a different method , called the congressional district method, which allots two electoral votes to the popular vote winner, and additional votes for each congressional district won by the candidates. Crying Hillary Voters Compilation: Faithless electors have not ever reversed the presidency. The Change.org petition, which was at over 500,000 signatures on Thursday afternoon, said that Clinton supporters would be happy to pay any fees accrued by those who choose to be faithless electors. “Mr. Trump is unfit to serve,” the petition claimed. “His scapegoating of so many Americans, and his impulsivity, bullying, lying, admitted history of sexual assault, and utter lack of experience make him a danger to the Republic. Secretary Clinton WON THE POPULAR VOTE and should be President.” source  ",1

His handpicked puppet Crooked Hillary was roundly rejected by the American people. So naturally, if you’re George Soros, the only thing left to do is pay unemployed liberals and leftists to march in the streets, spouting filthy curses while burning the American flag.

Both chambers of Congress remain in Republican hands. We are entering an era of profound and unprecedented challenge, a time of danger for our communities and our country. In this moment, we have to take care of ourselves, our families, and our friends—especially those of us who are on the front lines facing hate, including Latinos, women, immigrants, refugees, Black people, Muslims, LGBT Americans, and so many others. And we need to make it clear that we will continue to stand together.” source  ",1
CLINTON CASH 3.0: Chelsea Clinton Being Groomed To Buy Seat In Congress By NWO Handlers,"  CLINTON CASH 3.0: Chelsea Clinton Being Groomed To Buy Seat In Congress By NWO Handlers While Chelsea Clinton currently lives, and is registered to vote, in Manhattan, she could easily make Chappaqua her legal residence in order to run for Lowey’s seat when it becomes vacant.   11, 2016 While some pundits are declaring the Clinton political dynasty dead, sources tell us that it is far from over. Chelsea Clinton is being groomed for the New York seat held by Rep. Nita Lowey. 
Chelsea Clinton could run for the seat in NYC’s 17th Congressional District once Lowey, a respected, 79-year-old career politician with nearly 30 years in office, decides to retire, we have exclusively learned. 
Lowey’s district includes parts of Rockland and Westchester counties and, conveniently, Chappaqua, the Clinton family home base. Continuing the Clinton Crime Brand: 
If you thought for one, fleeting second that the Clintons would just somehow walk away after Crooked Hillary’s rejection by the American people, think again. There are many more billions to be made, and many more state favors to sell and trade. So the baton gets passed to Chelsea. Congresswoman Chelsea Clinton. Thanks for the Congressional seat, mom and dad! 
In August, Hillary and Bill Clinton purchased a home next door to their primary residence in Chappaqua for $1.16 million, which is intended for Chelsea, her husband, Marc Mezvinsky, and their two children, Charlotte and Aidan. While Chelsea currently lives, and is registered to vote, in Manhattan, she could easily make Chappaqua her legal residence in order to run for Lowey’s seat when it becomes vacant. 
A source told us , “While it is true the Clintons need some time to regroup after Hillary’s crushing loss , they will not give up. Chelsea would be the next extension of the Clinton brand. In the past few years, she has taken a very visible role in the Clinton Foundation and on the campaign trail. While politics isn’t the life Hillary wanted for Chelsea, she chose to go on the campaign trail for her mother and has turned out to be very poised, articulate and comfortable with the visibility.” 
The source continued, “There has been a lot of speculation within New York Democratic circles about Lowey’s retirement and Chelsea running for the seat. There is a belief that Chappaqua is a logical place for Chelsea to run, because it would be straightforward for her to raise money and build a powerful base.” 
A spokesperson for Lowey — who is serving her 14th term in Congress and was first elected to the House of Representatives in 1988 — declined to comment. A spokesperson for Chelsea didn’t get back to us. source SHARE THIS ARTICLE  ",1

They have realized they can no longer continue to lie to to the American people, and that the crap they peddle will no longer be accepted.

Sulzbergers letter was released after the paper’s public editor , Liz Spayd, took the paper to task for its election coverage. She pointed out how its polling feature Upshot gave Hillary Clinton an 84 percent chance as voters went to the polls. She compared stories that the paper ran about President-elect Donald Trump and Clinton, where the paper made Clinton look functional and organized and the Trump discombobulated. 
Spayd wrote, “Readers are sending letters of complaint at a rapid rate. Here’s one that summed up the feelings succinctly, from Kathleen Casey of Houston: “Now, that the world has been upended and you are all, to a person, in a state of surprise and shock, you may want to consider whether you should change your focus from telling the reader what and how to think, and instead devote yourselves to finding out what the reader (and non-readers) actually think.” The NYT would do well to plant some roots in Red America https://t.co/HDd4SFJqtq 
— Liz Spayd (@spaydl) November 9, 2016 She wrote about another reader who asked that the paper should focus on the electorate instead of “pushing the limited agenda of your editors.” 
“Please come down from your New York City skyscraper and join the rest of us.” 
Sulzberger—who insisted that the paper covered both candidates fairly– also sent a note to staffers on Friday reminding the newsroom to “give the news impartially, without fear or favor.” 
“But we also approach the incoming Trump administration without bias,” he said. source

Now, in the interest of full disclosure , when the Kenyan-born and Muslim-raised Barack Hussein Obama was elected, I declared he would “never be my president”. And for the entire time of his presidency I wrote over 1,300 articles exposing him and his Marxist plan for America. Let this website be my witness to that. This is how I exercised my Constitutional right to free speech. But at no time did I ever protest in the streets, ever threaten another human being, and I never used the global platform of NTEB to ever call for physical violence of any kind ever. 
Why not? 
Because though I despised the anti-American president Obama, I still loved America and the ideals she stood for. I saw myself as a patriot in exile, but still teared up every time I heard the National Anthem or read about a soldier’s heroic sacrifice on a foreign battlefield. These anti-Trump protesters that are clogging city streets at this very moment hate America, hate what this nation stands for, and seek to destroy it and us. They preach “love” while they shoot innocent people in the streets, they demand “tolerance” while offering none. They accuse Trump of having a “dark vision” for America while carrying out despotic deeds of darkness no Trump supporter would ever even dream of. Whitney Houston – Star Spangled Banner 
The United States Constitution allows you to burn the flag if that is how you choose to express yourself, and I accept that. But if that is how you choose to express yourself, you reveal your true nature and spirit. You who are now rioting in the street by permission of the very country you hold in contempt are depraved in both mind and spirit. You are not “protesting Donald Trump”, you are seeking to hurt, to maim and to destroy. That’s satanic. You are nothing more than a herpes blister on the beautiful mouth of Lady Liberty .

Palestinian UN Envoy Threatens Donald Trump If He Keeps Promise To Move Embassy To Jerusalem,"  Palestinian UN Envoy Threatens Donald Trump If He Keeps Promise To Move Embassy To Jerusalem The Palestinian ambassador to the UN on Friday warned President-elect Donald Trump that if he dares to move the U.S. embassy to Jerusalem, the Palestinians would “make life miserable” for the United States at the United Nations.   14, 2016 The Palestinian ambassador to the UN on Friday warned President-elect Donald Trump that if he dares to move the U.S. embassy to Jerusalem, the Palestinians would “make life miserable” for the United States at the United Nations. 
“Behold, I will make Jerusalem a cup of trembling unto all the people round about, when they shall be in the siege both against Judah and against Jerusalem.” Zechariah 12:2 (KJV) 
EDITOR’S NOTE: Donald Trump’s campaign promise to move the US Embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem is t he whole reason why I supported him in the first place. From a Bible prophecy perspective the implications and ramifications of such a move are off the charts. We warned from the very start that this move could easily trigger the Psalm 83 War. And right on cue, here comes the Palestinians protesting it already. Things are about to get very, very interesting…to say the least. 
“If people attack us by moving the embassy to Jerusalem, which is a violation of Security Council resolutions, it is a violation of Resolution 181 of the UN general assembly that was drafted by the U.S. … it means they are showing belligerency towards us. … If they do that nobody should blame us for unleashing all of the weapons that we have in the UN to defend ourselves and we have a lot of weapons in the UN,” Riyad Mansour said . 
Mansour conceded that such a move could not be passed as a Security Council resolution because of the U.S. veto. Nevertheless, he warned Trump, “Maybe I can’t have resolutions in the Security Council but I can make their lives miserable everyday with precipitating a veto on my admission as a member state.” 
Mansour warned that he would “reopen the whole Pandora’s Box” of verdicts in the International Criminal Court of Justice on the issue of Israel’s security fence and the settlements. 
He added that “it is illegal to defy Security Council resolutions that the U.S. is party to that the unilateral action by Israel annexing East Jerusalem is illegal and it is null and void. If the U.S. administration wants to defy international law they are doing something illegal.”  ",1

They shouted “ when they go low, we go high ” from the mountain tops 24 hours per day. Now that they’ve lost the election, their rallying cry has shifted to calls for rape and assassination of the First Lady and President-Elect Trumps.

After Trump won the presidential election on Tuesday, threats against his life spread on social media, as the Daily Mail reported : 
“So who’s going to assassinate Trump at his inauguration?” one Twitter user demanded to know. 
“I just pray that the first n***a who tries to assassinate Donald Trump don’t miss,” another added. 
One joked: “My mom is talking about assassinate donald trump. watch out guy my white suburban mother is coming for you.” 
While some also called for the death of vice president-elect Mike Pence. 
“If trump wins pls dont assassinate him without getting mike pence first because his a** is ****ing crazy,” one user tweeted… 
A source close to the Secret Service, told the DailyMail.com that the agency were well aware of the threats and that they had seen a spike since Trump was elected on Tuesday. 
They said there were ‘mechanisms in place’ to monitor social media for such posts, and to determine which threats were more concerning than others but said that “every threat was taken seriously.” 
Twitter routinely removed pro-Trump trending topics and manipulated hashtags that hurt failed Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton during the election. Furious users accused the site of censoring the explosive DNC Wikileaks story in July after #DNCLeaks, with over a quarter million tweets, vanished from the Trending section, replaced by the far less popular #DNCLeak. source SHARE THIS ARTICLE Geoffrey Grider NTEB is run by end times author and editor-in-chief Geoffrey Grider.

Video reveals that the “spontaneous” anti-Trump protesters are actually paid agitators bused in courtesy of the George Soros machine 
EDITOR’S NOTE: Video taken on the ground in Chicago yesterday show block after block of buses that are being used to bring in professional agitators to protest Donald Trump’s landslide victory over Hillary Clinton. Who is paying for all these buses bringing in all these protesters? Why, it’s our old friend George Soros, of course. And he is playing his favorite card, the race card. Soros, you will recall, spent millions busing in agitators to fuel the race riots in Ferguson , Baltimore and Chicago . 
From Zero Hedge: Earlier today we showed that, contrary to USA Today’s claims that the anti-Trump protests across the nation are “spontaneous, involving people from all walks of life”, according to Wikileaks documents at least two of the people profiled by USA Today have a history of being professional agitators for the Democratic party, whose task is to stir up popular protests and – in extreme cases – unleash rioting, such as the following clip showing the latest day of violent protests in Portland revealed.

Barack Obama Tells Alexis Tsipras That Rising Tide Of Nationalism Will Be A Threat To Globalism,"  Barack Obama Tells Alexis Tsipras That Rising Tide Of Nationalism Will Be A Threat To Globalism Speaking at a joint news conference with Greek Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras by his side, Obama refrained from criticizing President-elect Donald Trump directly as he discussed the impact of his electoral victory last week.   Obama warned Tuesday that Americans and people around the world “are going to have to guard against a rise in a crude sort of nationalism, or ethnic identity, or tribalism” taking root amid the populist movements that are gaining currency around the world. 
EDITOR’S NOTE: Why did the British people vote for Brexit ? Why did Donald Trump win in a landslide ? Because free peoples from any nation, once woken, will rightly reject globalism as a threat to individual freedom. NWO elites like Obama hate displays of nationalism like Trump’s America First campaign because he doesn’t believe America should come first. The coming Trump presidency is America’s first ray of sunlight in over 8 years. 
Speaking at a joint news conference with Greek Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras by his side, Obama refrained from criticizing President-elect Donald Trump directly as he discussed the impact of his electoral victory last week. But the president made it clear that he sees a dark side to the kind of populist movements Trump’s campaign embodied — ideals that other conservative leaders are advocating in Europe and elsewhere. WHO IS ALEXIS TSIPRAS? – click here to visit the NTEB Archive 
“We are going to have to guard against a rise in a crude sort of nationalism, or ethnic identity or tribalism that is built around an us and a them, and I will never apologize for saying that the future of humanity and the future of the world is going to be defined by what we have in common, as opposed to those things that separate us and ultimately lead us into conflict,” Obama said. 
“Take Europe,” he continued. “We know what happens when Europeans start dividing themselves up and emphasizing their differences and seeing a competition between various countries in a zero-sum way. The 20th century was a bloodbath.” Obama Full Press Conference with Alexis Tsipras in Greece: 
If you don’t wish to suffer through all the blather, fast-forward to 32:20 mark to hear his specific anti-America First mumbo-jumbo. 
Obama, who made it clear during the course of the hour-long news conference that he did not view the recent U.S. election results as a referendum on his own tenure or world vision, suggested that targeting specific racial, religious ethnic groups could backfire. 
“In the United States we know what happens when we start dividing ourselves along the lines of race or religion or ethnicity. It is dangerous. It is dangerous, not just for the minority groups that are subjected to that kind of discrimination, or in some cases in the past, violence, but because we then don’t realize our potential as a country when we are preventing blacks or Latinos or Asians or gays or women from fully participating in the project of building American life,” he said. 
“So my vision is right on that issue, and it may not always win the day in the short term in any particularly political circumstance, but I am confident it will win the day in the long term,” Obama added. “Because societies which are able to unify ourselves around values and ideals and character, and how we treat each other, and cooperation and innovation, ultimately are going to be more successful than societies that don’t.” 
Obama acknowledged that there was a common theme in the recent U.S. presidential election, Britain’s vote in June to leave the European Union, and other populist movements elsewhere. 
“Globalization, combined with technology, combined with social media and constant information, have disrupted people’s lives, sometimes in very concrete ways,” he said. “But also psychologically, people are less certain of their national identities or their place in the world. It starts looking different and disorienting.”  ",1
"A Defeated Obama Condescendingly Mocks Winner Trump, Says ‘He Can’t Keep Campaign Promises’","  A Defeated Obama Condescendingly Mocks Winner Trump, Says ‘He Can’t Keep Campaign Promises’ Obama scolded his Republican successor for believing he can deliver on his campaign promises. 'I think that he successfully mobilized a big chunk of the country to vote for him,' Obama told reporters.   Barack Obama delivered a series of patronizing backhanded compliments to President-Elect Donald Trump on Monday during a lengthy White House press conference conducted before his final trip abroad as America’s leader. While he praised Trump for pulling off ‘one of the biggest political upsets in history,’ Obama scolded his Republican successor for believing he can deliver on his campaign promises . ‘I think that he successfully mobilized a big chunk of the country to vote for him,’ Obama told reporters. But ‘regardless of what experience or assumptions he brought to the office, this office has a way of waking you up.’‘And those aspects of his positions or predispositions that don’t match up with reality, he will find shaken up pretty quick. Because reality has a way of asserting itself.’ Trump campaigned on an no-holds-barred agenda of dismantling much of Obama’s agenda including immigration reforms put in place without congressional input, a widely criticized Iranian nuclear deal and an Obamacare system whose pilings have grown shaky. But the president suggested the billionaire’s poetic rallies can never jive with Washington’s messier prose. ‘I think it’ll be important for him to have the room, to staff up, to figure out what his priorities are, to be able to distinguish between what he was campaigning on and what is practical – what he can actually achieve,’ Obama cautioned. ‘You know, there are certain things that made for good good soundbites, but don’t always translate into good policy. And that’s something that he and his team will wrestle with in the same way every president wrestles with.’ Ultimately, Obama hinted , he believes Trump is more a realist than a principled conservative – despite connecting with a previously disengaged voting base on the strength of broad promises.

President-Elect Trump Invites An Excited Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu To Come Visit,"  President-Elect Trump Invites An Excited Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu To Come Visit “The bond between the U.S. and Israel is based on shared values, shared interests and a shared future. I am sure that President-elect Trump and I will continue to strengthen the unique alliance between Israel and the U.S. and we will bring them to ever greater heights,” he added.   16, 2016 Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said he is looking forward to working with President-elect Donald Trump on “the twin interests of peace and security.” 
“For when they shall say, Peace and safety; then sudden destruction cometh upon them, as travail upon a woman with child; and they shall not escape.” 1 Thessalonians 5:3 (KJV) 
EDITOR’S NOTE: After enduring 8 years of a pro-Muslim, anti-Israel president , you can well imagine Benjamin Netanyahu’s excitement at a Donald Trump presidency. At the same time, it will be Trump’s very support that God will use to usher in some dramatic fulfillment of end times events. As we have been telling you – warning you – for over a year now, when Trump moves the US Embassy from Tel Aviv to Israel, get ready to fly. We here at NTEB believe that the move will trigger the Psalm 83 war, or worse, and that the Rapture of the Church will then be right around the corner. If you have something you want to get done for the Lord, do it now. 
In a satellite address to the Jewish Federations of North America ’s annual General Assembly in Washington on Tuesday, Netanyahu urged President Barack Obama to continue America’s “longstanding policy” of supporting direct negotiations between Israel and the Palestinians, and not pursue other avenues. Israel is concerned that Obama will use his final days in office to push for a UN Security Council resolution that will impose a two-state solution to the conflict. 
“I, for one, find great encouragement in the fact that there’s this continuity of friendship,” Netanyahu said . “I very much hope that President Obama will continue the policy that he enunciated,” Netanyahu said, referring to comments made by the outgoing president at the beginning of his first term. “The only way you get a workable and enduring peace is to have the parties agree to it. This is what has happened with our peace agreements with Egypt and Jordan. PM Netanyahu Congratulates US President-Elect Donald Trump: 
“We’ve had convulsions in the Middle East, and yet these peace treaties hold because they were directly agreed to by the parties,” he added. “The reason we’ll object to any such effort is because it will harden the Palestinian position, and because it will harden the Palestinian position, it will push peace back.” Netanyahu added that he is hoping to nurture the recent “quiet diplomacy” Israel has had with Arab nations with the future Trump administration. 
The day after the Republican candidate rocked the world by winning the election, he invited Netanyahu to visit Washington at the “first opportunity.” The prime minister and president-elect “who have known each other for many years, had a warm, heartfelt conversation” over the phone, a statement from the Prime Minister’s Office said . 
Netanyahu responded by saying that he and his wife Sara were excited to visit the incoming commander-in-chief and his wife Melania. Netanyahu congratulated Trump earlier in the day, calling the president-elect “a true friend of the State of Israel.” Donald Trump vows to protect Israel: “We will work together to advance security, stability and peace in our region,” Netanyahu said in a statement. 
“The bond between the U.S. and Israel is based on shared values, shared interests and a shared future. I am sure that President-elect Trump and I will continue to strengthen the unique alliance between Israel and the U.S. and we will bring them to ever greater heights,” he added. 
The son of the late president Shimon Peres, Chemi Peres, also congratulated Trump in his speech to the Jewish Federations General Assembly. 
“I would like to wish President-elect Trump the best of luck,” he said. “I am sure he will maintain the unbreakable link between Israel and the U.S., at the core of which are the unwavering support of Israel’s security and the forever-extended hand for peace.” source SHARE THIS ARTICLE  ",1
Proof Of George Soros Nazi Past Finally Comes To Light With Discovery Of Forgotten Interview,"  Proof Of George Soros Nazi Past Finally Comes To Light With Discovery Of Forgotten Interview George Soros has repeatedly called 1944 ""The Best Year of his Life."" 70% of Mr. Soros's fellow Jews in Hungary, nearly a half-million human beings, were annihilated in that year, yet he gives no sign that this put any damper on his elation, either at the time or indeed in retrospect.   15, 2016 When Hitler’s henchman Adolf Eichmann arrived in Hungary, to oversee the murder of that country’s Jews, George Soros ended up with a man whose job was confiscating property from the Jewish population. 
George Soros and other rich liberals who spent tens of millions of dollars trying to elect Hillary Clinton are gathering in Washington for a three-day, closed door meeting to retool the big-money left to fight back against Donald Trump. Since Soros name is very much in the headlines in 2016, let’s take a look at an interview he gave in 1998 about his Nazi past. Nazi collaborator Soros gave MILLIONS to Hillary Clinton’s failed campaign 
Social unrest groups like Media Matters have taken to the Internet in an attempt to “debunk the claims” and “correct the smears” about rumors of the Nazi past of their patron, George Soros. They say it is just malicious gossip and lies people make up about Soros because they don’t like him. Snopes.com chimes in as well in defense of Soros. But what about the “rumors”? Could they be true, are they true? 
As you will see and hear , not only are the rumors true, a long forgotten interview George Soros did on 60 Minutes has him gleefully confessing to his crime. 
György Schwartz, better known to the world as George Soros , was born August 12, 1930 in Hungary. Soros’ father, Tivadar, was a fervent practitioner of the Esperanto language invented in 1887, and designed to be the first global language, free of any national identity. The Schwartz’s, who were non-practicing Jews, changed the family name to Soros, in order to facilitate assimilation into the Gentile population, as the Nazis spread into Hungary during the 1930s 
When Hitler’s henchman Adolf Eichmann arrived in Hungary, to oversee the murder of that country’s Jews, George Soros ended up with a man whose job was confiscating property from the Jewish population. Soros went with him on his rounds. 
George Soros has repeatedly called 1944 “ The Best Year of his Life. ” 70% of Mr. Soros’s fellow Jews in Hungary, nearly a half-million human beings, were annihilated in that year, yet he gives no sign that this put any damper on his elation, either at the time or indeed in retrospect. During an interview with “Sixty Minute’s” Steve Kroft, Soros was asked about his “best year.” George Soros Interview Where He Admitted He Was A Nazi Collaborator: 
He was only to happy to admit his collaboration with the Nazis,in fact, he called those days the “best time of my life”. Click to watch, in context, that startling confession. 
KROFT: My understanding is that you went out with this protector of yours who swore that you were his adopted godson. 
SOROS: Yes. Yes. 
KROFT: Went out, in fact, and helped in the confiscation of property from your fellow Jews, friends and neighbors. 
SOROS: Yes. That’s right. Yes. 
KROFT: I mean, that sounds like an experience that would send lots of people to the psychiatric couch for many, many, years. Was it difficult? 
SOROS: No, not at all. Not at all, I rather enjoyed it. 
KROFT: No feelings of guilt? 
SOROS: No, only feelings of absolute power. SHARE THIS ARTICLE  ",1
Investors Flock To West Texas As $900 BILLION Oil Field Discovered In Permian Basin Wolfcamp,"NTEB Ads Privacy Policy Investors Flock To West Texas As $900 BILLION Oil Field Discovered In Permian Basin Wolfcamp Oil explorers have been flocking to the Permian Basin in West Texas and New Mexico to tap deposits so rich that they can generate profits even at lower oil prices. by Geoffrey Grider November 16, 2016 In a troubled oil world, the Permian Basin is the gift that keeps on giving. 
One portion of the giant field , known as the Wolfcamp formation, was found to hold 20 billion barrels of oil trapped in four layers of shale beneath West Texas. That’s almost three times larger than North Dakota’s Bakken Play and the single largest U.S. unconventional crude accumulation ever assessed, according to the U.S. Geological Survey . At current prices, that oil is worth almost $900 billion. 
The estimate lends credence to the assertion from Pioneer Natural Resources CEO Scott Sheffield that the Permian’s shale could hold as much as 75 billion barrels, making it second only to Saudi Arabia’s Ghawar field. Irving-based Pioneer has been increasing its production targets all year as drilling in the Wolfcamp produced bigger gushers than the company’s engineers and geologists forecast. “The fact that this is the largest assessment of continuous oil we have ever done just goes to show that, even in areas that have produced billions of barrels of oil, there is still the potential to find billions more,” Walter Guidroz, coordinator for the geological survey’s energy resources program, said in the statement. Oil explorers have been flocking to the Permian Basin in West Texas and New Mexico to tap deposits so rich that they can generate profits even at lower oil prices. A race to grab land in the Permian has been the main driver of a surge of deals in the energy patch and the industry’s main source of good news. Although the Permian has been gushing crude since the 1920s, its multiple layers of oil-soaked shale remained largely untapped until the last several years, when intensive drilling and fracturing techniques perfected in other U.S. regions were adopted. The Wolfcamp, which is as much as a mile thick in some places, has been one of the primary targets. ConocoPhillips , the world’s largest independent oil producer by market value, increased its estimate for the size of its Wolfcamp holdings on Nov. 10 to 1.8 billion barrels from 1 billion last year. A day earlier, Concho Resources CEO Timothy Leach told investors and analysts that two recent wells it drilled in the Wolfcamp were pumping an average of 2,000 barrels a day each. Diamondback Energy Inc. disclosed last week that it has been drilling 10,000-foot sideways wells in the Wolfcamp. Production from the wells has been as high as 85 percent crude, according to the Midland, Texas-based explorer. For Apache Corp., a slice of the Wolfcamp and another Permian layer known as the Bone Spring are major components of the 3 billion-barrel Alpine High discovery that the company announced in September. CEO John Christmann called Alpine High “a world class resource” during a Sept. 7 presentation at a Barclays Plc conference in New York. The Wolfcamp shale also holds 16 trillion cubic feet of natural gas and 1.6 billion barrels of gas liquids, the geological survey said in a statement on Tuesday. source SHARE THIS ARTICLE Geoffrey Grider NTEB is run by end times author and editor-in-chief Geoffrey Grider.

"Desperate To ‘Preserve His Legacy’, Barack Obama Releases 527 Pages Of New Regulations In ONE Day!","  Desperate To ‘Preserve His Legacy’, Barack Obama Releases 527 Pages Of New Regulations In ONE Day! According to the Competitive Enterprise Institute, the Obama administration has just shattered the old record for pages of regulations and rules published by the in-house journal, the Federal Register. At 81,640 total pages for 2016, it ranks first and 235 pages more than all of those published in 2010, the previous record.   17, 2016 President Obama has just set a new record for rules and regulations, his administration spitting out 527 pages worth in just one day, as he races to put his fingerprint on virtually every corner of American life and business. 
According to the Competitive Enterprise Institute, the administration has just shattered the old record for pages of regulations and rules published by the in-house journal, the Federal Register . At 81,640 total pages for 2016, it ranks first and 235 pages more than all of those published in 2010, the previous record. The rules, politics of federal regulations under Obama: 
As shocking as this video is , it was made 5 months ago and does not reflect the current race-to-regulate happening right now. What’s more, there are still about 26 working days left in the year. 
“No one knows what the future holds, but at a pace of well over 1,000 pages weekly, the Federal Register could easily top 90,000 pages this year. The simple algebra says that at the current pace we’ll add 11,190 pages over the next 44 days, to end 2016 at around 92,830 pages,” said CEI’s Clyde Wayne Crews. 
“This is astonishing and should be of great concern, and intolerable, to policymakers. It is remarkable enough that the all-time record has been passed before Thanksgiving,” he added. Obama has promised to regulate by executive authority, but the sheer number of pages of regulations being rushed through is astonishing. 
Still, it’s not a big surprise to CEI and other regulation watchdogs. 
The reason, said Crews, Obama owns seven of the 10 highest-ever Federal Register counts. 
He called on President-elect Trump to make good on campaign promises and cut regulations. 
“President-elect Donald Trump could take a page from President Reagan, who brought page counts down from Carter’s 73,258 to as low as 44,812. We don’t need a pen and phone, we need a meat axe,” said Crews. source

"If Hillary Is Not Guilty, Then Why Are Her Supporters Asking Obama To Pardon Her? Hmm…","  If Hillary Is Not Guilty, Then Why Are Her Supporters Asking Obama To Pardon Her? Hmm… ""Hillary Clinton has not been tried, but there are those who want to drag her for the next three years. It will not stop until they find a reason to put her in jail. That would be a travesty.""""It would be a monumental moral mistake to pursue the indictment of Hillary Clinton,"" Jackson said. He said issuing the pardon could help heal the nation, like Ford's pardon of Nixon did.   16, 2016 Speaking at President Gerald Ford’s alma mater, The Rev. Jesse Jackson called for President Obama to issue a blanket pardon to Hillary Clinton before he leaves office, just like Ford did for Richard Nixon. 
Stopping short of saying Clinton did anything wrong , Jackson told a large crowd of University of Michigan students, faculty and administrators gathered at daylong celebration of his career that Obama should short-circuit President-elect Donald Trump’s promised attempt to prosecute Hillary Clinton for use of a private e-mail server. 
“It would be a monumental moral mistake to pursue the indictment of Hillary Clinton,” Jackson said. He said issuing the pardon could help heal the nation, like Ford’s pardon of Nixon did. Would Obama pardon Clinton before he leaves office? 
“President Ford said we don’t need him for trophy. We need to move on. President Nixon wasn’t convicted of a crime. He didn’t apply for a pardon. (Ford) did it because he thought it would be best for the country. “Hillary Clinton has not been tried, but there are those who want to drag her for the next three years. It will not stop until they find a reason to put her in jail. That would be a travesty.” 
In 1974, Ford, a University of Michigan alumnus, issued a full and complete pardon of Nixon for any crimes he may have committed. He said the pardon was in the best interests of the nation. 
Jackson’s comments came at the end of a long day in Ann Arbor, which included him dropping in on an anti-Trump rally held by students on campus. Jesse Jackson: Obama should pardon Hillary Clinton 
Jackson comes to a campus that is full of strife over race. Numerous racist flyers have been posted and students have alleged they have been attacked because they are Muslim or a minority. There have been anti-Trump marches on U-M’s campus, along with campuses across the nation. A large demonstration marched through a series of U-M buildings even while Jackson was speaking. 
Students “are growing up in an America that is in an identity crisis,” Jackson said. “These demonstrations are born out of fear. Fear that the Klan will ride again. Fear that violence (against minorities) is coming back. 
“In this election, voters voted for fear. I think hope will defeat hate, but it’s a battle.” In a conversation with the Free Press at the beginning of the day, he blamed Trump for the environment of fear. 
Donald Trump saw an America that was a dry field, and instead of watering it to get the grass growing again, he threw a lit match on it, Jackson said. 
Now it’s up to Trump to take action, Jackson added. 
“The one who set the field afire must be the one to put it out,” he told the Free Press in a one-on-one interview. “He had the option to pour water on it (the dry field) and let it grow. He didn’t do that — he chose to light it on fire. One of my concerns is that we see the division in America now because of that. We see classmates, roommates in a conflict over the way the campaign turned out. 
“He knows Mexicans didn’t take jobs from us. It was the corporations. He knows you can’t deport 15 million (immigrants). It’s not just about the adults, but also about the children who were born here, grew up here and go to school here.” 
Jackson told students not to give up the struggle. 
“Students, don’t let them take your hope. Deep water doesn’t drown you. You drown because you stop kicking. There is a tug of war for the soul of America. Do we want to be an aristocracy or a democracy? To be silent is to betray your conscience. You must not be silent in the face of violation of human rights.” source SHARE THIS ARTICLE  ",1

The infamous main stream media are no where near the “main stream” when it comes to understanding what the vast majority of America wants and needs. Donald Trump’s landslide election night win was a referendum on the corrupt, liberal-biased opinion creators posing as journalists. Donald Trump Calls Out The Corrupt Bias Media – Mainstream Media Attacks: 
2016 will go down as the year that the American people woke from their slumber and began to throw off the shackles of globalism, elitism and the faux journalism of the Chicago Way .

And the automaker doesn’t dispute that. 
EDITOR’S NOTE: Donald Trump made a handful of super hardcore campaign promises which resulted in being the deciding factor why so many Americans voted for him. One of those promises was that he would seek to impose a 35% tariff on Ford Motors if they moved to Mexico. Mere days after Trump’s massive victory, Ford chairman Bill Ford personally called president-elect Trump to congratulate him on his win, and to say that Ford will not be moving. Say it with me one time –“ Make America Great Again! “ 
“Just got a call from my friend Bill Ford, Chairman of Ford, who advised me that he will be keeping the Lincoln plant in Kentucky — no Mexico,” Trump wrote in a Twitter post.

Ford builds the Lincoln MKC small SUV at its Louisville Assembly Plant in Kentucky alongside the Ford Escape SUV. Ford had never said it was considering shifting MKC production south of the border. But the company confirmed Friday that it had been “likely” to move the work to Mexico in 2019 when its current contract with the United Auto Workers union expires. TRUMP FLASHBACK: Ford moving division to Mexico is a disgrace: 
This is what started the ball rolling for Trump back in the beginnings of his campaign. “We had planned to move the Lincoln MKC out of Louisville Assembly Plant,” probably to the Cuautitlan factory in Mexico, Christin Baker, a Ford spokeswoman, said in an e-mail. 
Trump has criticized Ford for planning to move all its North American small-car production to Mexico, where wages are 80 percent lower than in the U.S. Ford also builds the Lincoln MKZ sedan at a factory in Hermosillo, Mexico. During the campaign, Trump threatened to slap Ford’s Mexican-built cars with a 35 percent tariff . He also said he would terminate the North American Free Trade Agreement, which lets goods flow between Mexico, the U.S. and Canada without tariffs. Ford Says It’s Keeping Lincoln Production in Kentucky After Donald Trump Tweets 
Ford, which has expressed a willingness to work with Trump since he was elected, confirmed late Thursday it told the future president the Lincoln SUV will stay in Kentucky. 
“We are encouraged that President-elect Trump and the new Congress will pursue policies that will improve U.S. competitiveness and make it possible to keep production of this vehicle here in the U.S.,” the automaker said in an e-mailed statement. 
Bill Ford met with Trump during the campaign in an unsuccessful attempt to get the candidate to stop targeting the automaker, which says it has created nearly 28,000 jobs in the U.S. during the past five years. In his first answer of the first debate with Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton, Trump attacked the automaker for plans to move production of the Focus small car and C-Max hybrid from a plant in Michigan to Mexico. 
“We are everything that he should be celebrating about this country,” Bill Ford told reporters in September. “We pulled ourselves up by our bootstraps, we paid back our borrowings, we are healthy again, we’ve been adding jobs in the U.S. and we are the largest manufacturer of cars and trucks in the U.S.” source SHARE THIS ARTICLE Geoffrey Grider NTEB is run by end times author and editor-in-chief Geoffrey Grider.

The aircraft – usually launched at the outbreak of a nuclear attack – was spotted circling by thousands of US citizens on the ground. The unbranded plane travelled across several states and changed directions numerous times, prompting a Twitter frenzy of conspiracy theories . 
These were only intensified after a spokeswoman for the Naval Air Forces confirmed the plane was in fact their own E-6B Mercury, also known as the Doomsday Plane. Mysterious U.S.A.F ‘Doomsday Plane’ Circling Over Denver Metro Area: 
Not only was the mysterious ‘Doomsday Plane’ circling over the Denver metro area for hours, it also seemed to be spraying chemtrails out the back as it circled. 
Local news outlet Denver7 tracked flight IRON99 as it traveled from the west coast to Oklahoma. The plane eventually landed at Tinker Air Force Base in Oklahoma city after an hour loitering above Denver. 
The news station’s initial attempts to find where the plane originated proved fruitless as officials from the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), U.S. Northern Command (NORTHCOM), U.S. Strategic Command (STRATCOM), North American Aerospace Defense Command (NORAD) and a dozen Air Force Bases could not confirm the flight. 
The next day, however, the Navy confirmed that the mysterious aircraft was in fact one of its E-6B Mercury planes, known as the ‘Doomsday plane’ , and was simply returning to its homebase. These planes, created by Boeing at a cost of $141.7 million per unit, have the capability to launch nuclear missiles and communicate with nuclear submarines. 
The overall mission of the E-6B is to provide “command, control and communications abilities between the National Command Authority (NCA) and U.S. strategic and non-strategic forces.” 
A nd if you think all that is creepy , which it is, just remember what it was circling over… The Secrets of the Denver International Airport 
The most amazing thing about the Denver International Airport (DIA) is not that it is filled to the brim with very freaky occultic symbols everywhere you look, it’s that it is everywhere you look. Instead of trying to hide them, or be clever about it, these works of darkness are on bold display, daring you to figure them out. And there is no question of any kind that all these symbols do indeed tell a story that is yet to be realized. The story of an evil, tragic holocaust. Do I have your attention? 
The satanic nature of the Masons is well-known , and we shall not go into that here in this article. (if you would like to learn about Freemasonry, click here for an excellent introduction.) But what I would like to call your attention to is what is written right under the Masons logo. It reads “New World Airport Commission.” Not only does it sound like a name created by conspiracy theorists, the other startling fact is that the ‘New World Airport Commission’ doesn’t seem to exist. Anywhere.

How often does one of your Facebook friends just “disappear”, and then 3 days, a week, 3 weeks later they pop back up and tell you that they were in “ Facebook Jail “? I see it happening a lot, and am sure that you do as well. Many people, when deprived of the ability to post and interact with their global community, get anxious, depressed and experience genuine psychological trauma. Over the last 10 years, we have been retrained to think differently, act differently, and experience life through the filter of the cyber-world.

Under the rule of Antichrist , in order to be included in the global community, you are required to take the Mark. If you refuse, swift, severe and fatal judgment will be issued and you will cease to exist. The Bible says that people refusing the Mark will be decapitated. There is no forgiveness from God for taking the Mark, but if you don’t take the Mark you can’t feed your babies, pay your bills, or interact with the global community. 
“And I saw thrones, and they sat upon them, and judgment was given unto them: and I saw the souls of them that were beheaded for the witness of Jesus, and for the word of God, and which had not worshipped the beast, neither his image, neither had received his mark upon their foreheads, or in their hands; and they lived and reigned with Christ a thousand years.” Revelation 20:4 (KJV) 
Social media is training you to accept global rules in order to maintain membership in a global community. More people now connect to the web via hand-held devices than through desktop or laptop computers. Those devices control more and more of our daily lives. There are apps to regulate the air conditioning and heating in your home, open your garage door , deposit money to to your bank account , monitor your vital signs , or meet a date for Saturday night . We literally could not function in our society without these things. So will it really be a big leap from having your device on your belt to having your device under your skin? Nope, not at all. People will jump at the chance to do it. 
“And with all deceivableness of unrighteousness in them that perish; because they received not the love of the truth, that they might be saved.

So the next time you try to login to one of your social media accounts, only to receive the dreaded warning of “Your account has been suspended for __ days for violation of our policies”, and you get first angry and then depressed, remember you’re part of the new global community.

How Donald Trump Moving The U.S. Embassy From Tel Aviv To Jerusalem Could Trigger The Psalm 83 War,"NTEB Ads Privacy Policy How Donald Trump Moving The U.S. Embassy From Tel Aviv To Jerusalem Could Trigger The Psalm 83 War God is concerned with His nation of Israel and with His chosen people, the Jews. In the third chapter of Joel, we read that God wages the Battle of Armageddon because people have divided up Israel, a place that He calls ""my land"". by Geoffrey Grider November 18, 2016 In the third chapter of Joel, we read that God wages the Battle of Armageddon because people have divided up Israel, a place that He calls “my land” 
“They have said, Come, and let us cut them off from being a nation; that the name of Israel may be no more in remembrance.” Psalm 83:4 (KJV) 
One of Donald Trump’s main campaign promises is that he would move the U.S. Embassy from its currents location in Tel Aviv, Israel, to the Old City Israeli capital of Jerusalem. See for yourself how the massive AIPAC audience erupted in frenzied cheers when he said it: 
Most people , unsaved people, honestly probably didn’t even bat an eye when he said as most people don’t really care about what happens in tiny, little Israel. But to the Bible believing Christian, those words rang out with a clarion call that something really big just appeared on the end times prophecy radar. Back on October 28, 2016, the headline over on jpost.com was “ Ivanka Trump Says Her Father Will Move US Embassy To Jerusalem ‘100%’ If Elected “. 
I truly hope that President Trump will make America great again, I really do. But if you think for one moment that that’s why God allowed him to be elected you are deceiving yourself. God is not concerned so much with America, He really isn’t. God is concerned with His nation of Israel and with His chosen people, the Jews. In the third chapter of Joel, we read that God wages the Battle of Armageddon because people have divided up Israel, a place that He calls “my land”. Read it for yourself: 
“I will also gather all nations, and will bring them down into the valley of Jehoshaphat, and will plead with them there for my people and for my heritage Israel, whom they have scattered among the nations, and parted my land.” Joel 3:2 (KJV) The reason why the Palestinian continue to reject the Two State Solution 
Multiple times a “two state solution” has been offered to the Palestinian people, and every time it is offered they reject it. Why? Because in the Two State Solution, Jerusalem stays with Israel as it rightly should and infuriates the Palestinians. When Lucifer fell in Isaiah 14, it was because he was no longer satisfied with the good things that God had given him, he wanted it all. Lucifer wanted to sit in God’s Seat and replace God: 
“For thou hast said in thine heart, I will ascend into heaven, I will exalt my throne above the stars of God: I will sit also upon the mount of the congregation, in the sides of the north: I will ascend above the heights of the clouds; I will be like the most High. Yet thou shalt be brought down to hell, to the sides of the pit.” Isaiah 14:13-15 (KJV) 
Now that you know that , can you see why there is coming such a fierce battle over Jerusalem? Because Jerusalem is God’s Holy Place, the Bible calls it the “city of the great King”. Why? Because it will be to Jerusalem that Jesus will return to as King of Kings and will rule with a “rod of iron” over the nations. That’s why. The coming battles that will take place there will be fought through humans, but it is actually a battle between God and the Devil. So now let’s take a look at Psalm 83, there is a war mentioned there connected with the time of Jacob’s trouble . 
“For they have consulted together with one consent: they are confederate against thee: The tabernacles of Edom, and the Ishmaelites; of Moab, and the Hagarenes; Gebal, and Ammon, and Amalek; the Philistines with the inhabitants of Tyre; Assur also is joined with them: they have holpen the children of Lot. Selah.” Psalm 83:5-8 (KJV) 
Look at all the nations that surround Israel to attack her , what do they all have in common? They are Muslim nations! Look at a Google map of Israel and you will see that in 2016 Israel is 100% surrounded by 100% Muslim nations. See the word Selah at the end of verse 8? That little clue tells us that the Psalm 83 War is connected with the time of Jacob’s trouble. (please read our article entitled “ THE REAL MEANING OF THE WORD SELAH IN THE BIBLE ” for further insight on this issue.) THE BIBLE BELIEVERS GUIDE TO UNDERSTANDING THE DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THE RAPTURE AND THE SECOND COMING 
When Donald Trump moves the Embassy to Jerusalem , thus declaring that the United States recognizes it as Israel’s capital, the entire Arab world will go crazy. We believe it is not only possible but probable that this will trigger, at some point, the Psalm 83 War. But if we are that close to that, we are even this much closer to this: The Rapture of the Church must come first 
What part of the time of Jacob’s trouble will the Church be involved in? None of it. Why? Because it is the time of (write this on the chalkboard 100 times) Jacob’s trouble. It has nothing to do with the church. Putting the Church of Jesus Christ into the time of Jacob’s trouble – Israel’s trouble – is nothing more than bad, old-fashioned replacement theology . If that offends you because you put the Church in Matthew 24 where it doesn’t belong, then guess what? Be offended. Because stealing any of Israel’s promises, including the negative ones, is replacement theology. 
If we are really this close to the time of Jacob’s trouble and the Psalm 83 War, then we are really, really close to the time of the Pretribulation Rapture of the Church . A sobering thought, isn’t it? Donald Trump’s miracle win was really just that – a miracle. But it was a miracle with a purpose , to accomplish God’s will and plan in these end times. We have been saying this to anyone who will listen for well over a year now. 
Have you ever stopped to consider the physical structure of the word ‘Jerusalem’? Take a closer look – Jer USA lem. Now what do you see? 
For the Bible believer and prophecy watcher , we are most certainly living in exciting times. Perhaps the most exciting since May 14, 1948 . 
Are YOU ready for what comes next? Mere minutes after posting this article, the UK Daily Mail published this: The two-time White House hopeful, former Fox New Channel weekend host and former governor of Arkansas will be America’s next ambassador to Israel, a presidential transition official confirmed to DailyMail.com on Friday. He is scheduled to meet with President-Elect Donald Trump Friday at 2:00 p.m. Huckabee, an ordained Baptist preacher and electric bass player, will become the tip of Trump’s spear as he seeks to shake up U.S. foreign relations in the Middle East, beginning with relocating America’s embassy in Israel from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem. ‘That’s going to happen,’ the transition official said. ‘Governor Huckabee is going to see it through.’ source SHARE THIS ARTICLE  ",1
More Differences Between The Pretribulation Rapture And The Second Coming Of Jesus Christ,"NTEB Ads Privacy Policy More Differences Between The Pretribulation Rapture And The Second Coming Of Jesus Christ There are so who ignorantly assert that the doctrine of the Pretribulation Rapture of the Church was ""unknown before John Nelson Darby taught it"". I say ""ignorant"" because people make comments like these seemingly unaware that there are recorded accounts of it being taught all the way back to the 4th century AD. by Geoffrey Grider November 21, 2016 The doctrine of the Pretribulation Rapture appears over and over again, in both Old and New Testaments. Take Enoch for example. 
“For the Lord himself shall descend from heaven with a shout, with the voice of the archangel, and with the trump of God: and the dead in Christ shall rise first: Then we which are alive and remain shall be caught up together with them in the clouds, to meet the Lord in the air: and so shall we ever be with the Lord.” 1 Thessalonians 4:16,17 (KJV) 
For a reason that eludes me , the Bible doctrine of the Pretribulation Rapture of the Church of Jesus Christ is a highly-despised subject in these Laodicean times we find ourselves in. Perhaps one of the reasons why it is so hated is because so many preachers stopped preaching on it years ago, because the idea of trying to live your life with a daily expectation of Jesus’ return is unpalatable to so many. Yet, the doctrine of the Pretribulation Rapture appears over and over again, in both Old and New Testaments. Take Enoch for example. 
“And all the days of Enoch were three hundred sixty and five years: And Enoch walked with God: and he was not; for God took him.” Genesis 5:23,24 (KJV) Enoch is a type of the gentile believer raptured out before the time of Jacob’s trouble 
Who was Enoch? Glad you asked, Enoch was a gentile believer and follower of God. The Bible says that Enoch’s walk with the Lord was a really good one, and one day out of the clear blue, God raptured old Enoch up and out of this world, and translated him straight to the throne room of Heaven. Just a few verses later we read about the Flood of Noah, a type of the Great Tribulation which came upon the Earth. Something else about Enoch, he was also a street preacher who preached Jesus to lost people. 
“And Enoch also, the seventh from Adam, prophesied of these, saying, Behold, the Lord cometh with ten thousands of his saints, To execute judgment upon all, and to convince all that are ungodly among them of all their ungodly deeds which they have ungodly committed, and of all their hard speeches which ungodly sinners have spoken against him.” Jude 1:14,15 (KJV) 
So, in type, we see the Pretribulation Rapture and the time of Jacob’s trouble happening thousands of years before the coming time when those events will take place in real time, and not just in typology. In the New Testament, the apostle John is taken up to Heaven in yet another type of the Rapture. On the Last Times, the Antichrist, and the End of the World 
There are so who ignorantly assert that the doctrine of the Pretribulation Rapture of the Church was “unknown before John Nelson Darby taught it”. I say “ignorant” because people make comments like these seemingly unaware that there are recorded accounts of it being taught all the way back to the 4th century AD. 
A sermon entitled “ On the Last Times, the Antichrist, and the End of the World “, ascribed to a man by the name of Ephraem Syrus, taught the doctrine of the Pretribulation Rapture quite plainly. Here is a snippet from that sermon: 
“For all the saints and elect of God are gathered, prior to the tribulation that is to come, and are taken to the Lord lest they see the confusion that is to overwhelm the world because of our sins” 
That sermon would be the last bit of light from scripture before the Roman Catholic Whore of Babylon would swallow up the Christian Church for over a thousand years. There’s a reason why that period of time used to be taught in schools as the “ dark ages “, and the time corresponding with the advent of King James Bible in 1611 as the “age of enlightenment”. 
So as you can see , God has given types, examples and preaching on the Rapture for thousands of years. Now let us take a quick look at some of the major difference between the Pretribulation Rapture of the Church, and the Second Coming of Jesus Christ. THE SPIRITUAL TEMPERATURE OF THE CHURCH: Jesus says plainly in Revelation 3 that the last version of the Christian Church right before the Rapture is a self-centered, self-focused, lukewarm mess of a Church that locks Jesus on the outside. (Revelation 3:14-22 KJV). This is in stark contrast to Revelation 7 which shows an on-fire dedicated group of believers who “follow the Lamb wherever He goes”. There will not be anything “lukewarm” in the time of Jacob’s trouble. SATAN STILL FREE TO ROAM AFTER THE RAPTURE: In the first three chapters of Revelation, we plainly see the Church Age. That comes to an end in Revelation 4:1,2 where John, a type of the Church, is taken to Heaven in a type of the Rapture. Match those verses with 1 Corinthians 15:50-57 and 1 Thessalonians 4:15-18 (KJV). No where there do we see Satan’s reign coming to an end, in fact, we see the appearance of Antichrist just two chapters after the Rapture in Revelation 6:1. Compare that with all the places that mention the Second Coming, which ends in Satan being bound for a thousand years. (Revelation 20:1-4 KJV). JESUS DOESN’T LAND AT THE RAPTURE: Paul tells us in both 1 Thessalonians 4 and 1 Corinthians 15, that the Body of Christ is brought UP to “meet the Lord in the air” in the Rapture. According to Revelation, the Church stays up with the Lord all the way until Revelation 19:14 (KJV). But at the Second Coming, it is all about Him landing on the ground, and bringing His saints with Him . THE RAPTURE BRINGS COMFORT, THE SECOND COMING BRINGS DISTRESS: The apostle Paul, teaching on the Rapture to first century Christians, said that the doctrine of the Pretribulation Rapture was one designed to bring comfort to the hearer. “Wherefore comfort one another with these words.” 1 Thessalonians 4:18 (KJV) . But not so with the Second Coming/Day of the Lord, not by a l ng shot. “Woe unto you that desire the day of the LORD! to what end is it for you? the day of the LORD is darkness, and not light. As if a man did flee from a lion, and a bear met him; or went into the house, and leaned his hand on the wall, and a serpent bit him. Shall not the day of the LORD be darkness, and not light? even very dark, and no brightness in it?” Amos 5:18-20 (KJV) . If you’re looking for comfort there, brother, you’re in the wrong place. SECOND COMING PLAINLY TAUGHT WHILE RAPTURE WAS A ‘MYSTERY REVEALED WITH PAUL: In hundreds of places all through the Old Testament, the doctrines of the Second Coming and the Resurrection of the Dead are clearly and plainly taught as doctrine. In Job, the very first book every written, we see that clearly proclaimed. “For I know that my redeemer liveth, and that he shall stand at the latter day upon the earth: And though after my skin worms destroy this body , yet in my flesh shall I see God: Whom I shall see for myself, and mine eyes shall behold, and not another; though my reins be consumed within me.” Job 19:25-27 (KJV) . So many of the Old Testament prophets, like Daniel, Jeremiah, Ezekiel, Zephaniah, Zechariah and Joel all teach the Second Coming. But though we see types of the Rapture with Enoch and Solomon (Song of Solomon 2:9-12 KJV), the Pretribulation Rapture as teachable doctrine remained a “mystery” until it was revealed through the apostle Paul. “Behold, I shew you a mystery; We shall not all sleep, but we shall all be changed,” 1 Corinthians 15:51 (KJV) . 
I love to teach on the Pretribulation Rapture because the evidence for it flows all though the Bible, it couldn’t be more clear. So why do so many “Christians” reject this doctrine? Let me go ask Jesus, He’s currently locked outside His own church at the moment (Revelation 3:20 KJV). But He promises that if I open the door unto Him, He will come in and be happy to show me a few things. 
Can’t see a Pretrib Rapture in the Bible? Maybe it’s because you got Jesus on the wrong side of the door…don’t let the Bible correctors and the “scholars” steal your Blessed Hope. Jesus is coming to get us one Day very soon, as He promised to do. Keep looking up! 
“Looking for that blessed hope, and the glorious appearing of the great God and our Saviour Jesus Christ;” Titus 2:13 (KJV)

More Electoral College Members Receiving Death Threats From Hillary Supporters Ahead Of December Voting,"NTEB Ads Privacy Policy More Electoral College Members Receiving Death Threats From Hillary Supporters Ahead Of December Voting Hillary voters around the country are bombarding Electoral College with emails, some of them threatening, in an effort to force them to vote against the outcome of the presidential election. by Geoffrey Grider November 21, 2016 A member of the electoral commission in Texas says his colleagues are getting death threats as angry Hillary supporters ramp up the pressure before electors cast their vote on December 19th. 
Hillary voters around the country are bombarding Electoral College with emails, some of them threatening, in an effort to force them to vote against the outcome of the presidential election. “At first everyone was kinda enchanted by it. Now all the electors are starting to get beaten down. There are some electors who have been threatened with harm or with death,” Texas elector Alex Kim told NBC 5. “When people ask me to vote for Hillary Clinton, there’s no way,” he said. “I reject the Democratic Party principles and I reject Hillary Clinton .” Kim said he had a message for all the people who are trying to pressure him into changing his vote; “Go to hell”. Hillary Supporters Send Death Threats to Electors: As we previously reported , another elector in Michigan said he has also received a number of death threats, including a promise that he would be shot in the head if he voted for Trump. “I’ve had people talk about shoving a gun in my mouth and blowing my brains out. And I’ve received dozens and dozens of those emails. Even the non-threatening-my-life emails are very aggressive,” Michael Banerian told the Detroit News, adding that he has been labeled a “hateful bigot” by the same people who are violently threatening him. A petition to demand electors change their vote to Clinton has also surpassed 4.5 million signatures. Meanwhile on Twitter , Hillary supporters are organizing on how to pressure electors under the hashtag #HamiltonElectors , a reference to Mike Pence being lectured by a cast member of the musical show. Unfortunately for them, conservatives found the hashtag and have now largely taken it over to decry leftists attempting to overturn the results of a democratic election. source SHARE THIS ARTICLE  ",1
HOCUS POCUS: Pope Francis Laughably Announces He Extends Priests ‘Power To Forgive Abortions’,"NTEB Ads Privacy Policy HOCUS POCUS: Pope Francis Laughably Announces He Extends Priests ‘Power To Forgive Abortions’ The letter continues: ""May every priest, therefore, be a guide, support and comfort to penitents on this journey of special reconciliation. ""I henceforth grant to all priests, in virtue of their ministry, the faculty to absolve those who have committed the sin of procured abortion."" by Geoffrey Grider November 21, 2016 Pope Francis has extended indefinitely the power of Catholic priests to forgive abortions, making the announcement in an apostolic letter released Monday. 
“For there is one God, and one mediator between God and men, the man Christ Jesus;” – 1 Timothy 2:5 (KJV) 
EDITOR’S NOTE: There is not a man on the face of the earth who has power to forgive your sins. The best anyone can do is point you to where forgiveness is, and that journey begins and ends with Jesus Christ . He shed God’s own blood on the cross at Calvary to obtain that pardon for you, and He did not “transfer that power” to any other human agency. When you step into the Catholic “confessional” and ask a man for forgiveness, you step out of that box just as dirty as you went in. Cut out the phony middleman, and go straight to the Source if you want to be clean. If you put your trust in the black-robed, “hocus-pocus” man from Rome, you will be gravely disappointed. Pun intended. 
It continues a special dispensation granted last year for the duration of the Year of Mercy — which finished Sunday — which gave all priests, rather than just bishops and specially designated confessors, the power to absolve the sin of abortion. 
While the practical effect of Francis’ announcement remains unclear, it draws attention to the prevailing theme of his papacy: That the doors of the Church must remain open, just as God’s forgiveness and mercy extend to all those who repent from sin. THE GOSPEL TRUTH ABOUT VATICAN CITY AND THE ROMAN CATHOLIC CHURCH 
That said , the Catholic Church’s stance on abortion has not changed — it is still viewed as a “grave sin.” But it makes it easier for women who have had abortions to be absolved for their actions, and rejoin the church. 
“I wish to restate as firmly as I can that abortion is a grave sin, since it puts an end to an innocent life,” the Pope’s letter states. “In the same way, however, I can and must state that there is no sin that God’s mercy cannot reach and wipe away when it finds a repentant heart seeking to be reconciled with the Father.” 
The letter continues: “May every priest, therefore, be a guide, support and comfort to penitents on this journey of special reconciliation. “I henceforth grant to all priests, in virtue of their ministry, the faculty to absolve those who have committed the sin of procured abortion.” 
“For by grace are ye saved through faith; and that not of yourselves: it is the gift of God:” Ephesians 2:8,9 (KJV) 
Forgiveness for the sin of abortion , and for all sins, is found only in Jesus Christ and Him alone.

U.N. Secretary General Complains That The ‘Masses Have Rejected Globalism’ In Favor Of Nationalism,"  U.N. Secretary General Complains That The ‘Masses Have Rejected Globalism’ In Favor Of Nationalism Antonio Guterres, elected in October to take over as U.N. secretary general next year, told a conference in his native Lisbon that this trend had undermined the willingness to receive refugees in Europe this year. He said the world must re-establish international protection for refugees coming from war zones such as Syria, but it would not be easy as developed countries were turning to nationalist agendas.   22, 2016 The incoming head of the United Nations warned on Tuesday that ‘losers of globalization’ in rich countries have felt ignored by establishment politicians, prompting them to turn to nationalist agendas, as in the U.S. election and Brexit referendum. “Therefore wait ye upon me, saith the LORD, until the day that I rise up to the prey: for my determination is to gather the nations, that I may assemble the kingdoms, to pour upon them mine indignation, even all my fierce anger: for all the earth shall be devoured with the fire of my jealousy.” Zephaniah 3:8 (KJV) EDITOR’S NOTE: The Bible clearly says that God’s desire is to “gather all the nations of the world together”, in order to “pour His fury” upon them. The United Nations, something unique in world history, has been created by the will of God, and things are going to end exactly how the Bible says they will end. All Muslims will be driven out of Israel as prophesied in Zechariah 14:21 (KJV), Israel will expand its borders to cover the size of the original land grant to Abraham , and Jesus will rule the world from Jerusalem . And that will be the “new” world order. Antonio Guterres, elected in October to take over as U.N. secretary general next year , told a conference in his native Lisbon that this trend had undermined the willingness to receive refugees in Europe this year. He said the world must re-establish international protection for refugees coming from war zones such as Syria, but it would not be easy as developed countries were turning to nationalist agendas. Antonio Guterres formally elected as UN chief: Europe has struggled to handle a huge influx of refugees, many of whom displaced by the war in Syria. The United States has accepted only a very small number of refugees and may take in even fewer next year. “In 2016, we have witnessed a dramatic deterioration of that international protection regime (for refugees),” Guterres said. “This example started in the developed world, it started essentially in Europe, it is spreading now like a virus into other parts of the world.” Guterres, who was U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees until last year, linked the growing resistance to accepting refugees to wider concerns about globalism. “I don’t think we can look strictly at the refugee issue, I think the problem is a broader problem,” he told the conference on Europe’s refugee crisis. There was a consensus in the mid-1990s that globalization would benefit all, he said. “But a lot of people were left behind … In the developed world, (there are) those who have been losers in globalization,” he said. “The recent analysis of the rust belt in the United States, I think, is a clear demonstration of that, when we speak about the elections.” Donald Trump won this month’s election in the United States in part thanks to support from voters who have seen their jobs lost to countries with cheaper labor. “So globalization has not been as successful as we had hoped and lots of people became not only angry with it, but feeling that political establishments and international organizations are not paying attention, were not taking care (of them),” he said. This led to what he called “a kind of evolution” in which anti-establishment parties now tended to win elections and referendums tended to attract majorities against whatever was put to a vote. source SHARE THIS ARTICLE  ",1
Shocking Proof That The Mainstream Media Gives You More ‘Fake News’ Than Any Satire Site Ever Will,"  Shocking Proof That The Mainstream Media Gives You More ‘Fake News’ Than Any Satire Site Ever Will Our lead-off fake news story is a classic. Filmed during the first Gulf War, it shows CNN ""journalists"" Charles Jaco and his crew pretending to be giving a ""breaking news"" update on the fighting. The only problem is that the outtakes clearly show they are not on the front lines but in a poorly decorated television studio. CNN presented this as real-life, happening now news. Completely fake.   23, 2016 In short , the current news that there should be a campaign against ‘fake news’ is of itself a fake news story. 
The progressive Left , spearheaded by the liberal media and Barack Obama, want you to be outraged over the current level of ‘fake news’ that is disseminating across the globe. What they mean when they say this is that they want satire sites, like The Onion , to be shut down. They attempt to make the laughable claim that satire sites “ changed the course of the presidential election .” But in point of fact, people are no more fooled by these sites than they are by ‘fake news’ broadcasting like SNL’s Weekend Update and The Daily Show . Sites like these fill the gap that magazines like MAD and National Lampoon did years ago. And while a random sampling of low information Americans may be fooled by these satire sites, the vast majority of intelligent, everyday people are not. 
In short , the current news that there should be a campaign against ‘fake news’ is of itself a fake news story. But this is how they distract you, much like the streetcorner magician who has you looking off in one direction while he gins up his trick in the other. 
So let’s take a look at a few times where the media and our government has deceived us with ‘fake news’ masquerading as an actual story. CNN Classic ‘Fake News’ Broadcast Pretending To Be On The Front Lines But Was Actually In TV Studio: 
Our lead-off fake news story is a classic. Filmed during the first Gulf War, it shows CNN “journalists” Charles Jaco and his crew pretending to be giving a “breaking news” update on the fighting. The only problem is that the outtakes clearly show they are not on the front lines but in a poorly decorated television studio. CNN presented this as real-life, happening now news. Completely fake. The assassination of JFK and the ‘fake news’ of the Warren Report commission: 
In 2016, there is so much information online regarding the Kennedy killing that no one seriously believes that Lee Harvey Oswald shot him or ever fired a shot at all. But J. Edgar Hoover insisted that Oswald take the fall , and the ‘fake news’ Warren Commission was hatched to advance that narrative 36 Times Obama Said You Could Keep Your Health Care Plan ‘Fake News’ Scam: 
One of the greatest ‘fake news’ scams of the modern era is hoaxer-in-chief Obama saying that “ if you like your plan, you can keep your plan “. Not only did this turn out not to be true – but – Obama was fully aware he was lying each and every time he said it. Not only that, every single media outlet in America repeated the lie, knowing it was a lie. George Bush selling the ‘fake news’ lie that Saddam Hussein had ‘weapons of mass destruction’: 
Hoo-boy, this was quite the ‘fake news’ whopper. Exactly what you would expect from the Bush Crime Family . Who helped Bush to sell this ‘fake news’ to the American public? Our old frenemies at the main stream media. How many US soldiers died as a result of this ‘fake news’ story? Right around 5,000 men and women were sacrificed for this. How our government and media use crisis actors to drive a narrative at staged horrific events: 
Of all the ‘fake news’ stories out there , this is one of the toughest to talk about. No, we are not saying that people didn’t actually die at places like Sandy Hook and other places, because they did. But that does not mean that the event that killed them was not a staged event involving paid crisis actors. So for this one we are going you a couple of videos to consider. FBI’s own statistics reveal that no one died in the Sandy Hook shooting: 
Before you go and accuse us of being “insensitive” to tragedy, take a look and see the official number of deaths in Newtown, CT, in 2012. Why are the “27 victims” of the Sandy Hook shooting not on the FBI list? Hmm…looks like the FBI agrees with us. CLICK TO VIEW THE OFFICIAL FBI WEBSITE FOR HOMICIDE STATS IN CONNECTICUT IN 2012 
By now, you can clearly see who the real perpetrators of ‘fake news’ actually are. Its brought to you by our own government, and by the crooked and corrupt pretend news media who spend 24 hours per day broadcasting stories that are various degrees of falsehood. 
And what they are so upset about this year is that because of WikiLeaks , they were unable to use their ‘fake news’ to elect Hillary Clinton as president. The American people rejected their nonsense and journalistic lies, and they were left swinging in the breeze.

Campaign chair John Podesta and counsel Marc Elias heard the complaints in a conference call last Thursday, New York magazine reports . The allegations say Clinton won 7 percent fewer votes in counties that use electronic voting, compared with counties that rely on paper ballots in the state of Wisconsin. 
The campaign was told that the margin of suspicious votes would swing 30,000 votes to Clinton’s favor. Clinton only lost Wisconsin to Donald Trump in the presidential election earlier this month by .7 percentage points, or around 27,000 votes. Hillary Clinton delivers statement on election results: The allegations also pointed to voting patterns in Michigan and Pennsylvania, states that Trump won only by razor-thin margins. 
If the results in the three states were to be overturned, Clinton would win enough electoral votes to win the presidential election. The pro-Hillary computer scientists want the Clinton campaign to contest the election results. 
Each state has a separate deadline to file a challenge, with Wisconsin’s coming first on Friday. Clinton Supporters Breaks Down in Tears as Trump wins election: Nate Cohn, a New York Times reporter, poured cold water on the New York magazine report with his own analysis. 
“Effect of paper ballots in Wisconsin goes from 7 pts, like NY article, to 0 if you control for race education, density (true w&w/o weights,),” Cohn tweeted . 
He said the same voting pattern would apply in the other two states. 
So far, there’s no indication the Clinton campaign intends to listen to the computer scientists and contest the election results. A spokesman for Clinton did not immediately respond to a request for comment. source SHARE THIS ARTICLE  ",1
Iran Warns President-Elect Trump Not To Mess With Their Sweetheart Nuclear Deal From Obama,"  Iran Warns President-Elect Trump Not To Mess With Their Sweetheart Nuclear Deal From Obama President-elect Trump once said during his campaign that he would “rip up” the agreement, drawing a harsh reaction from Khamenei, who said if that happens, Iran would “set fire” to the deal.   23, 2016 Extending U.S. sanctions on Iran for 10 years would breach the Iranian nuclear agreement, Iran Supreme Leader Ayatollah Khamenei said on Wednesday, warning that Tehran would retaliate if the sanctions are approved. The U.S. House of Representatives re-authorized last week the Iran Sanctions Act , or ISA, for 10 years. The law was first adopted in 1996 to punish investments in Iran’s energy industry and deter Iran’s pursuit of nuclear weapons. The Iran measure will expire at the end of 2016 if it is not renewed. The House bill must still be passed by the Senate and signed by President Barack Obama to become law. Iran and world powers concluded the nuclear agreement, also known as JCPOA , last year. It imposed curbs on Iran’s nuclear program in return for easing sanctions that have badly hurt its economy. Obama Announces a Historic Nuclear Deal with Iran: 
So the same guy who said you could “keep your doctor” and “keep your plan” now says this deal will solve the problem. Do YOU believe him? We sure don’t. “The current U.S. government has breached the nuclear deal in many occasions,” Khamenei said, addressing a gathering of members of the Revolutionary Guards, according to his website. “The latest is extension of sanctions for 10 years, that if it happens, would surely be against JCPOA, and the Islamic Republic would definitely react to it.” The U.S. lawmakers passed the bill one week after Republican Donald Trump was elected U.S. president. Republicans in Congress unanimously opposed the agreement, along with about two dozen Democrats, and Trump has also criticized it. Obama’s deal with Iran “worst treaty since Chamberlain”: Lawmakers from both parties said they hoped bipartisan support for a tough line against Iran would continue under the new president. President-elect Trump once said during his campaign that he would “rip up” the agreement, drawing a harsh reaction from Khamenei, who said if that happens, Iran would “set fire” to the deal. The House of Representatives also passed a bill last week that would block the sale of commercial aircraft by Boeing and Airbus to Iran. Trump and Clinton on U.S. nuclear policy, Iran deal: The White House believes that the legislation would be a violation of the nuclear pact and has said Obama would veto the measure even if it did pass the Senate. source SHARE THIS ARTICLE  ",1

Trump is the first Republican presidential candidate since 1988 to win Michigan.   24, 2016 In the closest race for president in Michigan’s history, Republican Donald Trump hangs on to a 10,704 vote win over Democrat Hillary Clinton. 
The Michigan Secretary of State posted results Wednesday that were submitted by the state’s 83 county clerks on Tuesday after the votes were reviewed and certified by each county. 
Before that compiled count , Trump held a 13,107 lead over Clinton. But after each county certified its results, the lead shrunk to 10,704, with the biggest chunk coming from Wayne County, which showed that Clinton had gotten 565 more votes than originally tallied by the county. Donald Trump FINAL CAMPAIGN Rally in Grand Rapids, Michigan: 
The state’s Board of Canvassers will officially certify the results on Nov. 28. The electoral college in all the states, including Michigan’s 16 electors, will cast their votes on Dec. 19. Electoral College and the National Archives: 
“Many people have asked about Michigan’s process for counting ballots and certifying election results. Please be aware that all 1,521 Michigan cities and townships completed ballot counting and reported unofficial results by the morning of Wednesday, Nov. 9,” according to a statement on the Secretary of State’s website. “The county canvassing boards, as they do after every election, then began their work to review and certify the results from each precinct.” 
Across the nation , Donald Trump won 306 electoral votes — including Michigan’s 16 — to 232 for Clinton. In the popular vote, Clinton holds a lead of more than 2 million votes. 
Trump is the first Republican presidential candidate since 1988 to win Michigan. The vote totals that will be submitted to the state Canvassers Board on Nov. 28 are: Donald J. Trump, Republican: 2,279,543 Hillary Clinton, Democratic: 2,268,839",1
UP IN ARMS: Trump Nation Absolutely Rejects Mitt Romney For Secretary Of State Pick,"  UP IN ARMS: Trump Nation Absolutely Rejects Mitt Romney For Secretary Of State Pick Mitt Romney, the 2012 GOP nominee, was highly critical of Trump during the campaign and called him a ""phony,"" and a ""fraud"" and dedicated an entire speech in March to denouncing his candidacy.   24, 2016 Top Donald Trump aide Kellyanne Conway said she is receiving a deluge of comments about the possibility of Mitt Romney being selected as secretary of State. 
EDITOR’S NOTE: Donald Trump made promises that a majority of the American people clearly identified with, one of which was his promise to #DrainTheSwamp . But draining the swamp involves removing the inhabitants of that swamp. Globalist Mitt Romney, keeper of the Bush Crime Family legacy, is one of the big frogs in that elitist swamp. So it stands to reason that Donald Trump could – under NO circumstances – choose Romney for any position in his cabinet. What do you think? Please comment below. 
“Receiving deluge of social media & private comms re: Romney,” Conway said, linking to a story about Trump loyalists who are unhappy with the possibility. Receiving deluge of social media & private comms re: Romney Some Trump loyalists warn against Romney as sec of state https://t.co/HDtpjeJTc3 
— Kellyanne Conway (@KellyannePolls) November 24, 2016 
She also stressed loyalty as a key trait for a secretary of State in a follow-up tweet. Conway told CNN that her tweets reflect the private discussions she’s had with Trump and Vice President-elect Mike Pence . Kissinger & Schultz as Secs of State flew around the world less, counseled POTUS close to home more. And were loyal. Good checklist. 
— Kellyanne Conway (@KellyannePolls) November 24, 2016 
“I am struck by the intensity and volume of resistance [to Romney] from the grassroots; words like ‘betrayal,’” Conway said. “I communicate with PEOTUS and VPEOTUS privately and regularly so this is not an attempt to do so publicly as some (who missed the election completely) are suggesting.” 
She said she respects “completely” that these “weighty decisions” rest with Trump, “a man whose political instincts and unconventional campaign defied the critics and made history.” 
Some Trump supporters and allies have tried to steer the President-elect from nominating Romney as the U.S.’s chief diplomat. Mitt Romney, the 2012 GOP nominee, was highly critical of Trump during the campaign and called him a “phony,” and a “fraud” and dedicated an entire speech in March to denouncing his candidacy. 
“He attacked [Trump] on a personal level about his character, his integrity, his honor,” Trump supporter Mike Huckabee said on “Fox & Friends” Wednesday. The former Arkansas governor added that it would be a “real insult” to Trump voters if Romney was nominated to be secretary of State. 
Other Trump supporters, like former Speaker Newt Gingrich , have said they favor former New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani for the job. 
“I think that, if you want someone who is going to go out and be a very tough negotiator for America and represent American interest in the way that Trump campaigned, I think that probably Rudy is the better pick and has the right temperament.” source SHARE THIS ARTICLE Geoffrey Grider NTEB is run by end times author and editor-in-chief Geoffrey Grider.

RAGING INFERNO: Tens Of Thousands Evacuated As Officials Suspect Arson In Wildfires Spreading Across Israel,"  RAGING INFERNO: Tens Of Thousands Evacuated As Officials Suspect Arson In Wildfires Spreading Across Israel On Wednesday, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu attributed the fires to ""natural and unnatural"" causes and some Israeli officials referred to an ""arson intifada"", a reference to previous Palestinian uprisings against Israel.   24, 2016 Tens of thousands of residents were ordered to leave Israel’s third largest city on Thursday as wildfires tore across central and northern Israel, and the country’s chief of police said politically motivated arson may be behind some of the blazes. Television pictures in Israel today showed a wall of flames raging through central neighborhoods of Haifa , a city of around 300,000 in the north of the country, engulfing a petrol station that firefighters were rapidly dousing with water. The fires have been burning in multiple locations for the past three days but intensified on Thursday, fueled by unseasonably dry weather and strong easterly winds. Education Minister Naftali Bennett, the leader of a far-right party, said whoever set the fires could not have been Jewish, hinting Arabs or Palestinians were behind them. Police gave no indication of who was to blame but did say they had reason to believe arson was responsible in some cases. Wildfires burning in Haifa, Israel: “There was arson and a lot of non-arson,” Police Chief Roni Alsheich told reporters. “It’s likely that where it was arson, it goes in the direction of nationalistic,” he said, suggesting a political motive, before adding: “I don’t want to disturb the investigation.” He said there had been some arrests but gave no details. On social media, some Arabs and Palestinians celebrated the fires and the hashtag #Israelisburning was trending. On Wednesday, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu attributed the fires to “natural and unnatural” causes and some Israeli officials referred to an “arson intifada”, a reference to previous Palestinian uprisings against Israel. With fires burning in the forests west of Jerusalem, around Haifa, on central and northern hilltops and in parts of the Israeli-occupied West Bank, the government sought assistance from neighboring countries to tackle the conflagration. Israel Wildfires Burning Out Of Control: Greece, Cyprus, Croatia, Turkey and Russia offered help, with several aircraft already joining efforts to quell the blaze, dropping fire-retardant material to try to douse the heaviest fires and stem their spread. A thick haze of smoke hung over Haifa, which rises up from the Mediterranean Sea overlooking a large port. Schools and universities were evacuated, and two nearby prisons transferred inmates to other jails, a prisons service spokesman said. Patients were moved out of a geriatric hospital. A lack of rain combined with very dry air and strong easterly winds have spread the fires this week across the center and north of the country, as well as parts of the West Bank. Hundreds of homes have been damaged or destroyed but no deaths or serious injuries have been reported. Bennett, the leader of the Jewish Home party which supports settlements in the West Bank where Palestinians seek statehood, said on Twitter that arsonists were disloyal to Israel, hinting that those who set the fires could not be Jewish. “Only those to whom the country does not belong are capable of burning it,” he said in a tweet in Hebrew. Haifa’s mayor said he feared for the city and called on residents with water sprinklers to turn them on to help keep the flames at bay. Those leaving their homes were urged to go to sports stadiums and other safer locations. “Each neighborhood is situated among forests and while we are proud of this, at the moment it is a problem,” Yona Yahav told Israel’s Channel 2. “There are some four major fire locations at the moment.” משתתף עכשיו בהערכת מצב עם הכוחות בשטח בחפ״ק בחיפה pic.twitter.com/So4BdYBRB6

Local weather forecasters have said the tinder-dry conditions – it has not rained in parts of Israel for months – and strong winds are set to continue for several days and they see little prospect of normal seasonal precipitation arriving. “Meteorology is not responsible but it is conducive to the spread of these fires,” said Noah Wolfson, the chief executive of weather forecasting company Meteo-Tech. “The atmosphere will remain very dry, at least until Monday or Tuesday.” source SHARE THIS ARTICLE Geoffrey Grider NTEB is run by end times author and editor-in-chief Geoffrey Grider.

OBAMA’S WARS: First U.S. Serviceman Killed In Northern Syria By Improvised Explosive Device Today,"  OBAMA’S WARS: First U.S. Serviceman Killed In Northern Syria By Improvised Explosive Device Today The death marks the first time a U.S. service member has been killed in Syria since a contingent of Special Operations forces were deployed there in October 2015 to go after the extremist group.   24, 2016 A U.S. service member was killed by an improvised explosive device in northern Syria on Thursday, the Pentagon announced in a statement. 
The service member was killed near Ayn Issa , a town roughly 35 miles northwest of the Islamic State’s self-proclaimed capital of Raqqa . The death marks the first time a U.S. service member has been killed in the country since a contingent of Special Operations forces were deployed there in October 2015 to go after the extremist group. Obama last week talking about his failure to lead in Syria: 
“The entire counter-[Islamic State] coalition sends its condolences to this hero’s, family, friends and teammates,” said Lt. Gen Stephen Townsend , the commander of the U.S.-led coalition fighting the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria. “On this Thanksgiving please be thankful there are service members willing to take up the fight to protect our homeland from [the Islamic State’s] hateful and brutal ideology.” The Pentagon usually waits 24 hours before releasing the name of a casualty to ensure proper notification to the service member’s family. 
There are roughly 500 U.S. troops in Syria , mostly operating in support role to a coalition of Arab and Kurdish fighters fighting the Islamic State known as the Syrian Democratic Forces, or SDF. Earlier this month, Secretary of Defense Ashton B. Carter announced that the SDF had begun the initial operations to isolate and eventually retake Raqqa. source SHARE THIS ARTICLE Geoffrey Grider NTEB is run by end times author and editor-in-chief Geoffrey Grider.

"Animal Protein, Pregnancy, and Childhood Obesity","Animal Protein, Pregnancy, and Childhood Obesity VN:F [1.9.22_1171] Close Transcript Transcript: Animal Protein, Pregnancy, and Childhood Obesity 
Below is an approximation of this video’s audio content. To see any graphs, charts, graphics, images, and quotes to which Dr. Greger may be referring, watch the above video. 
If you expose pregnant crickets to a predatory wolf spider, her babies will hatch exhibiting increased antipredator behavior—and, as a consequence, improved survival from wolf spider attack. The mother cricket appears to be able to forewarn her babies about the threat when they were still inside her, so they would be pre-adapted to their external environment. 
This even happens in plants. If you grow two genetically identical plants—one in the sun, one in the shade—the sun-grown plant will produce seeds that grow better in the sun, and the shaded plant will grow seeds growing better in the shade, even though they’re genetically identical. So, what we’re dealing with is epigenetics—external factors changing gene expression. 
Vole pups born in the winter come out growing thicker coats. Vole mothers are able to communicate the season to their babies in utero, and tell them to put a coat on, even before they’re born. And people are no different. You know how some people have different temperature tolerances, resulting in battles of the bedroom—do you turn the AC on or off; open the windows? It’s not just genetics. Whether you’re born in the tropics or in a cold environment determines how many active sweat glands you have in your skin. 
But what does this have to do with diet? Can what a pregnant woman eats permanently alter the biology of their children in terms of what genes are turned on or off throughout life? Or, what they don’t eat? 
What happened to the children born during the 1945 Dutch famine imposed by the Nazis? Higher rates of obesity fifty years later. The baby’s DNA gene expression, reprogrammed before birth to expect to be born into a world of famine, to conserve calories at all cost. But, when the war ended, this propensity to store fat became a disadvantage.   and don’t eat doesn’t just help determine the birth weight of the child, but the future adult weight of the child. 
For example, maternal protein intake during pregnancy may play a role in the obesity epidemic—but not just protein in general. Protein from animal sources, primarily meat products, consumed during pregnancy may increase the risk of their children growing up overweight. Originally, they thought it might be the IGF-1—a growth hormone boosted by animal product consumption—that may increase the production of fatty tissue. But weight gain was tied more to meat than dairy. 
Every daily portion of meat intake during the third trimester resulted in about an extra percent of body fat mass in their children by their sixteenth birthday, potentially increasing their risk of becoming obese later in life, independent of how many calories they ate, or how much they exercised. But no such link was found with cow’s milk intake, which would presumably boost IGF-1 levels just as high. 
So, maybe, instead it’s the obesogens in meat—chemicals that stimulate the growth of fatty tissue. Emerging evidence demonstrates that environmental factors can predispose exposed individuals to gain weight, irrespective of diet and exercise. After all, even our infants are fatter—you can’t blame that on diet and exercise. Animals too. And not just our pampered pets, even rats in labs and subways. The likelihood of 24 different animal populations from eight different species all showing a positive trend in weight over the past few decades by chance is less than one in a million. And so, it appears there’s something else going on—like obesogenic chemicals. 
One such candidate is polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons—found in cigarettes, spewing out of exhaust pipes, and in grilled meat. This nationwide study of thousands found that the more children are exposed, the fatter they tended to be. They could measure the level of these chemicals right out of their urine. And, it can start in the womb. Prenatal exposure to these chemicals may cause increased fat mass gain during childhood, and a higher risk of childhood obesity. 
If these pollutants sound familiar, I’ve covered them before, in relation to increasing breast cancer risk in the Long Island Breast Cancer Study Project. So, maybe they’re not just obesogens, but carcinogens as well—perhaps explaining the 47% increase in breast cancer risk among older women in relation to a lifetime average of grilled and smoked foods. 
If you look at one of the most common of these toxins, smokers get about half from food, and half from cigarettes. But for nonsmokers, 99% comes from diet. The highest levels are found in meat, with pork apparently worse than beef. But, as you can see, even dark green leafies, like kale, can get contaminated by pollutants in the air. So, don’t forage your dandelion greens next to the highway, and make sure to wash your greens under running water. 
Now, these are fat-soluble pollutants, so need lots of fat to be absorbed. So, even heavily contaminated plant-based sources may be safer, unless you pour lots of oil on your food—in which case the toxins would presumably become as readily absorbed as the toxins in meat. 
The good news is that they don’t build up in your body. If you expose people to barbecued chicken at time zero here, you can see they get a big spike in these chemicals, like up to a hundred-fold increase, but your body can get rid of it within about twenty hours. 
The problem, of course, is that people who eat these kinds of foods every day may constantly be exposing themselves—which may not only affect their health, and their children’s health, but maybe even their grandchildren’s health. 
Being pregnant during the Dutch famine didn’t just lead to an increase in diseases among their kids, but even, apparently, their grandkids. So, what a pregnant woman eats now may affect future generations. 
The issue of generation-spanning effects of poor conditions during pregnancy may help shed some light on the explosive epidemics of diabetes, obesity, and cardiovascular disease associated with this transition towards Western lifestyles.

Wow! I’m speechless for once! This falls under the category of mind-blowing for me. NFmoderatorRenae 
It’s fascinating right?! HaltheVegan 
Fascinating stuff for sure. I’ve heard of epigenetics, but this takes it one step further. I’ll have to watch this video a few more times for all this to sink in :-) First question that arises: can the gene expression be changed somewhat after the child is born by what the child eats? This video implies they’re stuck with the gene expressions that are inherited at birth, depending on what the mother was exposed to. Joanne B, RD 
Hi HaltheVegan – some food for thought …. have you heard of the expression, “genes load the gun, the environment pulls the trigger” ? plant_this_thought 
Strictly speaking, epigenetics concerns itself only with traits that are not inherited. It has to do with gene expression as influenced by environmental factors. The fetal environment influences genetic expression in the unborn baby, and whatever environment the newborn and growing child encounters will continue to affect, for better or worse, its genetic expression. :) baggman744 
Not inherited? plant_this_thought 
baggman744: Correct. Two individuals with identical DNA can exhibit very different traits depending on their environment. These differences are then said to be attributable to epigenetic factors, and in many cases they are reversible. It becomes more complicated when epigenetic factors result in a genetic mutation, an actual change in the DNA. Genetic changes have roughly 100,000 times the permanence of epigenetic ones. NFmoderatorRenae 
I just wrote the same thing haha I love it! Wade Patton 
The sooner we all move away from the idea that genetics are a “LOCK” on anything, the sooner well have a better understanding of the interplay amoungst all the factors affecting expression. I read a good book on it just a few years back, but cannot recall the title at this moment. Blair Rollin 
T. Colin Campbell talks a lot about this in “The China Study” and “Whole”. Mutated genes aren’t a problem if they don’t express themselves. Cancer cells aren’t a problem if they don’t proliferate. This is obviously true. But, my understanding of, what Campbell says is that what causes expression of mutated genes and what causes cancer cell proliferation is animal protein. Particularly bad is casein, dairy protein (we have learned also on NF how dangerous dairy is in other ways). He says that a very small percentage of cancers are genetic. (Just a couple of percent as I remember?) NFmoderatorRenae 
The best explanation I have heard is from Dr Neal Barnard- ‘Genetics load the gun, but diet/environmental/lifestyle pull the trigger’. So genes may give you predispositions, but in most cases (particularly with chronic diseases) YOU still have the CHOICE as to what the outcome is :) HaltheVegan 
Thank you for the explanation. That is the understanding I had before I watched this video. I remember the Dean Ornish study where cancer genes were “turned off” with a plant based diet. So I still agree with the interpretation that genes can expressed or not expressed due to diet (ie. internal environment). But what threw me off in this video is the statement: ” even our infants are fatter—you can’t blame that on diet and exercise.” This statement seems to be saying that the infants were fatter regardless of what they ate or how much exercise they got. Similarly with the sweat gland example in the video. If one is born in a cold environment, then the person will have fewer active sweat glands. Do the inactive sweat glands become active when one moves to a warm climate? How long would it take? Or will the person always feel hotter because he/she has fewer active sweat glands. These are simply rhetorical questions. Seems to me this is a very fertile area for continued research! Alexandre 
Ok but werent they during the famine eating less of animal protein? Im confused Tom Goff 
They were eating fewer calories overall so yes they were consuming less animal protein. 
It is important to remember that most things don’t usually have just a single cause. Starvation in parents.may predispose offspring to obesity. Chronic exposure to polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons by parents may also predispose offspring to obesity. Alexandre 
I understand that.. but its still confusing.. so the best way to make sure your kids wont be obese is to be obese yourself so their body wont feel the need to store as much energy? confusing Tom Goff 
No. It does not follow that parents must be obese so that their children are not. 
In fact there is some evidence from animal studies that, if you do not want your children to be obese, you must not eat a high fat diet. 
The best thing that you can do is maintain a healthy weight, eat a healthy diet and follow a healthy lifestyle. And teach your kids to do the same. plant_this_thought Lori Tompkins 
I’m 99% vegan and I’ve recently read about the woes of Lectins, which my vegan diet is high in. I don’t see Lectins discussed on this site and would really like Dr. Greger’s take on this subject. A low lectin diet seems to be more meat oriented. Thea 
Lori Tompkins: I found one blog post on NutritionFacts which talks about lectins. Here is a quote: 
“Modern paleo advocates claim that these foods weren’t part of Paleolithic-era diets, but new research challenges that assumption.5 They also argue that lectins naturally present in these starchy foods are harmful to human health. Consuming too many lectins can cause significant gastrointestinal distress. However, because legumes and grains are almost always consumed in a cooked form—and lectins are destroyed during cooking—eating beans and grains doesn’t result in lectin overload. Sprouting also reduces lectin levels in plants, although not as effectively as cooking. Generally, pea sprouts, lentil sprouts, and mung bean sprouts are safe to consume, as are sprouted grains, which are naturally low in lectins. Most larger legumes contain higher amounts and should be cooked. ” from: http://nutritionfacts.org/2014/09/23/will-the-real-paleo-diet-please-stand-up/ 
Since I eat my grains and legumes cooked, I consider the lectin brouhaha to be much ado about nothing. Todd 
@disqus_EXJURIXKLQ:disqus I don’t think it’s quite true that lectins are destroyed during cooking, but they are significantly reduced, and the more thoroughly they are cooked the more the lectins are reduced. But many lectins are fairly heat resistant, so it’s not an all-or-nothing situation. I’ve noticed that occasionally when I cook black beans in the Instant Pot, I get some transient gastric distress, probably because they weren’t quite well done enough. 
There is one thing, however, that consistently causes me to have gastric distress: ground flax seed. I know it’s an important source of omega-3, but when I put it in food I invariably experience a stomach ache for ten or fifteen minutes. I’m pretty sure it’s the lectin content. 
I think there’s still a lot we don’t understand about how lectins affect the body. We tend to assume that they are “bad,” since they are part of the plant’s self-defense against being eaten. But we used to say the same about phytates, which we now know to have positive aspects as well for health. Thea 
Todd: I don’t have any references one way or another to say whether or how much cooking destroys lectins. Brenda Davis and Vesanto Melina are usually pretty careful with their words on these topics, but maybe they got lazy in that sentence and only some lectins are destroyed. Either way, I’m not aware of a body of evidence that says the general human population needs to worry about the lectin content of our cooked beans, intact grains, or raw nuts and seeds. 
Of course, if you are getting a reaction from eating a certain food, say ground flaxseed, you need to consider that situation regardless of what is in the flaxseed that is causing it. I wonder if you ate your flaxseed in something cooked (like a muffin?) if that would help your tummy issue??? I have no idea if that’s a good suggestion or not. Just trying to be helpful. Vege-tater 
Mind blown here too, the poor grandkids! Pretty disconcerting also how many potent chemicals are now ubiquitous and the myriad of effects…and we are supposed to be the brainy species? NFmoderatorRenae 
Scary isn’t it?! Heidi 
Interesting. However, this does not account for the fact that Americans have been eating animal protein going back to the 1800s. However, the obesity epidemic has only started in the 1980s. People were consuming a lot of animal protein in the 1950s and 60s, but very very few Americans were obese. You can tell by looking at the photos of that time as well. However, the difference came with the addition of sugars and high fructose corn syrup as well as a high intake of fatty carb rich foods like fries and chips. Fructose is leading contender. We can see the rise in obesity related to the rise in sugar consumption world wide. Hunter gatherer societies that consume animal protein but do not consume processed sugars do not gain weight and are no obese. However when those people are introduced to processed foods with sugars added they immediately gain weight and become obese. When looking at the overall picture, fatty meats, fried chicken and fish for sure would be a factor, but the sugars issue shows a much closer connection to the problem. linda 
hello Heidi, I thought you might be interested in this usda brochure that tables the increase in meat since the 1950s as 57 lbs per person per annum to the year 2000.

This video by Dr. G. is very educational about Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons and childhood obesity. Also Heidi you make a good point about sugar and sugar industry in contribution towards obesity in the 1980’s era to which I also like to add salt, processed food, meat, dairy, egg industries have great part to play in confusing general public about nutrition.

If you look at Agricultural data, the amount of animal products consumed has increased greatly since the 1800s. John 
The size of the animals is larger, they aren’t running around on pasture, they are creating an environmental mess, and it is cheaper to eat this kind of meat. John S Tom Goff 
This is just keto and paleo ideology. There is no solid science to support it apart from some spurious observational correlations, misrepresented studies and industrial-strength speculation. People may have been consuming a lot of animal protein in the 1950s and 1960s but cardiovascular disease death rates were very high then. There was less obesity simply because people consumed fewer total calories then than in later decades..",1

In a study of the dietary advice given by newspapers in the UK, “no credible scientific basis” was found for most claims. The “[m]isreporting of dietary advice” was found to be “widespread and may contribute to public misconceptions about food and health.” And, potentially, not just the public. 
Scientists like to think they’re not influenced by popular media, but this study decided to put that to the test. Each week, The New York Times reports on scientific research, and the studies they report on end up being cited more often than those they don’t report on. Ah, so, the popular press does have an impact. 
Not so fast. That’s just one potential explanation. Maybe, outstanding articles are both more likely to be picked up by media, and independently more likely to be cited. Maybe, the newspaper was just earmarking important science, and their publicity didn’t really have any effect on future studies. 
How could you disentangle the two? An event in 1978 made it possible. There was a three-month strike, in which they continued to print copies, but could not sell them to the public. So, a natural experiment was set up. If the paper was just earmarking important articles, then the strike would have no effect on the studies’ impact. But, that’s not what happened. The studies highlighted during the strike months, when no one could read them, appeared to have no impact. 
The next question, of course, is: are they just amplifying the medical information to the medical community, or distorting it, as well? 
Systematic studies suggest that many stories about new medicines, for example, tend to overstate benefits, understate risks and costs, and fail to disclose relevant financial ties. Overly rosy coverage of drugs may also result from financial ties between drug companies and the journalists themselves, who may be susceptible to Big Pharma perks. 
Scientists and physicians often blame the press. In fact, the famous physician William Osler was quoted as saying, “Believe nothing that you see in the newspapers” and “If you see anything in them that you know is true, begin to doubt it at once.” 
But, both parties share in the blame. Reporters may only have an hour or two to put together a story; and so, they may rely on press releases. And, it’s not hard to imagine how drug company press releases might be biased. But, surely, press releases from the scientists themselves, and their institutions, would present the facts fairly, and without spin, right? Researchers decided to put it to the test. 
Critics blame the media. But, where do you think they’re getting the information from? One might assume that press releases from prestigious academic medical centers would be measured, unexaggerated—but suffer from the same problems: downplaying side-effects, conflicts of interest, study limitations, and promoting research that has uncertain relevance to human health. 
For example, most laboratory or animal studies explicitly claimed relevance to human health—yet lacked caveats about extrapolating results to people. For example, a release about a study of ultrasound reducing tumors in mice, was titled “Researchers study the use of ultrasound for treatment of cancer”—failing to note “for your pet mouse.” 
Apparently, it’s been estimated that less than ten percent of animal research ever succeeds in being translated to human clinical use. Overselling the results of lab animal studies as a promised cure potentially confuses readers, and might contribute to disillusionment with science. 
Although it’s common to blame the media for exaggerations, most times they don’t just make it up. That’s what the research institutions are sending out in their own press releases. And, medical journals, too. Sometimes, medical journal press releases do more harm than good. An analysis of press releases from some of the most prestigious medical journals found the same litany of problems. 
I don’t think most people realize that journals sell what are called reprints, copies of the articles they print, to drug companies, which can bring in big bucks. Like, drug companies may buy a million copies of a favorable article. Sometimes, the company will submit an article, and promise to buy a certain number in advance—which is effectively a bribe, notes a long-time editor-in-chief at the prestigious British Medical Journal . He remembers once when a woman from a public relations company rang him up, and stopped just short of saying she would go to bed with him if they published the paper. 
Another medical journal conflict of interest relates to advertising—a major source of income for many journals. Most of the advertising comes from pharmaceutical companies. And, so, if they don’t like a study, they can threaten to withdraw their advertising—potentially leaving editors faced with the stark choice of agreeing to bury a particular piece, or seeing their journal die. 
Even if journalists have time to skip the press releases, and go straight to the source, and try to read the studies themselves, they may find them utterly incomprehensible gobbledygook. But, even if they do understand them, scientific articles are not simply reports of facts. Authors often have many opportunities to add “spin” to their scientific reports—defined as ways that can distort the interpretation of results, and mislead readers, either unconsciously, or with willful intent to deceive. 
What these researchers did was look at randomized controlled trials with statistically nonsignificant results—meaning some drug, for example, was compared to a sugar pill, and the difference between the newfangled treatment and placebo was essentially nonexistent. Would the researchers just lay out the truth, and be, like, well, we spent all this time and money, and in terms of our primary outcome, we got nothing. Or, would they try to spin it? In 68% of cases, they spun. There was spin in the abstract, which is like the summary of the article. And this is particularly alarming, because the abstract is often the only part of an article people actually read. 
And so, no wonder the media often gets it wrong. Spin in the abstracts can turn into spin in the press releases, and results in spin in the news. Therefore, even if journalists are doing their due diligence, using the original abstract conclusion in good faith, they still run the risk of deceiving their readers. 
Researchers presenting new findings could always be careful to stress how preliminary the findings may be. But, let’s be serious, powerful self-interests may prevail. 
Finally, though, I think the biggest problem with the way media reports on medicine is the choice as to which stories are covered. In 2003, SARS and bioterrorism killed less than a dozen people, yet generated over a hundred thousand media reports—far more than those covering the actual greatest threats to our lives and health. 
In fact, ironically, the more people that die, the less it appears something is covered. Our leading #1 killer is heart disease. Yet, it can be prevented, treated, and even reversed with diet and lifestyle changes. Now that is something that deserves to be on the front page.

How Smoking in 1956 is Like Eating in 2016,"  VN:F [1.9.22_1171] 
  Close Transcript Transcript:   
Below is an approximation of this video’s audio content. To see any graphs, charts, graphics, images, and quotes to which Dr. Greger may be referring, watch the above video. Most deaths in the United States are preventable, and related to nutrition. According to the most rigorous analysis of risk factors ever published, the Global Burden of Disease study, funded by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, the number one cause of death in the United States, and the number one cause of disability in this country, is our diet—which has bumped tobacco smoking to number two. Smoking now only kills about a half million Americans every year, whereas our diet now kills hundreds of thousands more. So, if most death and disability is preventable, and related to nutrition, then obviously, nutrition is the number one thing taught in medical school; right? It’s the number one thing your doctor talks to you about. How could there be such a disconnect between the science, and the practice, of medicine? Let’s do a thought experiment. Imagine yourself a smoker back in the 1950s. The average per capita cigarette consumption was about 4,000 cigarettes a year. Think about that. In the 1950s, the average person walking around smoked a half pack a day. The media was telling you to smoke. Famous athletes agreed. Even Santa Claus cared enough about your throat to want you to smoke. I mean, you want to keep fit, and stay slender; so, you make sure to smoke. And eat lots of hot dogs to keep trim, and lots of sugar to stay slim and trim—a lot less fattening than that apple there. I mean, sheesh. Though apples do “connote goodness and freshness,” reads one internal tobacco industry memo, which brings up many possibilities for making “youth-oriented” cigarettes. They wanted to make apple-flavored cigarettes for kids. In addition to staying fit and slender, and soothing your throat, “For digestion’s sake,” you smoke. I mean, “No curative power is claimed for [by] Philip Morris—but [hey], an ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure.” Better be safe than sorry, and smoke. Like eating, smoking was a family affair. “Gee, Mommy, you sure enjoy your Marlboro! You’re darn tootin’. Just one question, Mom: can you afford not to smoke Marlboros?” In the 1950s, your kids were giving you cigarettes. Even your dog was giving you cigarettes. “Blow in her face and she’ll follow you anywhere.”“No woman ever says no.” They’re “so round, so firm, so fully packed.” After all, John Wayne smoked them (until he got lung cancer and died). Back then, even the Paleo folks were smoking, and so were the doctors. Now, this is not to say there wasn’t controversy within the medical profession. Yes, some doctors smoked Camels, but other physicians preferred Luckies. So, there was some disagreement. “Eminent doctors, on high and impartial medical authority, call for Philip Morris.” Even the specialists couldn’t agree which cigarette was better for your throat. So, best to stick to the science. And, more scientists smoke this brand. This should not be rocket science—but even the rocket scientists had their favorite: for “the man who thinks for himself.” We know why the AMA may have been sucking up to the tobacco industry, refusing to endorse the Surgeon General’s report on smoking, after they were handed a ten million dollar check from the tobacco industry. But, why weren’t more individual doctors speaking out? Well, there were a few gallant souls ahead of their time, writing in, as there are today, standing up against industries killing millions. But, why not more? Maybe, it’s because the majority of physicians themselves smoked cigarettes—just like the majority of physicians today continue to eat foods that are contributing to our epidemics of dietary diseases. What was the AMA’s rallying cry back then? Everything in moderation. Extensive scientific studies have proven “smoking in moderation”—oh, that’s fine. Sound familiar? Eating the Standard American Diet today is like being a smoker back in the 1950s. Most everyone you know eats this way. It’s normal—it’s what they feed people in hospitals, for gosh sake. But, you don’t have to wait until society catches up with the science again. Sometimes, it takes a whole generation for things to change in medicine. The old guard of smoking physicians and medical school professors die off, and a new generation takes its place. But how many patients need to die in the interim? Please consider volunteering to help out on the site. Close Sources Video Sources vegetarians Doctor's Note 
In this video, I try to answer the question that surely must occur to anyone even dipping their toes into the lifestyle medicine literature: “Wait a second, if this were true, why didn’t my doctor tell me?” If, for example, our #1 killer can be reversed through diet, why isn’t it front page news, taught to every medical student, broadcast from every mountaintop by medical organizations and government dietary guidelines? Still confused? Check out my other videos that address these questions: 
Is the risk of smoking and the Standard American Diet really comparable, though? See Animal Protein Compared to Cigarette Smoking .

Kickstarter? :) I would chip in. Gatherer 
When Dr Greger isn’t limited to a short video he can make his points even more obvious! For a longer version of the content in today’s video see the last part of “Food as Medicine: Preventing and Treating the Most Dreaded Diseases with Diet”. Start at 54:46 and go to 1:12:20. I love the quotes by Dr Neal Barnard and Dr Kim Williams near the end. Plantstrongdoc M.D. 
The only thing I remember from medschool regarding nutrition was my professor in cardiology saying that it is impossible to bring down the cholesterol with diet alone, you need medication, and my professor in haematology saying that it is probably healthy to be a vegetarian, but you will surely develop anaemia, and them I remember a very skilled cardiologist who inhaled huge amounts of cake between the angiograms, not to mention the child oncologist who was a heavy smoker, wrinkled in his face like a raisin and his skin had a slightly yellow tone. When I was an intern, one of my collegues brought his own dinner – chips and coke. Regarding nutrition: DONT LISTEN TO YOUR DOCTOR! The chance that he or she on the field of nutrition is an ignorant is probably near 100% plant_this_thought 
The interns at the hospital I used to work at were always boasting about how little sleep they got, how crappy their diet was, etc., competing to show how much they could abuse their own bodies, as if this somehow showed their commitment to the profession of helping others to get well. lemonhead 
I’ve always wondered if, due to the harsh conditions of medical training, there’s selection for particularly physically robust people and that they would, perhaps, be less sympathetic to people prone to illness having not experienced such states themselves. Ryan 
Even if they taught more nutrition in medical school it wouldn’t help much if they keep using the current batch of nutrition textbooks. I’m in college for nursing right now and they’re covering nutrition in my class *right now* and I’m having to tune it out to keep myself from interrupting class on how dangerous and outdated the information they’re teaching is. 
Meat and dairy is being referenced as safe and nutritious food. There is hardly mention of how diet impacts health other than preventing deficiencies and obesity. Vegans are lumped in with vegetarians and are only mentioned because of the risk of b12 and vitamin D deficit. I can go on and on… it’s infuriating. 
I don’t know whether it’s more frustrating that a whole generation of new nurses is being prejudiced against a whole plant foods diet or that the professors who say ‘evidence-based practice’ in every other breath won’t bother changing the curricula to match the science. Plantstrongdoc M.D. 
Good point. Places where nutrition is taught, it is not exactly Greger, Esselstyn, McDougall, Klaper they refer to.“Meat and dairy is being referenced as safe and nutritious food”– OK there is still a long way.“nutritional deficiencies (probably referring to vitamin and minerals) – which century does the teachers come from? :-) Ryan 
Well the one professor jokes that she used to work with Florence Nightingale… Betsy 
I’ve been eating about 97% vegan for 8 years or so based on the writings of the docs you mentioned, but now I’m very confused because docs like Mark Hyman who is well respected in the functional medicine field and works at the Cleveland Clinic, studies showing to eat more fat – granted its fat like avocado/coconut oil and he says not to eat it with unhealthy carbs, but his talks with other professionals on his Fat Summits don’t seem to be in alignment with the docs you mentioned. In fact I know Dr. Esselstyn thinks all oils are a waste of calories. Mark said on one of the videos that his LDL has gone way up from eating so much coconut oil, but these folks are citing studies too. It’s very confusing. Thea 
Betsy: . When all is said and done, Hyman is citing studies, but he is misleading people in various ways when he does it. VegCoach found the following 4 minute video about one of Mark Hyman’s claims that demonstrates my point. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RovJRlTbsgw&feature=youtu.be . Also, the following post from Tom Goff looks into some of the other of Hyman’s claims. http://nutritionfacts.org/2016/03/22/the-effects-of-dietary-cholesterol-on-blood-cholesterol/#comment-2584872026 . I agree that it *is* terribly confusing for most people. It really frustrates me that a lack of integrity and basic human decency is affecting the very lives of so many people. Jean 
Am I the only one that at 100% volume can barely hear this video? Thea 
Jean: The volume is working fine for me and no one else has mentioned the volume as being an issue. . I’m not sure if this will be worth it to you or not, but you might narrow down the issue by trying other recent videos on this site to see if you experience the same problem and then try a video or two on a different browser. Maybe whatever you find out with these experiments will help you narrow down the problem??? . Sorry I don’t have anything more concrete for you. John 
I did have to turn it up in order to hear all the words on a technical subject. John S docbeccy 
I agree! When Dr. Hyman’s book on the sugar solution came out I got a free advance excerpt. I was stunned to see he recommended BACON!! I tried to engage in a dialogue as to why he thought a high fat, nitrate laden, version of cured meat belonged in anyone’s diet but I never got a response. When I visited the Canyon Ranch Spa this summer and spoke with their medical director he was very sad that one of their former medical directors was clearly less interested in patient health than other priorities. One needs to be judicious as we wade through the conflicting experts. Thea 
docbeccy: Thank you for your reply. That’s some interesting insight. . re: “…wade through conflicting experts.” One of the biggest mistakes I see people making is along the lines of false equivalencies. I see it all the time here on NutritionFacts. “You say this, but these other people say something else and they have valid points too.” There are times when a “side” is not equally valid. If you give equal weight to all sides without having the ability to filter (as most people do not when it comes to nutrition), then you can end up confused and/or finding a balance between two view points which is not actually reasonable/balanced/based on the evidence. . I wish there was a way to help people see through this, but I don’t think there is at this time. People are just massively confused, often invested in that confusion, and I don’t judge them. It is tough! At some point, I think the situation will be like the smoking issue and everyone will just get it instinctively, because like the smoking issue at some point the science (and noticing the health of WFPB eaters long term) will win out. In the mean time, we can do our part to help by continuing to volunteer on NutritionFacts. :-) Plantstrongdoc M.D. 
Well – I think it is important to look at the big lines, because there are small differences between what these great docs (and others) recommend. E.g. McDougall is very fond of starches and has nothing against a little salt, Furhmann is very fond of beans and vegetables, for some a little processed oil is OK, For Ornish small amounts of egg white is OK and so on. Common to them is they recommend a mostly vegan diet – I think that is the important point John 
Hi Betsy, I have been saying this for a long time. You’ll never see this here, but other scientists critique Dr. Greger’s finding the same way as Thea does about Dr. Hyman below. I just try to listen to all of them that seem to have substance and sift them through my own filter. John S Thea 
John S: Did you watch that 4 minute video? I’ve never seen Dr. Greger make a claim about a study where the study actually says the very opposite of Dr. Greger’s claim–not the way that Dr. Hyman did. I highly recommend watching that 4 minute video. John 
Yes, I did watch the 4 minute video. I also saw the Klaper video. I was only allowed to see the viewpoint of the person making the video, and he wasn’t honest about what Dr. Hyman actually said. Hyman was talking about calories burned by people when they ate different things,and the video never addressed the issue that Hyman brought up. John S Thea 
John: FYI: I looked into this video in the past. I went to Hyman’s site and I read his claims and then examined the claims in the video. I do not remember see any discrepancies. Anyway, glad you got to see the video. . Note, I did not reference a Dr. Klaper video in the above post. I don’t know what you are referring to. Kwarya 
Was just telling MY nursing professor the same sort of thing today when our book and her lecture were touting certain foods, most if which fall in the “animal products” category! There is never a single reference in my nursing books to a healthier lifestyle other than going “low fat” (with the SAD). Misterimpatient 
For the record, John Wayne died of stomach cancer (1979) not lung cancer. He had a lung removed in 1964 due to lung cancer. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Wayne Plantstrongdoc M.D. 
Smokers also have an increased risk of stomach cancer. Misterimpatient 
Thank you. I understand that. The video says he died of lung cancer, which is not correct. Rhombopterix 
he got lung cancer: true and he died: true 
how does your comment help us? Misterimpatient 
If there is one thing we count on from nutritionfacts.org it is accurate information. Go to 3:10 in the video and consider the content “…until he got lung cancer and died.” An honest listener will hear this and think that lung cancer was the cause of death. In fact, stomach cancer was the cause of death in very source I found. 
So how does my comment help? It attempts, without contempt for others, to correct verifiably incorrect information in the video. Thea 
Misterimpatient: I will pass this onto staff. Todd 
Good point. Attention to detail is important on a site like this. It’s possible, I suppose, that the stomach cancer that took John Wayne’s life was a metastasis of the original lung cancer, in which case the original cancer would be cited as the cause of death. But unless we know that for sure, it’s not a good idea to state that he died of lung cancer. Plantstrongdoc M.D. 
Typically lung cancer spread to the brain, bone or liver. Tired of War 
While Wayne’s 6 pack-a-day cigarette habit might have had something to do with his death, I’m pretty sure that the ultimate reason for his demise was his role as Genghis Khan, in the movie, “The Conqueror.” The film was shot downwind from active, above ground, nuclear bomb testing sites, in 1956, and quite a few of those involved in the filming succumbed to cancer in the years that followed. I fear that there are some historical personalities that one should portray, with great caution. Misterimpatient 
Well played. Very well played indeed. George 
I don’t know about you, but there is a certain amount of people for whom the truth is important. And also there are people (like our host) how ask others to point out eventual mistakes in their work. Unless you have a hostile relationship with the truth, Misterimpatient’s comment should help you, too. Colonel Forbin 
Sick world we live in. Robbin 
I think back then tobacco companies were paying off everyone now pharmaceutical companies are paying off everyone. Maybe a lot of doctors smoked back in the day, but I think a lot of doctors like their pills today. There is no money in gardening, but there is in pill popping. I think sometimes it would be easier just to eat like everyone else, then I remember I don’t want to feel like sh*t like everyone, or be on medications like everyone. Blair Rollin 
It sure would be a lot easier. I do a whole lotta kitchen time since we switched to WFPB. But then again, I’m passing most people even 30 years younger than me out on the trail. And I can stand to look in the mirror. Ellen Mulcrone 
Hello,

Below is an approximation of this video’s audio content. To see any graphs, charts, graphics, images, and quotes to which Dr. Greger may be referring, watch the above video. 
“Natural bubbling or sparkling mineral waters have been popular for thousands of years.” Manufactured sparkling water has been around ever since a clergyman “suspended water over a vat of fermenting beer.”“For centuries, carbonated water has been considered capable of relieving gastrointestinal symptoms,” including tummy aches, but we didn’t have good data until this study was published. 
“Twenty-one folks with dyspepsia [an upset stomach] and constipation were randomized into two groups in a double-blind fashion” to drink one-and-a-half quarts of carbonated water versus tap water, every day for two weeks. Dyspepsia was defined as “pain or discomfort located in the upper abdomen,” including “bloating and nausea.” 
And, carbonated water improved dyspepsia, compared to still water (tap water), and improved constipation. “Drink more water” is a common recommendation for constipation, but they didn’t observe a clear benefit of the added tap water. Seems you need to increase fiber and water, rather than just water alone. But, sparkling water seemed to help. Now they were using sparkling mineral water. And so, whether these effects are due to the bubbles or minerals, we can’t tell from this study. 
There’s been a concern that carbonated beverages may increase heartburn, GERD (acid reflux disease). But that was based on studies like this, that compared water to Pepsi. Soda can put the Pepsi in dyspepsia, and contribute to heartburn. But, so may tea and coffee, in people that suffer from heartburn. That may be partly from the cream and sugar, though, since milk is a common contributor to heartburn, as well. Carbonated water alone, though, shouldn’t be a problem. 
Similarly, while flavored sparkling drinks can erode our enamel, it’s not the carbonation, but the added juices and acids. Sparkling water alone appears a hundred times less erosive than citrus or soda. So, a sparkling mineral water may successfully treat stomachache and constipation without adverse effects—unless you’re a teenage boy opening a bottle of sparkling wine with your teeth, especially on a hot day after you shake it up, placing one at risk for a “pneumatic rupture of the esophagus.” Please consider volunteering to help out on the site.

I’m trying to find ways for the videos to be more engaging than just showing study after study, but there may be a fine line between engaging and dorky :-).

Are the “rock” minerals in these mineral waters absorbable by humans? It is my understanding that the minerals in water are, basically, little pieces of rock, and our body can not utilize them. Maybe they even cause harm? A lot of debate on this one, but proponents of water low in TDS (total dissolved solids) often claim that the minerals in food are of absorbable nature, yet with the mineral it water it is just picking up pieces of rock and residue from the streams, lakes, etc. Makes me wonder about possible bogus benefits of consuming minerals through pure sea salts. Wegan 
Apparently they are absorbed.“On its website, the National Osteoporosis Foundation (NOF) states that there is no connection between the carbonation in soft drinks and bone loss and that certain carbonated mineral waters (the ones rich in calcium and those that are more alkaline) have actually been shown to improve bone health.”Feb 18, 2013 stephaniehope

I like to see your face, and I think it personalises the whole thing. I like any info – articles are good, too, and they give you time to digest the content. (No pun intended.) Yes, changing things up from time to time is good, as long as the content is easy to understand and the links are visible – or placed under the video. And thank you a thousand times for your service to people. Julie

I have been consuming at least a tablespoon of flax a day and following Dr. Gregor’s daily dozen recommendations, yet am still constipated and am having difficulty losing weight, which is a secondary goal of mine. Can anyone offer additional suggestions? EquaYona 
So you are on a plant based diet and constipated? How long have you been plant based? Do you still consume dairy? Ellie Lee-wasson 
I have been vegan for 4 years, have been eating whole food plant based for about 3 months, previously consuming larger amounts of processed vegan foods. I only “go” at most every couple days. EquaYona 
Can you increase your water consumption? Exercise is also an important factor for regularity. Are you following the exercise recommendations in the daily dozen? If you are getting plenty of fluids and exercise, you might try adding a little more fat(nuts, avocado) and try a bran cereal for breakfast or snack. It is startling that you have such a problem on a vegan, whole food diet. I generally have two BMs a day. Ellie Lee-wasson 
I try to drink about 64 ounces of water or tea a day, but, I also work in aviation. I walk about 10000 steps a day, and try to get additional cardiovascular as my job allows. But, yes, I agree it is startling, unfortunately, my current situation is a vast improvement from when I was not eating vegan. susan 
hi Ellie, I can’t add much to the excellent suggestions of EquaYona, other than to mention two things that helped me. I use 1 tbsp ground flax in my oatmeal in the mornings, but, if having issues, 1 tbsp in 1/4 cup water last thing at night before bed works wonders. The other thing is to avoid gluten free bread products if you use them at all.. I find one slice of this ‘bread’ at lunch with salad very effective. Best of luck 
http://www.mannaorganicbakery.com/item/organic-sprouted-bread-banana-walnut-hemp.html maggie 
Hi Ellie, I can suggest brown rice, beans and steamed broccoli or kale. These are hi fiber foods, sweet potatoes especially the Japanese purple potato are great has well. Bean soups are great as well. I suspect you are not getting hi fiber foods during the day. I’m pretty regular with 2 BM a day Cheryl esben andersen 
I would disagree with you . I do not think it is a lack of fiber since the person is already on a whole foods diet . It is a lack of peristalsis of the digestive tract , the contraction and relaxation of the digestive tract which moves the food or more correctly the waste products along . 2 or 3 glasses of water at body temperature first thing in the morning has helped a lot of people according to our naturepathic doctor we go too. For still sluggish movement sauerkraut juice or sauerkraut has helped the most stubborn cases . Darla Eaves 
Black coffee esben andersen 
Took me a while to go from creamer in my coffee to black , oh yeah a lot of people I know swear by their coffee. Ellie Lee-wasson 
I only drink black coffee :) susan 
yes esben I agree with the peristalsis idea.. I was given buscopan for gall bladder pain, nausea etc, but then later with continuing issues I was given Domperidone to speed up the digestive process. I then felt a lot better. The coffee is definitly necessary though. I will give the sauerkraut a try too. thank you! Jean 
I have a sluggish digestive tract caused in part by injuries to nerves and muscles; also migraine can slow down and sometimes even stop gut activity. When it doesn’t want to work properly nothing makes a difference. WFPB has made it less of a problem but there still are spells. Rebecca Cody 
Your problem is much more extreme than mine, but this works for me: I put 1 tablespoon of chia seeds in about a cup of water every morning, stir and then leave it sitting on the counter for about 10 minutes. Then, not before, add a rounded teaspoon of magnesium citrate powder. I use one called Natural Calm, which is available in health food stores. Stir it up well, add a bit of stevia if you wish, and drink it down. I used to do the same thing an hour or so after dinner at night, but it was definitely overkill, so I dropped the evening dose.

Hi, Ellie Lee-Wesson, I noticed there are lots of helpful advice regarding your issue with constipation even though you are on PBWF. You mentioned you are in aviation, does your job entails traveling on plane and being on high altitude? Because that could be the issue since going on high altitute causes dehydration a lot. Hydrating 20 minutes before meal and one hour after meal.The suggestions of chia seeds, flax seed, psyllum and magnisum and dissolving in warm water are very good. Also pineapple juice, prune juice also 1 table spoon good extra virgin olive oil and coffee tend to help with the bowel movement. Also having fruit one hour before meal or two hours after meal can be helpful. Ellie Lee-wasson 
Yes, I am on planes 12-14 hours a day most days. I do drink a lot of water, both still and sparkling (as mentioned in the video). I do also drink a lot of black coffee. Do you have any suggestions for fruit that packs well for travel that I could bring with me on the plane? Or other good fibre rich foods that I could pack and can be eaten raw or in a microwave? Foroogh – NF Moderator 
I would suggest dried organic figs and prunes and raisins in a little bag. Also what I usually do when I travel make my own bag of raw whole nut mixtures. I would also try organic herbal tea cleanse before flights and after your flights to cleanse your colon. I hope these suggestion are useful and wish you safe flights. esben andersen 
Why would you think its startling. Everybody I know who has tried whole foods diet has had problems with constipation . I now have known 4 people who went whole foods. 2 tablespoons whole flax in a cup of water in the morning, plus 2 cups warm water , will normally get some movement .Also half a cup sauerkraut twice a day has solved the problem for people even ones that have had a life long problem with constipation. EquaYona 
It is startling because whole PLANT foods(I assume that is what you meant) usually means a great increase in both fiber and fluids. Although I have rarely ever had constipation in my life, my vegan diet has increased my bowel movements to 2-3 times a day. I have never heard of anyone on a plant based diet having persistent problems with constipation. Until now. ;) Blair Rollin 
I agree. I can hardly believe it would be possible. Jack Hall 
Insufficient fat on my very low-fat whole foods plant based diet nearly killed my guts. Also, I did not adjust my fluid intake to accomodate for all of the additional fibre I began consuming, which added to the problem. I was hurting so bad that I couldn’t sit without severe pain and I looked as if I had swallowed a beach-ball for days at a time regardless of how many veggies or fibrous foods I ate. 
Anyway, I hope it was the fat. My only overt fat was coming from oats and two tablespoons of flax a day. I was coming in at under 30grams fat per day. Now I have added about 1 ounce of nuts which seems to have helped. EquaYona 
Glad to hear you are feeling better. I have always consumed a lot of fluids and peanut butter and whole peanuts have been important in my diet since I was in my teens. Lucky preferences, I reckon. Darla Eaves 
Ah yes. Sauerkraut! lisa c 
Magnesium is magic. And calming. I’ve taken it in tablet and powder form, adjusting dose as needed. Rex Ashbaugh 
Ellie, I would suggest getting more ‘resistant starch’ foods in your diet. To feed the microbiome. The bulk of the stool is mostly composed of bacteria. That bacteria needs to be fed. 
http://nutritionfacts.org/video/gut-dysbiosis-starving-microbial-self/ v 
Are you being consistent in your efforts to follow Dr. Gregor’s Daily Dozen? I ask because he recommends 1.5 cups of beans per day, plus a serving of cruciferous vegetables (kale or broccoli or cabbage), plus a cup of cooked greens (more kale, or collards, romaine, etc.). Add to that some fruit and a serving of berries, plus more vegetables. When I manage to eat that way (I try to do it every day, but fall short of complying 100% most days) it makes a big difference. It’s a ton of fresh food, water, and fiber. Ellie Lee-wasson 
I try, but, as I previously mentioned, I work in aviation so hitting all of the checkmarks in the app is difficult, but I consistently hit 20 of the 24 v 
I find whole wheat pasta + cannellini beans + greens (broccoli raab or swiss chard or kale) in a garlicky vegetable broth to work very well in this department. 
I think it’s because it has the fiber + liquid all together. Maybe give it a try? It’s delicious. Hope this helps! Ellie Lee-wasson 
How do you prepare the broth? bradf 
I work in aviation as well, I travel with a thermal bag and several days of vegan food, rice/quinoa based grain salads travel well, you can call hotels ahead and check for a fridge, use happy cow to find vegan food on layovers. I use freezer packs, but this bag lets you throw in loose ice and doesn’t leak Ellie Lee-wasson 
Do you work for a mainline or a regional? I also bring my food, but, don’t often have time to eat until the evening. During the day, I try to eat fruit, beans and greens etc. At night. bradf 
mainline, typical flight is 2 hours or more so there is time to eat enroute. If you’re at a regional I could see that eating during your workday could be a problem. Ellie Lee-wasson 
Yeah, I work for a regional Gatherer 
This comment has little scientific evidence behind it. It is just a suggestion. 
With your current diet you probably eat at least the minimum recommended amount of fiber, but even that is about a third of our ancestral fiber consumption. Thus additional fiber in your diet isn’t going to hurt you. Further, if you drink some fiber before eating food you should feel full earlier during your meal. 
Accordingly, I suggest that before lunch and dinner you disperse a tablespoon (15 ml) of psyllium husks into 10 oz (300 ml) of water and drink it. The fiber should help with the constipation by providing bulk, and may slightly reduce the amount of food you eat which will, over time, help with weight loss. 
For weight loss without counting calories or feeling hungry, try the Dr McDougall maximum weight loss advice. https://www.drmcdougall.com/misc/2005nl/050100pupushing.htm Panchito 
Not everybody has the same body. There could be non dietary factors to constipation like genetic (asymmetry and development) or nervous (enteric nervous system) Jenny Barnes 
Hi Ellie, have you looked at your stress levels? A few years back I was only ‘going’ once a week, despite plenty of veggies, water and exercise. My doctor recommended looking at the stress in my life, and making sure I took time out to relax made a huge difference. Jenny Barnes 
Also, if you’re struggling to lose weight that can be due to stress – high cortisol levels make your body hold onto fat. I believe the idea is that historically if we were in a high stress situation this would make sense because this would often be accompanied by famine. EquaYona 
I like the little Dr Greger, it was a cute way to interject your joke. Foroogh – NF Moderator

Sesame Seeds for Knee Osteoarthritis,"Sesame Seeds for Knee Osteoarthritis VN:F [1.9.22_1171] Close Transcript Transcript: Sesame Seeds for Knee Osteoarthritis 
Below is an approximation of this video’s audio content. To see any graphs, charts, graphics, images, and quotes to which Dr. Greger may be referring, watch the above video. 
Ever since the 1920s, doctors have been injecting arthritis patients with gold. Evidently, “gold-based medicines have been in use for thousands of years,” and remarkably, are still in clinical use as so called disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs—meaning they can slow the progression of rheumatoid arthritis. 
Unfortunately, such drugs can be toxic, even fatal, causing conditions such as gold lung, a gold-induced lung disease. “Although its use can be limited by the incidence of serious toxicity,” injectable gold has been shown to be beneficial. But maybe, some researchers suspected, some of that benefit is the sesame oil that’s injected, which is used as the liquid carrier for the gold. 
Sesame seeds contain anti-inflammatory compounds, with names like sesamin and sesamol, which researchers suspect “may serve as a potential treatment for various inflammatory diseases.” But, these were in vitro studies. First, we have to see if it has an anti-inflammatory effect in people, not just cells in a petri dish. But, there haven’t been any studies on the effects of sesame seeds on inflammatory markers in people with arthritis, for example—until now. 
“Considering the high prevalence of osteoarthritis…and since until now there has not been any human studies to evaluate the effect of sesame in [osteoarthritis] patients, this study was designed to assess the effect of administration of sesame [seeds] on inflammation…” And, they found a significant drop in inflammatory markers. But, what effect did it have on their actual disease? 
Fifty patients with osteoarthritis of the knee were split into two groups; standard treatment, or standard treatment plus about a quarter-cup of sesame seeds a day, for two months. Before they started, they described their pain as about 9 out of 10—where zero is no pain, and 10 is the maximum pain tolerable. After two months, the control group felt a little better—pain down to 7. But, the sesame group dropped down to 3.5—significantly lower than the control group. 
The researchers conclude that sesame appeared to have a “positive effect,”“improving clinical signs and symptoms in patients with knee [osteoarthritis].” But, the main problem with this study is that the control group wasn’t given a placebo. It’s hard to come up with a kind of fake sesame seed. But, without a placebo, they basically compared doing nothing to doing something. And, any time you have patients do something special, you can’t discount the placebo effect. 
But, what are the downsides? I mean that’s the nice thing about using food as medicine—only good side effects. Though the results are mixed, there have been studies using placebo controls that found that adding sesame seeds to one’s diet may improve our cholesterol and antioxidant status. And, the amount of sesamin found in as little as about one tablespoon of sesame seeds can modestly lower blood pressure a few points within a month—enough, perhaps, to lower fatal stroke and heart attack risk by about 5%; potentially saving thousands of lives.

Gut Microbiome – Strike It Rich with Whole Grains,"That is a great video. I’m glad I watched that again. plant_this_thought 
lemonhead: Thanks for the video link. The comments for that video also included this link: ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nkFJZUIUeEA ), which strongly recommends unground grains over bread products. It may also be the case, that the higher heat of baking is more destructive to the plant chemistry than boiling or pressure cooking. plant_this_thought 
Other thoughts: 
It may be the case, that the higher heat of baking is more destructive to the plant chemistry than boiling or pressure cooking. 
A particle of freshly ground flour is still enormous compared to a bacterium, but grinding probably increases the surface area accessible to the bugs somewhat, and the seed coat probably slows down penetration, which may be a good thing. Jack Hall 
The other factor to consider is that the increase in surface area increases exposure to digestive enzymes and degradation by HCL which would increase absorption of nutrients in the small intestine rendering it less useful to bacteria once it has reached the colon. Stewart 
I would be interested in the the nature of the whole wheat rolls that were used in this study. Very often the difference in white rolls and whole wheat is minimal at best. They also tend to have added oils and frequently milk or whey. A real multi grain bread with higher fiber would likely do much better. 
I’m looking for a good whole grain bread recipe if anyone can share one. lemonhead 
I used to bake bread, but gave it up a while ago. I’ve been thinking about taking it up again and trying sprouted grains. Unfortunately, I don’t remember the recipe(s), just that I had to add extra gluten to 100% whole grain dough (and that my current oven sucks). Peter Reinhart’s books are great, you might find them at your local library. lemonhead 
Just remembered something – I’ve noticed more than one of the centenarians (7th Day Adventists) I’ve seen interviewed make their own whole grain bread using freshly ground flour. Maybe there’s something to freshly ground flour or homemade whole grain bread, or maybe it’s the fact that they have a task to do every morning that gets them out of bed and keeps them active. Thea 
lemonhead: One of my pet theories (nothing to back up that it makes a significant difference) is that home-made freshly ground flour a) will not have had as much time to lose as much nutrients and b) is not likely to be ground up quite as finely as what comes out of professional mills — and for these reasons is healthier. Even if true, I don’t know if it is healthier enough to make any kind of significant difference in health outcomes. It’s just a pet theory of mine. But I like it… Nick Presidente 
Most whole wheat rolls are about 60% whole wheat, the rest refined.. they need to keep it soft and fluffy for that selling feature. Unfortunately multigrain buns are worse, with the majority of grain being refined. 
I’ve been attempting a 100% whole grain, no oil or sugar bread. I add ground flax and molasses, with very little salt. The salt makes the rising and over proofing a major concern. Very hard to find a good recipe. Also using a bread machine is limiting, and I don’t have the tools right now to mix and bake by hand David J 
Good point – if the studies did not use intact whole grains, then that alone could be the reason no benefit was found. Also I’m wondering if the whole wheat rolls or whatever else was used had emulsifiers in them. Some research on mice has shown that emulsfiers negatively impact gut bacteria. plant_this_thought 
Nick: My understanding is that the sugar (or molasses or honey) is only there as food for the yeast (which, of course, makes the bread rise). I wonder if the sugar content could be titrated to an amount that will be completely consumed by the yeast. Blair Rollin 
1 cup whole grain spelt flour 1 1/4 cups whole wheat flour 1 1/4 cup whole grain rye flour 1/4 cup 7-10 grain cereal 1 tbsp ground flaxseed meal 2 1/4 tsp yeast 2 tsp salt (or whatever you like) 1 tbsp molasses 6 tbsp gluten 1 2/3 – 1 3/4 cups water 
I use a bread maker. Knead for 15 minutes then let sit for 20 (turn the machine off and restart it). Then follow the machine cycle for whole wheat bread. 
You can substitute any other whole grain flour for the rye and it will be excellent, but possibly not as high a loaf. Bob’s Red Mill has a big selection of whole grain flours you can try. No preservatives so it’s only good for a day or so but it freezes perfectly.I have been baking these whole grain breads for over a decade and will not willingly eat any other except whole grain Wasa bread. Once you start eating these fabulous whole grain breads you begin to believe that people can indeed live on bread and water. 
The refined ingredient is the gluten. You can reduce the amount of gluten but it’s going to get a lot flatter. (This is one of the very few refined products that I eat, so I’m okay with it for the time being.) Thea 
Blair Rollin: Thanks for taking the time to share a tried and true recipe with us! I’m not usually one for making bread, but you have me tempted with this recipe. Blair Rollin 
I assure you, I’m very much in the camp of “whole grains are better than whole grain flours”. (I guess bread is just another hangover I have from my previous SAD diet.) But I only eat one slice of bread a day usually. The stuff is very handy for making a calorie rich meal (sandwich) that you can eat while you’re driving. And it’s good for sopping up the pot liquor from my red beans and collards. plant_this_thought 
No oil in this recipe. Is oil included in standard bread recipes just as a pan lubricant? Is it not required if one uses a non-stick pan? Thea 
plant_this_thought: I don’t make enough bread to answer your question about what is standard. I can guess that non-stick pans would be one way to avoid oil. Another way is to just shape the bread in big round pillow and bake it in an oven instead of a bread machine. When you bake it in an oven, you can put it on a silicon mat or parchment paper and I imagine that no oil would be needed in that case either. (though I don’t know) . Stepping back a second. My philosophy: While I typically avoid oils in the food I cook, I’m not opposed to occasionally greasing a pan for a special recipe. I think that is a reasonable way to use oils in one’s life if I don’t have heart disease or diabetes. That’s just my approach which I’m sharing in case you would find it helpful. Ruth 
Spelt is an old fashion wheat flower that hasn’t been messed with like the regular bread wheat. Its own gluton content is much lower because of not messing with it. Your bread will be lighter using the gluton flower with it. It is the gluton stretching that helps the bread to rise. AnnieVanCookie 
You made me laugh with the “until know” thing xD!! I wonder why there’s people with sad diet and aren´t obese. I have been all my life struggling to loose weight even though I always ate “healthy”. I see people eating crap everyday and they just wont get fat. TofuAnnie 
I liked this pop-up as well! Your voice kept on as you’re mini-me pointed to the ‘until now’. It’s your signature, so why not?! I need to go back and re-watch the mircobiome videos. Thanks for your work, doc. David J 
Sorry but although I found it ok, it will keep me from sending it to skeptical people I am trying to convince to take this kind of work seriously. Nancy Altman 
It humor. Just humor. Come on, people, lighten up! It’s good for your health! Thea 
AnnieVanCookie: Why do some people get fat and some stay thin when eating pretty much the same type of SAD diet? Why do some people get or stay fat even when they try to eat healthy? It’s a great question. Dr. Lisle, one of the experts from Forks Over Knives, does a good job of answering that question at the beginning of his talk, How To Lose Weight Without Losing Your Mind: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAdqLB6bTuQ AZ DONALD 
hi thea, 
i searched and searched last night but couldn’t find the video i was looking for and am hoping you can direct me to it. 
recently, dr G changed his recommendation from methyl cobalomin to cyano cobalomin because a small percentage of people don’t absorb the methyl. 
are you able to direct me to that one? 
thanks, donald. Thea 
AZ DONALD: From my memory, Dr. Greger has always recommended the cyanocobalamin form. Here are a couple pages where you see that recommendation: An Ask the Doctor page from 2012: http://nutritionfacts.org/questions/which-type-of-b12-is-best/ General nutrition recommendations from 2011: http://nutritionfacts.org/2011/09/12/dr-gregers-2011-optimum-nutrition-recommendations/ In the new book (How Not To Die), Dr. Greger talks about recommending the cyano… form because that’s the one that is tested in studies showing that it works. We don’t have the body of evidence showing that the other forms work. . If there is a page where Dr. Greger talks about changing his recommendation on B12, I’m sorry but I’m not aware of it. kari228 
Great Share, I had never seen this before. Erica 
Would you add an even greater benefit to the mixed whole grains by chilling them before eating? I’m curious whether we would get the benefits of resistant starches with chilled whole grains. The studies we had seen previously showed a benefit when processed or refined (white) grains where cooled/chilled and then consumed. 
Yes, that works if they’re chilled AFTER they’ve been cooked. They can be reheated and the resistant starches will remain. Mike Quinoa 
What about whole grain pasta that’s not even cooked in the first place? I sometimes “cold-cook” pasta by just leaving it in cold water for a few hours, and then using it in a bean / pasta salad. David Hochstettler 
I tried making bread without flour sugar and oil for over a year and finally let it go. Now I eat a slice of ezekial bread every day to satisfy my cravings for bread and 300 grams of cooked whole wheat ,barley and brown rice in their whole form. To cook it I boil 3 quarts of water and add 3 cups of wheat berries and a 1/2 a cup each of pearl barley and brown rice and simmer for an hour. Quick cool it by running cold water through it in a strainer and bag it up in 300 gram fold top sandwich bags. Richard 
You bring out a good point: bread is addictive! I can’t find where I read it before, but wheat has some kind of morphine-like substance it it. Bread is also an SOS (salt, oil, sugar) food. In fact, the average American gets more salt from bread than any other food. Bread has a high glycemic index, higher than intact grains. Trouble is, when I’m hungry, it’s the most convenient and appealing thing in the house. That is, it was. From now on, I’m going to keep bread out of my house and have some baked potatoes or yams in the fridge. Ben 
The ezekial breads and the silver hills breads are both healthy. Vege-tater 
I often microwave a large sweet potato, then slice it and make thin “toast” for a quick “bread”. Steve Billig 
I did not see in the study descriptions whether the whole grain variety that makes a difference in microbial richness (great term) is required over the course of a day, or perhaps over the course of a week. Did anyone pick that up? susan 
good question Steve, and its an interesting answer ! the transcript says they used whole grain barley, or whole grain brown rice and the combination of the two worked better than either alone . hmm might be able to make a cold chopped vegie salad using both grains that wouldnt be bad ! hope that answers your question steve. susan 
sorry steve, I may have missed your question.. https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3744518/figure/F1/ this page details showing the number of grams per day over the course of how many weeks . Steve Billig 
Variety, to me, is one of foundations of healthy eating. Research shows that variety even trumps volume (more types of healthy foods yields better health than more volume of healthy foods). My understanding is that the way to achieve variety is to eat all the plant-based food groups (fruit, veg, grains, legumes, nuts/seeds) over the course of a day, and a variety within each food group over the course of a week (variety of nuts, or veg (crucifers/onion family/starchy family/leafy green family, etc.). Since the research only tested daily variety and not weekly variety, we do not know for sure, so in order to go with what we know, eat a variety of grains daily. susan 
Makes total sense to me steve. They achieved a better result mixing two varieties, so I would think it would be very beneficial to mix it up over the course of the week. I plan on mixing up grains in salads more often.. throwing in some lentils too, and trying new combinations. thanks Steve ! Wegan 
No, you said the t word. Ed 
Glad to see you more animated in your videos, but this one needs fireworks and music. I recently tried a newer probiotic with 115 interdependent strains, as I eat more veggies, beans,and lentils than most the changes were profound.This information can still kick my biome into another gear. Thanks. Previous Video",1
Morning Sickness May Protect Mother and Child,"Morning Sickness May Protect Mother and Child VN:F [1.9.22_1171] Close Transcript Transcript: Morning Sickness May Protect Mother and Child 
Below is an approximation of this video’s audio content. To see any graphs, charts, graphics, images, and quotes to which Dr. Greger may be referring, watch the above video. 
“Since the beginning of time, pregnant women have been [known] to suffer…nausea and vomiting [during pregnancy].”“The term ‘morning sickness’ is [actually] misleading,” since women can feel sick all day long. And sometimes, it can get so serious women have to be hospitalized. 
Researchers at Harvard’s Brigham and Women’s Hospital found that saturated fat seemed to be a primary dietary risk factor for severe sickness. Five times the odds for each 15 grams’ intake of saturated fat, like a quarter-pound cheeseburger’s worth. The reason saturated fat intake may be such a strong risk factor could be through its effect on estrogen, as “[s]aturated fat has been shown to increase circulating levels of estrogen.” 
Why would we evolve to have such a negative reaction to saturated fat? Why would we evolve to get sick at all? “Pregnancy sickness is a universal phenomenon, [with nausea and vomiting] affecting 70 to 85% of all pregnant women.” If you include food aversions in the definition, then the incidence is more like 100%. “Because pregnancy sickness is such a common phenomenon, one must question why this is so. Is there a purpose for such a potentially devastating condition?” Well, in the past, pregnancy sickness was dismissed as all just in women’s heads, but “recent…studies have reconsidered pregnancy sickness as an embryo-protective mechanism, an evolutionary adaptation to protect the [baby].” 
Protect the baby from what? Maybe from meat. “Meat is the principal source of pathogens for humans. Meat is also the most common type of food avoided by pregnant women.” So, the development of an aversion to meat during pregnancy could be protective, as “meat may have toxins that are mutagenic, carcinogenic, and teratogenic”—meaning birth defect-causing. Tainted meat may also be contaminated by pathogens, and “[p]regnancy is a time of relative immunosuppression.” Normally, we can fend off most meat pathogens; however, by design, pregnant women are immunosuppressed to not reject the developing embryo, since half the baby—from the father’s side—is foreign. 
So, maybe morning sickness evolved as a way to get us to stay away from meat during this vulnerable time. This would be consistent with a “profound overrepresentation” of taboos against meat eating during pregnancy in sample societies around the world. 
If this theory is true, then we should be able to make five predictions. If nausea and vomiting in pregnancy is there to be protective, then women who have it should have better pregnancy outcomes. And, indeed, women who experience nausea and vomiting are significantly less likely to miscarry, or suffer a stillbirth. 
Prediction #2 would be that the triggering foods contain things that can be particularly harmful to the baby. And, indeed, “[o]f all food types, animal protein (including meat, poultry, eggs, and seafood…) is the most dangerous. Meat is the source of a wide range of pathogens that pose a grave threat to pregnant women and [their developing babies].” 
Nausea and vomiting in pregnancy should also coincide with when the embryo is most vulnerable. That’s between like, you know, weeks 5 and 15, when all the critical organ structures are being formed—which is right when nausea and vomiting is peaking, which is right when pregnant women find meats, fish, poultry, and eggs most aversive. 
And, finally, if this theory is true, one would expect a lower frequency of morning sickness among plant-based populations. And, yes, the few societies where you don’t see such morning sickness problems are the ones that tend to have only plants as dietary staples, rather than meat.

So nice to have a video without pop-ins!! :) In early pregnancy my food aversion wasn’t to meat (which I didn’t eat anyway). However I did have a major aversion to peanut butter–couldn’t even take a whiff of the stuff! Maybe protection from aflatoxin? Secondary aversion was to oatmeal which had been my go-to breakfast for years. Didn’t touch either throughout pregnancy. WFPBRunner 
Something that is also curious is I had morning sickness the minute I got up but was fine for the rest of the day. If meat was the culprit wouldn’t I have been sick when the food was still in my stomach? What good would vomiting up nothing do? Julie 
Yeah, doesn’t make much sense, does it? I’ve never really thought there’s much rhyme or reason to the idiosyncrasies of pregnancy like morning sickness, food aversions and cravings.. Many of them don’t make much sense, although it would be interesting if they did. WFPBRunner 
Hormones Nick Presidente 
I wonder if our evolution is the culprit on things like this. Where we might have evolved the morning sickness as a reponse to toxins, when toxins were almost entirely from our diet. Today we wear make up, and touch chemicals among other things, who knows, maybe make up makes us throw up? It’d be interesting to see a more detailed breakdown of that. Foroogh – NF Moderator 
Yes, I think this is very interesting topic for further research. The bodies response to toxin to protect the fetus that his or her immune systems is not developed yet. Yes, our bodies are very complex system and we learn a lot from it. plant_this_thought 
Our bodies are equipped to tell us so many things, when we stop to listen. Tom Goff 
Symptoms often aren’t just messages. They are the body’s first line defences against infection and injury. Coughing expels noxious organisms, fevers kill pathogens etc etc. Suppressing symptoms may actually be counterproductive in some circumstances. plant_this_thought 
Disease, then, is not the body misbehaving, but working as designed. Darryl 
This paper offers a similar hypothesis that the reason saturated fat intake induces inflammation (in the nonpregnant as well) is that it’s an adaptive response to gut pathogens that meat promotes. 
Embyronic implantation “ resembles an open wound that requires a strong inflammatory response ” where the uterine lining is broken and endometrial tissue invaded, and this enhanced immune response is partly responsible for morning sickness. Terry 
We had 4 children and my wife got morning sickness with each one. I am not a doc and of course can’t give medical advise. But we used B-6 and the morning sickness was gone. With all 4 children. Others tried my suggestion and it worked for them too. B-6 is supposed to work for sea sickness too. Darryl 
They used 25 mg every 8 h for 3 d. nc54 
Eat a banana every 8 hours. Good source of B6. Joyce 
At the time I became pregnant with my son, my diet consisted mainly of vegetables with very occasional meals of chicken or fish. I did not experience morning sickness. However, as the pregnancy progressed, i began to crave red meat. Since I had not had any for more than 15 years, it was difficult to contemplate following through on this need. Eventually, the craving became so powerful, I purchased and ate an entire steak. I was surprised that the need persisted for the remainder of the pregnancy. Once my son was born, I reverted to a predominantly vegetarian diet. But clearly my usual diet was lacking in something required for the pregnangy lemonhead 
Same thing happened to me re: red meat. I did get morning sickness in my first trimester, though. Julie 
Same thing happened to a friend of mine. She normally hated red meat, but while pregnant she craved it like crazy! Bobbi 
I just love the pop-in images and the picture videos! what a nice way to change things up- thank you Nutritionfacts. 
This video is so interesting to me since I vomited for almost 7 months of my pregnancy and thus never had another child after my wonderfu Sebastian. I know this rationale is fact for me. It was always fried smells of any time and I literally lived on peanut butter and toast while fearing my son would then be allergic to peanuts after my high consumption, but he is 24 now and no signs of it.

Sorry, meant to write, “smells of frying or cooking meat” that made me have to literally walk quickly past restaurants and decline dinner invitations. I think the reason it turned on early in the morning and stayed all day and night for me was because that is when it needed to alert me; when I was awake. Foroogh – NF Moderator

uhg… baby center is full of pop info that aims to please everyone and anyone- not a great scientific resource….. Maria 
Oh my goodness- I love Dr. Gregor and my plant based diet but I get really upset at stuff like this… 6 weeks to the day (after eating pounds of asparagus and beans) I got debilitating nausea with my second pregnancy (that PS was quelled for awhile when I ate a high calorie/ high fat meal like…. meat. Which I wouldn’t touch until I was pregnant.) For all of you watching please don’t go around promising women they will not have morning sickness if they are plant based because it’s simply not true. I think it has more to do with changes in hormones (this is all from experience totally non scientific…). I am super sensitive to changes in hormones to the point where I get extremely nauseous at milk let down when I’m nursing (even after intercourse- which is a similar hormone “rush” if I’m not mistaken). I have searched all over for information about this but I feel like all of it is anecdotal. My biggest aversions during pregnancy were to rice, oatmeal, and whole beans (smashed was fine haha)- and it sounds stupid but I hated drinking water. I simply couldn’t eat enough calories to support myself because of the nausea. 
I didn’t try ginger or B6 but I just want to fix the cause of the nausea not put a bandaid on it…. 
As a side note I totally avoided heartburn because of the PB Diet. It was amazing!!! Had it horrible with my first but not with my second! Oil, meat, and anything processed (even a little) gave me horrible heartburn- greens and fruit rock! nire81 
I’ve had three pregnancies with severe morning sickness. The first pregnancy I was a vegetarian (for over a decade) and I threw up so much I lost weight for 7 months. The second pregnancy I was still a vegetarian and was also very sick, but threw up a little less. My third pregnancy I was vegan (for two years) and I couldn’t stand up without needing to puke, and I had issues with dehydration. I was having blood work done yearly because of my Hashimoto’s, and my nutrient levels were fine. All three times the sickness lasted the entire pregnancy and went away right after delivery. Maybe meat is one cause of morning sickness, but based on my experience I think there must be other causes as well. NutritionistMia 
I am 17 weeks pregnant with twins. I have suffered from hyperemesis gravidarum (HG) throughout my pregnancy and have been hospitalized due to dehydration before. I also am a primarily plant-based eater. While I think this theory could hold some merit since so many pregnant women experience aversions to meat and poultry, it really doesn’t begin to explain the range of nausea triggers for those of us with HG. For example, a simple car ride or a whiff of certain vegetables (especially ones that I used to love!) can induce excessive vomiting, and neither of these examples appear harmful for the fetuses. My point is I think this theory is a bit oversimplified and dismissive of a condition that is much more complex and mysterious than this video would suggest. Maria 
YES! I think pregnant women are just so widely misunderstood. It’s not JUST what you eat (maybe a factor)- maybe it’s even stress! I wonder if those other countries that are more plant based also see pregnancy as a normal part of life (not a disease like in the US) and have families who support the pregnant women (not have demanding work days and isolation from families as a normal part of the culture- not to mention a a negative view of pregnancy and children) NutritionistMia 
Agreed. Really limiting stress has been key for me, in addition to medication and monitoring by my medical team. Also in developing countries (even plant based societies in Sub-Saharan Africa and South East Asia), women can and do die of HG due to dehydration and inability to access health services. Removing meat from one’s diet is not a cure for severe morning sickness, the same way that meat is not the cause of morning sickness. It is much more complicated than that! Foroogh – NF Moderator 
Hi, I think this is great video and we can learn a lot from it and it is a subject for further research as I can understand from reading the comments different pregnancy has different issues associated with morning sickness. Vege-tater 
Interesting irony…though I never liked meat and liver gagged me, when I was pregnant I craved it nearly raw! Can make me gag now just thinking about it! I had wicked morning sickness early on and barely could hold anything down, but by the craving stage it was history. The following pregnancy was uneventful. Odd. DashnMe 
Ok, this one is way off for me. I was ill enough to be hospitalized with my first pregnancy. I was kept in for 2weeks on I’ve fluids no food the entire time and when I was released, I couldn’t eat enough hamburgers to satisfy me…and I had been a vegetarian for the previous 5 or more years!! The smell of coffee or even the smell of boiling water made me ill, the taste of water, eating lettuce made me violently ill…I hated how my taste buds changed but there it is. With my second child, I was no lo get a vegetarian but felt just as sick but managed to stay out of the hospital. And for me, it was a 24/7 illness not just morning. 
Lol, humans didn’t evolve. Keri Hanson 
Two pregnancies, two healthy sons, no morning sickness. I was vegan prior to my first, ate some chicken and fish at my Midwife’s advice during my first pregnancy, and are no meat my second. Jen 
Hello Dr. Greger – I don’t mean to be nit-picky, but its quite unclear to me (and I would guess others as well by the nature of the comments we are seeing) whether you are speaking about this subject as a hypothesis or a theory. A couple of times you stated “If this theory is true . . . “. 
As a scientist, you know that a “theory” is generally regarded as accepted fact due to a plethora of information sufficient to fully support it. A “hypothesis” is still questioned as fact and is still in the “accepting information as to its validity” stage. So I’m a little unclear as to how you are representing this set of information: as hypothesis or as theory? I think it has added to some confusion in the discussions below. 
My sense of it is that this is a hypothesis at this point but you are using the word “theory” loosely as many of us do. I wouldn’t make a point of it except that this is a fact-based site and we are seeing lots of diverse perspectives and some confusion. So I’m wondering if you could clarify for us. Love your work however! broccoli 
This is bogus info from Dr Greger under the disguise to be against meat eaters. Morning sickness has to do with hormone imbalance in pregnant women but has nothing to do with vomiting to expel meat “poisons” from the body as a “protective mechanism”. And the saturated fat theory is even more laughable. 
Even vegan pregnant women have morning sickness.",1
Why BPA Hasn’t Been Banned?,"Why BPA Hasn’t Been Banned? VN:F [1.9.22_1171] 
If the synthetic estrogen BPA is linked to billions of dollars’ worth of medical problems a year, why is it still allowed in the food supply?   Why BPA Hasn’t Been Banned? 
  
“The number of new chemicals is increasing exponentially”—we’re talking 12,000 new substances a day. Yet, data aren’t available on the hazards of even some of the high volume chemicals. BPA is one of the highest volume chemicals, with billions of pounds produced each year. And, studies have “raised concerns about its possible implication in the [cause] of some chronic diseases, such as diabetes, obesity, reproductive disorders, cardiovascular diseases, birth defects, chronic respiratory and kidney diseases and breast cancer.” 
A new study on the health implications of BPA comes out nearly every week. BPA was first developed over a hundred years ago as a synthetic estrogen. But it wasn’t until the 1950s that industry realized it could be used to make polycarbonate plastic, and it rapidly became one of the most used chemicals worldwide, even though it was recognized to have hormonal effects. About a billion pounds are also used to line food and beverage cans—especially, it seems, in tuna and condensed soups. 
And now, we basically all have BPA in our bodies, and our children’s bodies. But, not to worry; the government says up to 50 a day is safe; 50 micrograms per kilogram. And, even those working in Chinese BPA factories don’t get exposed to more than like 70 times lower than that safety limit. Okay, then, why did exposure seem to affect the male workers’ sperm counts? 
In the U.S., the general population only gets less than like a thousand times lower than the safety limit. Yet, still, we seem to be seeing “adverse effects on thyroid function, weight control, blood sugar control, cardiovascular disease, liver function, and immune function”—even at those incredibly low doses. So, “[t]he fact that there are significant adverse effects in populations exposed to BPA at concentrations [thousands of] times lower than the [official tolerable daily limit] indicates that the safe exposure to BPA may be much lower than previously thought in humans.” Yet, the limit hasn’t been changed. It’s been banned from baby bottles and sippy cups, but nearly unlimited doses are still apparently okay for everyone else. What’s the disconnect here? 
It has to do with the fascinating world of low-dose effects of hormone-disrupting chemicals. “For decades, [these chemicals] “have challenged traditional concepts in toxicology”—particularly the old adage that it’s “the dose makes the poison,” the concept “that lower exposures to a hazardous compound will, therefore, always generate lower risks.” That’s “the core assumption underlying [our] system of chemical-safety testing.” They start dosing lab animals with super high amounts, and then keep lowering the dose until whatever adverse effects disappear; then, add a safety buffer, and assume everything below that dose should be okay, assuming the curve looks like this. You know, the higher the dose, the higher the effect. But, hormone-disrupting chemicals can have all sorts of “curious curves.” Basically, how could something have more of an effect at a lower dose? 
Think about a hormone, and its receptors in the body. At low levels of the hormone, like going from 0 to 1, the receptors can fill up quickly. But, once they’re almost all filled up, going from 4 to 5, adding really high doses may not change things much. Let’s use an actual BPA example. This was a study to see if BPA suppressed an obesity-protective hormone in fat samples taken from breast reduction and tummy tuck patients. As you can see, at a hundred nanomoles of BPA (I feel like a weatherman here!), but at a hundred nanomoles of BPA, you can see hormone levels are no lower than they are at 0 BPA. And, since most people have levels like between 1 and 20, then BPA must be safe. But, here’s the actual graph. So, no suppression at 0; no suppression at 100. But, right where levels are in people’s bodies, BPA appears to cut hormone release nearly in half. 
As the world’s oldest, largest, and most active organization devoted to research on hormones concluded, “even infinitesimally low levels of exposure—indeed, any level of exposure at all—may cause [problems],” nearly three billion dollars’ worth of problems every year, just counting the estimated effects of BPA on childhood obesity and heart disease alone. 
Now, there are alternatives that the industry could use; the problem, though, is that they may cost two cents more.  ",1
Food Synergy,"Blair Rollin: Nice quote from The China Study. I had forgotten about that. Thanks! vegPat 
“It’s the sunshine vitamin. Dr. McDougall, for example, does not recommend D supplements but rather fresh air and sunshine.” if you live in Florida or the tropics maybe and also not everyone can absorb vitamin D through this process so they may have a hard time getting there levels from the sun alone, its kind of like omega 3 from plant sources, yes its there but not readily available and some people cant’ absorb it efficiently, which is why you need a marine algae oil that can be easily absorbed Vege-tater 
I heard it said that if plants and trees can photosynthesize at your latitude, generally we should be able to get enough sunshine for our less intensive human needs, provided we make an effort to actually go outside and soak up the rays. I’m originally from CT and always wondered if part of the sickly and depressive effect of winter was our tendency to “hibernate” and not go outside until you had to. When my kids were little and I was outside all winter with them sledding and playing in the snow, it wasn’t a problem, until they were old enough to go themselves, and I hung back in the dry warmth! (Now I live in FL and stay inside all summer instead! lol) Ben 
Hi Blair. I am familiar with Dr. McDougall’s opinion. Living a bit north of him I am not confident we share the same levels of sunshine opportunity. As for B12, I have never washed my organic produce, and we grow a lot of our own veggies. Our soil is fabulous. The “sanitation” hypothesis has not worked for me. And it does not explain higher b12 levels in some people eating from these poor soils. So, it’s probably a little more complicated. And, considering the risks of not supplementing, only a fool wouldn’t get tested. Our family does supplement with B12 and it did work to correct our deficiencies. So, that’s an example where a singular nutrient did work out for the body. Many people also report success with vit D and dha supplementation. Dr. Gregor is an advocate of these practices. In my mind, he needs to have his crew tackle the conflict between on the one hand steering people away from vitamin supplementation and on the other advocating vitamin/nutrient supplementation. I assume he would say something like “Hey, if after switching over to the best diet on the planet, you discover you are lacking in some essential nutrients… rather than eat animal products (which historically have provided these nutrients to humans) because our environment is so toxic, the cruelty to the animals so extreme and the long term damage done to your body… find a good provider of the micronutrients from a wholesome source. Accept the world as imperfect.” vegPat 
there is no real inconsistency Dr Greger’s book lists it out How not to Die recommends the following supplements B12 (soil no longer has it, yes you can grow in healthy soil but average person needs to supplement it) Vitamin D (because a lot of people live in northern regions and darker skin blocks good conversion) Omega 3 algae oil (plants have omega 3 but is not readily absorbed and as you get older this gets worse) WFPBRunner 
Hi Ben If you watch some of the videos under the nutrients you list you will see that non-vegans are deficient also. For example my husband rides his bike out doors 3 hours per day, eats some meat and tested below 20 for Vit D. B-12 is just so important for obvious possible neurological issues. We could always drink swamp water though. Ben 
I agree. My question is about the necessity of supplementing. My question pertains to how are Dr. Greger’s recommendations to supplement (as outlined in his book) reconciled with a video like this one making the case that supplements do not work, and sometimes cause harm. WFPBRunner 
He is pretty specific. B12 is the big one. Vit D if you live too far North or work in an office all day. Omega 3 but I believe that was across the board. WFPB or not until we know differently for brain health. Blair Rollin 
These popups keep getting better and better. Vege-tater 
I find it so amusing to read the oppositional commentary about them! Maybe I’m just old and cranky but people seem to be getting more and more entitled, and think each video is for them exclusively. I just love what Dr. G. does, and that he does it at all, for US and our benefit, from his generosity and caring! You can never please everyone, so I hope he continues to let his light shine as he sees fit and let it sort itself out. Life is full of angst and seriousness, we need all the humor we can get! Ron Ninon 
It’s somewhat supercillious to “be amused” by all the people’s comments and efforts to express their discontent, such as I am doing now in an attempt to contribute positive constructive criticism,. The fact is, for many, the “light-hearted” new format has been stated as being downright distracting and works against the intention of the video which is, surely, to educate and inform, NOT to entertain or promote some kind of clever food comedy. The new format pop-up segments can also come across as sarcastic and aloof and so the video is not worth sharing with the many who are already skeptical as it will really put them off. Even fans on here are put off! If the efficiency of transmission of information is interrupted with completely irrelevant bells and whistles doing little other than exhibiting technical prowess with video editing skills and that causes distraction, memory interference and forgetting, and for some, irritation, then that is a fact that needs considered very carefully. A handfull have said they like the format but more have said they do not. An online vote might be useful. But I would question what it is that those who like the format like and whether they have absorbed the info as well as they would have without the memory interference. There are real cognitive mechanisms at work. Just my 2500 cents worth. guest 
I find some people’s repetitive complaints to be a needless distraction. The videos are prerecorded… after this, normal programming will resume. Ron Ninon 
Typical anonymous trollololololol. Ron Ninon 
You delete my response to this but let the guest’s sarcasm remain?? Just who is guest?! Thea 
Ron Ninon: I have previously directed you to the rules for posting on this site. If you read those rules, you would know that you may not call people names. To be very specific: You may not call someone a troll. I can tell who guest is and this person has made many quality comments on this site. Leave the moderating to the moderators. . Also, I have already warned you about your comments in general. Your opinion on this topic has been noted – multiple times over. No one else is going on and on and on about this topic. Enough already. The decision has been made to discontinue the popups after the current volume of videos has been released. Additional complaints from people who have already voiced their opinion take away from the main focus we should have here. Let it go please. Ron Ninon 
Your vendetta continues? First, Dr. Greger invited commentary. Until he himself posts a comment on this and his intentions, and his requests to stop commenting on it, then everyone, including me, has a right to comment on it. You have tried to intimidate me before (to see guidelines etc etc), and you continue to do so. You criticise me ALONE. I am NOT the only one who has criticized the format – and several others have repeated their sentiments across multiple posts on the topic but you do not slap them! This is social media and heavy-handed tactics by admin, although typical of facebook, should not be here. This is a more “professional” forum, at least I had thought. To that extent, your threats are unwelcome: you are targetting me and only me. I repeat, this is unfair! Your support of others who may disagree with me with your “votes up” of them belies a pack mentality – a popularity contest. This forum should not support such bias! I have made detailed and informed copmments. I work in the area of attention and perception…and distraction. Over 50% of drivers now text and drive – an epidemic of deadly distracted driving – many – half or more on this forum will do so while thinking they are just fine and so continue to do so. My point: I have knowledge on human attention. Nobody else has posted the reasons why they feel distracted by the videos. I have done so. If you don’t like my “info”, ignore it – it’s easy to do and easier than ignoring a pop-up! But to delete me or block me is a sad reflection of biased intolerance. I have done more for promoting Dr G’s videos than you will ever know or could ever comprehend. I am a supporter. I also use his info for personal health purposes. But I have a right to emphasize what (I think) needs emphasized (ie, no distractions, keep it professional, etc.). And we do NOT know what his new format, if it comes, will be. Will it also be controversial and problematic. Thus, repetition has value, provided it is not cut-and-paste, and my comments have not been repetitious in their content, if you bothered to read them carefully. I will continue to post if and when I feel it contributes. You must stop intimidating me. This is NF not FB. nc54 
But in this video the popup was not irrelevant. It gave an example of how to create food synergy. So you are wrong about this video. Ron Ninon 
“doing little other than…”. nc54, Fair comment, but…I still found it distracting as did some others who bothered to vote with a comment. Why do I need to watch a guy eating? Look, many will like it, many won’t. Would a vote help? The majority is not always correct! Guest 
Please stop the goofy dr greger popups….really distracts from the video content. I have enjoyed the videos and information for years, but really find the new popups jarring. Thea 
Guest: Have no fears. The large majority of the feedback for the popups has been negative. The NutritionFacts team listened to the feedback. The rest of the videos on this volume are already pre-recorded. But after that, the popups (whew!) will no longer be part of the video. 
What a coincidence…I just had blueberries and black beans for lunch! Don Bauer 
Any benefits to adding Maca powder to a smoothie? Vege-tater 
Every home I visit has rows and rows of supplements and vitamins lining their counters and cabinets, and of course they all eat the Standard American Diet, and know they are deficient, so think this is their saving grace! Heaven forbid a bit of real food sneaks into their diet, let alone a combination! It’s so scary what people consider food, and sadly, I was once one of them, so it’s really hard to shut my big mouth when I know what a HUGE difference it can make! WFPBRunner 
It’s sad right. They think it works. Wade Patton 
Okay, I lied. I cannot just quit the site because there are VERY few other sources I trust to keep abreast of new research and studies AND to do such in a non-commercial (i.e. believable) manner. 
I tried five times to listen to today’s “lecture”, but kept distracting myself. I hide the video behind other tabs now-of course I can still hear the “spots”. 
Now i have a solution. I’ll simply read transcripts. Thanks to those who transcribe. 
After seeing practically every single video Dr. G has made for NF.O and most of the other videos he has been in on Youtube, I don’t need any “extra” Dr. G in my videos. I liked the first 1,000 or 2,000 videos, but just can’t watch them any more. 
I hate that I cannot share the new videos. There are so many “nut jobs” out there selling ideas about foods and supplements and nutritional concepts that I fear Michael Greger would EASILY get lumped into that category if I shared the greenscreened videos. I had some hopes that I could help a few folks, friends, family, and others find a better way to eat, and was persistently pestering my FBF’s with video links from here with my own commentary, also some comments from here were shared in my short tenure as a WFPB eater. 
I’ll just cut and paste transcripts. I don’t want anyone thinking I’m “following a nut job”, rather that Dr. G is a real MD with real information that can REALLY help nearly everyone. I understand that many folks enjoy the cutesiness and such, but it cheapens the whole experience for me. I’m not a fan of gimmickery and distractions. As you were. Thea 
Wade Patton: I hear you. The NutritionFacts team heard you too. The rest of the videos in this volume are pre-recorded and already have the popups. That will not change. However, after that, the new videos will not have the popups. Thank you for your patience. Wade Patton 
Thanks for letting me/us know. I had no idea how many vids he made per session. Endeavor to persevere I might. WFPBRunner 
Wade you quit? Dang I wasn’t aware. So yes Dr. Greger got the message but as you know they are made ahead of time. So be patient! I actually like reading the transcripts. Ron Ninon",1
Parkinson’s Disease and the Uric Acid Sweet Spot,"Parkinson’s Disease and the Uric Acid Sweet Spot VN:F [1.9.22_1171] 
The link between Parkinson’s and dairy may not just be explained by the pesticides and lactose. Close Transcript Transcript: Parkinson’s Disease and the Uric Acid Sweet Spot 
Below is an approximation of this video’s audio content. To see any graphs, charts, graphics, images, and quotes to which Dr. Greger may be referring, watch the above video. 
Parkinson’s disease is the second most common neurodegenerative disorder after Alzheimer’s. Characterized by a slowness of movement, rigidity, tremor, and stooping posture that all gets worse and worse—and, there’s also non-movement symptoms, like cognitive impairment, sleep, smell, and mood disturbances, as the disease spreads to other areas of the brain. 
The cause of Parkinson’s is perhaps one of the most important questions posed by the science of aging. For example, why is the consumption of dairy products associated with increased risk for Parkinson’s? Maybe, because they contribute to “our exposure to pesticides and other neurotoxins,” like dieldrin, which continues to be found in the autopsied brains of Parkinson’s victims—even though it was banned decades ago. But, it lingers in the environment, and we continue to be exposed to the pesticide through contaminated dairy, and other animal products. 
It’s “unlikely to be due to milk compounds such as calcium,…D,…fat, or…protein,” since there’s no association with Parkinson’s when they’re “derived from other sources.” It could be the milk sugar, though (lactose), accounting for the increased risk of death and bone fractures, as well as Parkinson’s, and earlier onset Huntington’s disease. 
But, there’s a third possibility, as well. Milk lowers uric acid levels, and uric acid may be protective against Huntington’s, and also slow the decline of Parkinson’s—and, most importantly, may lower the risk of getting Parkinson’s in the first place, thought to be because uric acid is an important antioxidant in the brain, something we’ve known for over thirty years now. 
This can be shown directly in human nerve cells in a petri dish. Add the pesticide rotenone, and oxidative stress shoots up. Add the pro-oxidant homocysteine, and it goes up even more. But, add some uric acid, and it completely suppresses the oxidative stress caused by the pesticide. 
But, drinking milk has a uric acid-lowering effect, citing this study, describing it as “[A] cute effect of milk.” But it turned out to be just a cute typo. An “Acute effect of milk on uric acid levels” in the blood. Drink cow’s milk, and uric acid levels drop 10% within hours. Drink soy milk, and they go up 10% within hours. Now, for the painful arthritic disease, gout, which is caused by too much uric acid, the uric acid-lowering effect of dairy is a good thing. 
But, uric acid is a double-edged sword. If our uric acid levels are too high, we can get gout. But, if they’re too low, it may increase our risk of neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer’s, Huntington’s, Parkinson’s, and MS. Here’s the five-year risk of gout in men for various uric acid levels. If our uric acid is over 10, we have a 30% chance of suffering an attack of gout within the next five years, whereas at levels under 7, our risk is less than 1%. 
So, it might make sense to have levels as high as possible, without going over 7, to protect the brain, without risking our joints. But, having excessive uric acid in the blood puts more than just our joints in jeopardy. Yes, having too low levels may increase our risk of MS, Parkinson’s, Alzheimer’s, and even cancer—but, having too high levels may increase our risk of gout, kidney, and heart disease. 
So, having a uric acid level over 7 isn’t just associated with an increased risk of gout, but an increased risk of dying from all causes. But, having a low uric acid level may also shorten our lifespan by increasing mortality. High uric acid is associated with increased risk of death from heart disease, but low uric acid is associated with increased risk of fatal stroke, for example. So, keeping uric acid at optimum levels—the sweet spot between 5 and 7—may protect the brain in more ways than one. 
If you measure the uric acid levels in those with Parkinson’s, they come in down around here, which can explain why dairy consumption may increase risk for Parkinson’s, because milk pushes uric acid levels down. Dairy may also explain the differences in uric acid levels between meat-eaters, vegetarians, and vegans. If you plot men out, vegans are significantly higher than vegetarians—presumably because they don’t drink milk, with those eating meat and milk somewhere in between.

I have an uncle with Parkinson’s and diabetes. It is a terribly debilitating disease. It is very frustrating for him. He is there, but has been slowly loosing his ability to communicate coherently. It is difficult to see this once witty, cosmopolitan and articulate man become a prisoner within his own body. The last time I saw him he offered me ice cream. There were several gallons of the stuff in their freezer, and he scooped out a large bowl with several different varieties for himself. My aunt told me that is all he wants to eat now a days. I declined telling him I no longer eat animal products. I told him that he would do well to adopt the same eating pattern. One of my cousins told me don’t bother because he has one foot in the grave and the other on a banana peel, and that it would be a shame to deprive him of one of his last pleasures. It is very sad. WFPBRunner 
I’ve been there. I had a patient who weighed 250 and Parkinson’s. I explained to the family that if he lost weight he would get around a lot better. They said the same thing. We feel so bad for him that we give him treats. After busting them many times they finally got the message. He got down to 160 and his medication was decreased. He was able to get around much better-even able to take long walks without assistant. Food and our attachments are a funny thing. Thea 
Joe Caner: I’m sorry to hear about your uncle. It can be so heart breaking to see loved ones making these types of decisions. My heart goes out to you. Blair Rollin 
I think , when they get to that point, they’re not really enjoying life anyway. Food consumption is the last bit of control they have in their lives. Eating fat and refined sugar is probably one of the few happinesses that they can even experience. My friend eats, and always has, a diet of mostly processed meats and dairy. “Very few vegetables.” He went on bp meds when he was 40, suffers debilitating gout and is in terrible health. When I suggest to him that his health problems are due to his diet and he should switch to a vegan diet his response is, “You have to die, right?”. I think this is a common attitude. Most of the diet related health problems manifest gradually and are confused with normal aging. They suffer from health hopelessness and can’t even remember what it was like to be healthy. Rachel 
To Joe and everyone who responded to Joe: I, too, have watched loved ones succumb to the chronic diseases of our times and die slow painful deaths. It is painful for us, the living, as well. And hopeless feeling. But this is also why those of us on this site need to stay the course and show others that the fates of our loved ones do not have to be our fate too. I hold my good health (63, BMI 21, no meds, no diseases, no doctors necessary) out as an example of what we CAN have as we age if we so choose. I try not to miss an opportunity to tell people, when they ask me about my WFPB diet, about the diabetes, blindness, cancer in my family and how my lack of those diseases in myself is no mistake. Every day I get to be an example to my community of the good health anyone can also have. But this topic intersects with another larger topic and that is ObamaCare. We are all paying gigantic insurance premiums – including myself – to pay for the ill health of those we love and are ill. The meat and dairy industry continues to cost us all. So I try to not miss an opportunity to delicately remind the curious of that fact – especially those who complain about the high cost of insurance. Because it isn’t the high cost of insurance that is the problem. It is the high cost of medical treatment for a very sick society. It took many years to get the word out about the cigarette industry. It will take decades on this topic as well. But each day we can all take great pride in honoring our loved ones by standing – and eating – for good health in their names and memories. That is the only way that I can deal with the pain of missing those I still love so much. Thea

How do i raise uric acid, i’m vegan and i have it in 3,77 mg/dl. I suppose i need to increase the protein intake by consuming more beans? lemonhead

I eat at least 5 pieces of fruit a day. Very complex science nutrition. I,m 35 may be you get more uric acid as you get old, so my levels are normal. https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12242321 Don Forrester MD-NF Moderator 
I wouldn’t go out of my way to increase uric acid levels. Lifestyle practices associated with elevated uric acid levels (e.g. alcohol, increased body fat, meat, fish, shellfish, low fiber, low folate, low physical activity) are on balance more harmful. There is no association of increased uric acid with consumption of animal or plant protein or purine rich vegetables (e.g. asparagus, cauliflower, peas). Keep up with NF.org as the science keeps coming! Have a happy holiday season. HaltheVegan 
In the graph shown in the video, it looks like soy milk raises uric acid levels at least for a few hours after drinking it. If one has slightly low uric acid (4.5 mg/dl), would it be advisable to drink some soy milk to raise it to the 5 to 7 mg/dl range suggested in the video? (PS, I’m WFPB and do moderate exercise. ) David J 
Coffee and supplemental C lower uric acid, so you might want to avoid those. susan 
Very interesting video. I went searching for info about the connection between heart disease and uric acid levels. http://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/472684_3 According to this link women are at mant times greater risk of death due to ischemic heart disease when uric acid levels rise above 7.0 … 300% greater risk for women (!!!) vs 77% for men. How is it that this is not even mentioned by doctors? even when I suffered gout one summer, the doctor laughed and said I was hardly henry the Vlll type being fit and slim, and said, ‘next time, dont suffer, come in and get meds’ 
My question is, is the connection to heart, kidney, and other diseases in fact weak, and if not why are doctors not mentioning this as a matter of course to patients? George 
It’s impossible to have percentages over 100% because then everyone would have it! Basic level statistics susan 
hi George, thanks, I just took it from the medscape page.. so it could be written, 0.77 vs 3.0 ? anyway the fact remains that women are at high risk of cvd with elevated uric acid levels independent of other factors. And, I wonder if family members suffering gout increases risk ? I have to look into this more John 
George, it’s about risk. If one way you had 10% risk, then you changed something and now your risk is 30%, you had 300% of the risk you had before. John S susan 
yes, thank you John for your comments. I find this and related topics so interesting. I have been viewing the other videos linked under Doctors notes having to do with uric acid levels, diet as in cause and treatment etc. Dr Forrester posted some causes of elevated uric acid levels above, but in my case (I dont drink etc) they say my one gout attack could be dehydration related since I joined the running club that year. In any event, once was enough! Here today reading about parkinson’s and other devestating diseases, I have to agree with Rachel that in going forward the thing to do is stay informed and be the best example we can be. John 
They probably don’t know. The majority of their continuing education is paid for by Big Pharma. WHy would Big Pharma care about that? John S 
Hello, so would ghee (clarified butter) have any effect on uric acid? George 
M. D.: The only dairy product I consume is 1 tsp of ghee a day, which is the only thing that keeps me from having to deal with dry eyes, so i’m interested in your question. Please read under the possible mechanisms in the following article; https://www.dairynutrition.ca/index.php/scientific-evidence/roles-on-certain-health-conditions/milk-products-and-gout Ghee is all lipids and based on the information given they don’t seem to have anything to do with the effect of dairy on serum uric acid levels. But this site promotes dairy products, so without reading the papers, we shouldn’t come to conclusions. susan 
This link may offer some ideas MD, if you scroll down and look undet Appendix 1 , dietary advice for gout patients. They advise fresh fruits and vegetables, daals, and similar dishes are good. Fat laden ‘party foods’ are to be avoided. http://doctor.ndtv.com/topicdetails/ndtv/tid/60/Gout_and_high_blood_uric_acid_levels_(hyperuricaemia) .html Skeptic Steve Billig 
Many (most?) metabolic activities in the body fall into the “Goldilocks” category of those with a sweet spot (range actually) above which and below which are unhealthful [body temperature, respiration, blood pressure, blood pH, many minerals (iron), many vitamins (A), dietary protein, calories and on and on]. Happily, a well designed vegan diet often is helpful in keeping the body in the healthy range. I hope there is a follow-up to this video that describes the food and food group strategies that help keep uric acid levels in the healthy range, and vegetarian dietary patterns that push the body out of the healthy uric acid range. broccolu 
Sometimes it is hard to differentiate when it is sciences and when it is the anti meat anti dairy stance from the good doctor. 
First of all, pesticides are everywhere, in plant foods and animal foods. If you eat GMO plant foods and don’t wash them thoroughly then you will eat a load of pesticides. 
Secondly, about the uric acid, I look at all the research articles and they said that low uric acid is associated with Parkinson’s disease. Nowhere does it say about dairy products. So a lot of people have low uric acid for a number of reasons. For instance eating cherry will lower your uric acid too. Should we stop eating cherry because of this? Does Dr Greger talk about not eating cherry to avoid Parkinson’s? 
At the Parkinson’s web site, they talk about taking inosine supplement to raise the uric acid level which can be low in some people due to a number of reasons (not because of milk or cherry, LOL).",1
Wakame Seaweed Salad May Lower Blood Pressure,"Wakame Seaweed Salad May Lower Blood Pressure VN:F [1.9.22_1171] Close   Wakame Seaweed Salad May Lower Blood Pressure 
  
I used to think of seaweed as just a beneficial whole food source of minerals—like iodine, for which it is the most concentrated dietary source. And, indeed, just a half-teaspoon of mild seaweeds, like arame or dulse, or two sheets of nori a day, should net you all the iodine you need for the day. 
But, “the intake of seaweeds is advised” not only as a whole food source of iodine, but also, evidently, “for the prevention of lifestyle-related chronic diseases.” Based on what? 
Well, you’ll see this kind of reasoning; the Japanese live long, and they eat seaweed. And so, they speculate that seaweed might have something to do with it, based on suggestive reports. But, when you see lists, like this, of all the supposed biological activities some food has, you want to know is this based on clinical data (meaning on actual people) or so-called preclinical data (based on test tubes and lab animals)? When a study like this is published, talking about the “Effects of seaweed-reconstructed pork diets” on rats, what do you do with that information? Seaweed is one of the ingredients they’re trying to use to improve the “image” of meat products. So, they try to add grape seeds, or flax seeds, or walnuts, or purple rice or, whatever this is. I had to look it up: thong-weed. How’s that for an image booster? 
You can look at epidemiological studies (meaning looking at populations). And, indeed, Japanese preschoolers who eat seaweed tend to have lower blood pressures, suggesting seaweed might have beneficial effects—which would make sense, given all the minerals and fiber. But, you can’t prove cause and effect with that kind of study. Maybe it was the other components of the diet that went along with the seaweed-eating. 
It’s even harder to do these kinds of studies on adults; so many people are on high blood pressure medications. University of Tokyo researchers took an innovative approach by comparing the diets of people on low-dose, versus high-dose, versus multiple blood pressure medications. And, although they all had artificially normalized blood pressure, those that ate the most fruit and sea vegetables tended to be the ones on the lower doses—supporting a dietary role for seaweed. But, why not just put it to the test? 
A double-blind crossover trial found that seaweed fiber lowered blood pressure, apparently by pulling sodium out of the system. I know they couldn’t use real seaweed, because then you couldn’t fool people with a placebo; but, why not just, like, put whole powdered seaweed in pills? This was finally attempted, ten years later. 
Compared to doing nothing, they got beautiful drops in blood pressure. But, if you look deeper into the study, they desalinized the seaweed—meaning they took out two-thirds of the sodium naturally found in it. So, that still doesn’t tell us if eating seaweed salad is actually going to help with blood pressure. What we need is a randomized controlled trial with just plain, straight seaweed. But, no one had ever done that study—until this study out of Ecuador. 
Six grams of wakame, natural sodium and all, led to a significant drop in blood pressure, especially in those who started out high. Side effects were all minor, and what one might expect increasing fiber intake. And, the nice thing about whole food, plant-based interventions is you sometimes get good side effects as well, such as the resolution of gastritis—stomach inflammation that they’d been having—as well as the disappearance of chronic headaches.

I’ve read that only asians, for the most part, have the bacteria (macrobiome) to properly digest seaweed. And by properly digest I mean….”to properly breakdown the seaweed to allow usability of the nutrients and such in seaweed.” 
Some sort of genetic trait asians have? Evolutionary? 
Truth in this? Joe Caner 
It would seem that gut flora has more to do with what one eats as opposed to genetic factors. Asian populations are better able to handle seaweed in their diets precisely because they eat more seaweed so their gut flora adapts accordingly: 
“Recent studies analyzed the gut flora of people across multiple countries and continents and identified two enterotypes. Enterotypes correlate with our diet and can change as our diet changes. Diets rich in animal protein and saturated fat are associated with the Bacteriodes enterotype, while diets rich in healthy carbohydrates are associated with the Prevotella enterotype.” http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/microbiome/ Roxy 
So did the Okinawans have both of these types of enterotypes? How about some of the other cultures (longest lived) that include animal products/fish in their diet? Do they also have a healthy, varied enter type that of both baceriodes and prevotella? Roxy 
And, apparently, the seaweed/gut bacteria macrobiome evolved over thousands and thousands of years, unlike, I think, the enteretype issue you are referencing that has more to do with our gut bacteria changing quickly, daily, weekly, due to the diet. Apparently seaweed might be a different issue, and for whatever reason takes a culture thousands of years to adjust. Richard W 
Perhaps it is beneficial but, like fish oil, seaweed probably comes with a dose of pollutants too. Roxy 
I am curious about all the plastic-residue showing up in fish….and if seaweed would then accumulate these plastics-chemical residues. Ishay 
Unfortunately, most natural food will contain at least trace levels of pollutants, even those grown organically in ‘natural’ soil. It doesn’t mean, however, that this is always a palpable cause for concern. Theoretically, even though all seas and oceans are polluted to a degree, sea vegetables are low in the food chain, so there is less bio-accumulation of most contaminants. 
The biggest concern in seaweed is inorganic arsenic. Hijiki is known to have high, potentially harmful levels, but moderate consumption of most other sea vegetables, including wakame, shouldn’t pose a significant risk: 
I don’t know if seaweed that’s grown in indoor tanks is commercially available (similar to microalgae used for DHA/EPA pills), but that might become a safer alternative one day. Wade Patton 
I shared the transcript. nonyabizzz 
ok, but the seaweed salad shown obviously has a sizable amount of oil on it, possibly counteracting some of the health benefits… 
The frame rate seems off in this video? rjs 
  small study that hasn’t been replicated (with seaweed that hasn’t been desalinized). Given the high sodium content of commercially available seaweed, I still feel reluctant to try it. 
I’m already doing as many lifestyle things as I can to lower my BP such as eating a whole plant vegan diet, restricting sodium, drinking hibiscus tea, consuming fax seeds daily, avoiding BPA, doing daily aerobic exercise, and exercising with hand grips. Anyone have any other ideas? Matthew Smith 
Hello! You are doing everything exactly right. Dr. Greger suggests “beans, whole grains, other legumes, beets, beet juice, cocoa, flaxseeds, greens, hibiscus tea, purple potatoes, and the seaweed, wakame,” in his hypertension page. Have you tried Vitamin D and Magnesium (watch out for diarrhea)? How long have you been on a low sodium diet? Since they add Iodine to salt, I have avoided it, and I developed in my opinion low Iodine levels. I had just one half teaspoon of salt and could no longer feel my heartbeat in my chest. I have since fallen in love with some salt. It takes at least a gram of salt a day to be healthy. I love Iodine. Dr. Greger recommends it. Beware of its heart benefits. Doctors say it is ideal to not be able to feel your heartbeat. Perhaps it is Iodine that modulates this. Darryl 
Potassium Blood pressure response to changes in sodium and potassium intake: a metaregression analysis of randomised trials 
Sodium reduction (median: -1.7 g/d) was associated with a change of -2.54 mmHg in systolic blood pressure…Corresponding values for increased potassium intake (median: +1.7 g/d) was -2.42 mmHg 
In the context of a WFPB diet, increasing potassium means favoring tubers and beans over cereal grains as staple calories, more greens & tomatoes, and using “lite-salt” (50/50 mix KCl & NaCl) where possible. I mail-order sun-dried tomatoes (the most concentrated potassium source) in bulk, and they’re my main “dried fruit”. Previous Video",1
Who Shouldn't Eat Soy? | NutritionFacts.org,"Close Transcript Transcript: Who Shouldn’t Eat Soy? 
Below is an approximation of this video’s audio content. To see any graphs, charts, graphics, images, and quotes to which Dr. Greger may be referring, watch the above video. 
When the Women’s Health Initiative study found that menopausal women taking hormone replacement therapy suffered “higher rates of breast cancer, cardiovascular disease, and overall harm,” a call was made for safer alternatives. Yes, estrogen has positive effects, the Women’s Health Initiative found—such as reducing menopausal symptoms and improving bone health, reducing hip fracture risk; but also negative effects—increasing risk of blood clots in the heart, brain, and lungs, as well as breast cancer. 
So, ideally, to get the best of both worlds, we’d need what’s called a selective estrogen receptor modulator, something that has pro-estrogenic effects in some tissues (like bone), but anti-estrogenic effects in other tissues (like the breast). Drug companies are trying to make them, but phytoestrogens—natural compounds in plants, like genistein in soybeans, that are structurally similar to estrogen—appear to function as natural selective estrogen receptor modulators. How could something that looks like estrogen act as an anti-estrogen? 
The original theory for how soy phytoestrogens control breast cancer growth is that they compete with our own estrogens for binding to the estrogen receptor. As you drip more and more soy compounds on breast cancer cells in a petri dish, less and less actual estrogen is able to bind to them. So, the estrogen-blocking ability of phytoestrogens can help explain their anti -estrogenic effects. But, how do we then explain their pro -estrogenic effects on other tissues, like bone? How can soy have it both ways? 
The mystery was solved when we discovered there are two types of estrogen receptors in the body. And, so, how a target cell responds depends on which type of estrogen receptors they have. This may be “the key to understanding the health-protective potential of soy phytoestrogens”—the existence of this newly discovered estrogen receptor, named estrogen receptor beta, to distinguish it from the classic estrogen receptor alpha. And, unlike our body’s own estrogen, soy phytoestrogens preferentially bind to the beta receptors. 
If you have people eat about a cup of cooked whole soybeans, within about eight hours, genistein levels in the blood reach about 20 to 50 nanomoles—that’s how much is circulating throughout our body, bathing our cells. About half is bound up to proteins in the blood; so, the effective concentration is about half that. So, let’s see what that means for estrogen receptor activation. 
This is the graph that explains the mysterious health benefits of soy foods. Down around the effective levels you’d get eating a cup of soybeans, there’s very little alpha activation—but, lots of beta activation. So, now let’s look at where each of these receptors are located in the human body. 
The way estrogen pills increase the risk of fatal blood clots is by causing the liver to dump out all these extra clotting factors. But, guess what? The human liver only contains alpha estrogen receptors, not beta receptors. And so, maybe, if we ate like 30 cups of soybeans a day, that could be a problem. But, at the kinds of concentrations one would get with just normal soy consumption, no wonder this is a problem with drug estrogens—but not soy phytoestrogens. 
The effects on the uterus appear also to be mediated solely by alpha receptors—which is, presumably, why no negative impact has been seen with soy. So, while estrogen-containing drugs may increase the risk of endometrial cancer up to ten-fold, phytoestrogen-containing foods are associated with significantly less endometrial cancer—in fact, protective effects for these types of gynecological cancers, in general. Women who ate the most soy had 30% less endometrial cancer, and appeared to cut their ovarian cancer risk nearly in half. 
Soy phytoestrogens don’t appear to have any effect on the lining of the uterus, but still can dramatically improve menopausal symptoms. The Kupperman index is like a compilation of all 11 of the most common menopausal symptoms. 
In terms of bone health, human bone cells carry beta estrogen receptors. So, we might expect soy phytoestrogens to be protective. And, indeed, they do seem to significantly increase bone mineral density—consistent with population data suggesting “High consumption of soy products is associated with increased bone mass.” But, can they prevent bone loss over time? 
Soy milk was compared to a transdermal progesterone cream. The control group lost significant bone mineral density in their spine over the two-year study period. But, the progesterone group lost significantly less, and the two glasses of soy milk a day group ended up actually better than when they started. This is probably the most robust study to date, comparing the soy phytoestrogen genistein to a more traditional hormone replacement drug regimen. In the spine, over a year, the placebo group lost bone density, but gained in the phytoestrogen and estrogen groups, and the same with the hip bones. 
The study clearly shows that the soy phytoestrogen prevents bone loss, and enhances new bone formation, in turn producing a net gain of bone mass. But, the only reason we care about bone mass is that we want to prevent fractures. Is soy food consumption associated with lower fracture risk? Yes. A significantly lower risk of bone fracture associated with just a single serving of soy a day—the equivalent of 5 to 7 grams of soy protein, or 20 to 30 milligrams of phytoestrogens. So, that’s just like one cup of soy milk—or, even better, a serving of a whole soy food, like tempeh or edamame, or the beans themselves. 
We don’t have fracture data on soy supplements, though. So, if we seek the types of health benefits we presume Asian populations get from eating whole and traditional soy foods, maybe we should look to eating those, rather than taking unproven protein powders or pills. 
Is there anyone who should avoid soy? Well, some people have soy allergies. A national survey found that only about 1 in 2,000 people report a soy allergy. That’s 40 times less than the most common allergen—dairy milk—and about ten times less than all the other common allergens—like fish, eggs, shellfish, nuts, wheat, or peanuts.

JUST IN: Trump Camp Caught On Cam Bragging Of “Voter Suppression” Against Women & Blacks (VIDEO),"Comments 
Consultant Jesse Benton of the pro-Trump Great America Super PAC was just caught on camera admitting that he and his associates have been conducting a voter suppression campaign targeting African-Americans and women. 
“In Cleveland, if we can return Hillary to normal turnout levels … we can turn her to regular turnout levels she’s gonna lose about 60,000 votes in that area – that’s dead heat. So we have a voter suppression campaign quite frankly, targeting African-Americans, and sort of suburban moms, just bad stuff about Hillary, just trying to take their taste for her away.” 
Benton is the same Trump operative who was convicted of purchasing the vote of an Iowa state Senator and was recently busted attempting to funnel $2 million in illegal donations from a Chinese donor who turned out to be an undercover Telegraph reporter. 
The Donald Trump campaign has been accusing anybody who dares to speak against them – the Clinton campaign, the media, polling organizations – of “rigging” the election against them. But time and time again it’s been obvious that the Republican Party has been the one behind the scenes working to disenfranchis e the American voter – especially non-white, male voters . 
Since the Republicans can’t win this game, they have elected to change the rules instead, by passing restrictive voter ID laws that disenfranchise a large number of voters – especially minorities – from exercising their right to vote, closing down polling stations. 
They justify this in an underhanded appeal to “protecting the integrity” of our democracy by waving the imaginary specter of “voter fraud” over the nation’s head. This is an entirely manufactured crisis that does not exist, but has been used to deprive thousands of potential Democratic voters of their rights. The Republican Party is an enemy of American democracy, and we must punish them for it at the ballot box.

"The Libertarian Party Just Gave Up On Winning, Tacitly Endorsed Hillary Over Trump","Comments 
The Libertarian vice-presidential nominee, Bill Weld, has accepted that his ticket’s longshot bid for the presidency is doomed, and indirectly demanded that voters give their votes to Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton instead. He will remain on the ticket but will solely work towards stopping Trump for the remainder of the election cycle. 
The Libertarian ticket, usually popular with a small margin of voters with a particularly poor understanding of basic economics and the Constitution, were looking like they were going to put up a surprisingly strong performance as Republican nominee Donald Trump dragged the GOP brand into the mud, until a series of inexcusable gaffes by presidential nominee Gary Johnson destroyed what little credibility they had. 
In a statement today, Weld roundly tore into Trump for his unfitness to command and his moral deficiencies . 
“I would like to address myself to all those in the electorate who remain torn between two so-called major party candidates whom they cannot enthusiastically support. I’m speaking particularly to those Republicans who feel that our President should exhibit commonly accepted standards of decency and discipline. 
Mr. Trump has some charisma and panache, and intellectual quickness. These qualities can be entertaining. Yet more than charisma, more even than intellectual ability, is required of a serious candidate for this country’s highest office. A serious candidate for the Presidency of the United States must be stable, and Donald Trump is not stable. 
“Throughout this campaign, Mr. Trump has demonstrated an inability to handle criticism or blame well. His first instinct is to lash out at others. When challenged, he often responds as a child might. He makes a sour face, he calls people by insulting names, he waves his arms, he impatiently interrupts. Most families would not allow their children to remain at the dinner table if they behaved as Mr. Trump does. He has not exhibited the self-control, the discipline, or the emotional depth necessary to function credibly as a President of the United States. 
“From the beginning of his campaign, Mr. Trump has conjured up enemies. First it was eleven million criminals in our midst, all bent on obtaining the benefits of citizenship, at our expense. Over time, the enemies became any trading partner of the United States. He says they are nothing but foreigners seeking to threaten our livelihoods. Now we have reached the point where his idea of America’s enemies includes almost anyone who talks or looks different from him. The goal of the Trump campaign, from the outset, has been to stir up envy, resentment, and group hatred. 
This is the worst of American politics. I fear for our cohesion as a nation, and for our place in the world, if this man who is unwilling to say he will abide by the result of our national election becomes our President. This is not the time to cast a jocular or feel-good vote for a man whom you may have briefly found entertaining. Donald Trump should not, cannot, and must not be elected President of the United States.” He’s absolutely right. While the inclusion of more political parties into our stagnant two-party system can only be healthy for our democracy, unfortunately this is not the right moment. Donald Trump is a clear and present danger to our nation as we know it, and stopping him must be our number one priority. This is not the time to throw away a vote on the Libertarian Party.",1

Obama Just Ordered The Pentagon To Stop Making Vets Repay Bonuses,"Comments 
The Obama administration has ordered the Pentagon to immediately cease demanding the repayment of enlistment bonuse s from some 10,000 National Guardsmen who served in Iraq and Afghanistan. The Defense Finance and Accounting Service argued that the soldiers were not qualified to receive the money or that accounting errors had resulted in improper payments, despite many of them having served multiple tours. 
Soldiers from California have been badgering their Congressional representatives about this issue for two years , but Congress has done nothing to alleviate the Pentagon’s demands that soldiers repay money they were given years ago and have certainly earned by putting their lives and limbs on the line serving American interests abroad. Some $70 million was spent by overzealous recruiters looking to fill their quotas that the Pentagon is now looking to get back. 
“While some soldiers knew or should have known they were ineligible for benefits they were claiming, many others did not. About 2,000 have been asked, in keeping with the law, to repay erroneous payments. We’re not going to nickel-and-dime them when they get back, and we’re not going to hold service members responsible unfairly for unethical conduct or fraud perpetrated by someone else” said Secretary of Defense Ash Carter. The Obama Administration is now looking to “fast-track” the investigations, which have been dragging on for years. 
However, the Obama administration is still not bowing to bipartisan pressure from Congress to fully forgive the money. 
In a statement, Paul Rieckhoff, founder and CEO of Iraq and Afghanistan Veterans of America, applauded the move but says more still needs to be done. 
“This is a good step from the Pentagon. But it is long overdue and far from enough. Thousands of lives have been turned upside down and veterans who have served honorably are now in financial ruin through no fault of their own. While it’s good for them to know recouping has been halted, that does not make them financially whole or address their urgent needs. Many will be stuck waiting for clarity and the results of the investigation until next year. The Pentagon needs to do more than just halt the recouping, it needs to pay them back–with interest.” 
The war against Daesh (ISIS/ISIL) is costing the American taxpayer about $11 million a day . The United States military budget is around $600 billion a year , and the Pentagon has “lost track” of some $8 trillion over the past few decades . We can definitely afford to forgive a measly $70 million in order to ensure the financial security of the brave men and women defend our country and our national interests overseas. To hear the Pentagon cry poverty and try to squeeze money out of our National Guardsmen and women after wasting billions of dollars on projects like the defective F-35 joint-strike fighter jet is appalling.",1

But we went to union halls and guys that I grew up with — people who normally vote Democrat who are thinking of voting for Trump. That is a huge chunk of the population, especially where I’m from. So I wasn’t there so much to convert them away. I don’t think a lot of them necessarily decided for sure that they were going to vote for him. But I want them to think about the damage they could do by being a legal terrorist on November 8th. 
That didn’t stop Milo from broadcasting this video containing a clip from Moore’s movie which has gotten over 6 million views, but without publishing the entire narrative which explained how a vote for Trump might feel good in the short term like Brexiteers imagined their votes might feel this past summer. Moore’s point is that Trump’s populist rhetoric sounds good, but his economic ideas and 19th century tariffs would be terribly damaging to American business, and ultimately to workers. 
If you keep watching the movie immediately after the part that Milo cited, then you would actually hear this dire warning by Michael Moore about the abject danger of electing the Republican candidate who’d like to end the First Amendment, destroy America’s economy and bring Jim Crow out of the dark past of the deep south and parade him around the entire United States. This is how Moore described the severe buyer’s remorse felt by Brexit voters: 
[Voting for Trump will feel good] for a day. Maybe a week. Possibly a month. And then. Like the Brits, who wanted to send a message, so they voted to leave Europe only to find out that if you vote to leave Europe you, actually have to leave Europe. And now they regret it. All the Ohioans, Pennsylvanians, Michiganders and Wisconsinites of Middle England, right, they all voted to leave and now they regret it. 
And over 4 million of them signed a petition to have a do-over, they want another election, but It’s not going to happen. Because you used the ballot as an anger management tool. And now you’re fucked. And the rest of Europe. They’re like, Bye Felicia. So when the rightfully angry people of Ohio and Michigan and Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin find out after a few months in office that President Trump wasn’t going to do a damn thing for them, it will be too late to do anything about it. 
But I get it. You wanted to send a message. You had righteous anger. And justifiable anger. Well, message sent. Goodnight America. You’ve just elected the last president of the United States. 
Once again a simple fact check shows that a widely conservative writer is lying to his audience by taking video out of context to make an argument that is entirely divorced from the actual facts. Michael Moore would never endorse a candidate like Donald Trump or his Republican friends that share his values and lie to America’s working people about their multi-decade campaign to deliver more money to the top 1% of American households at the expense of 99% of our country’s population.",1
Will Ferrell Just Came Back As Bush To Destroy Trump (VIDEO),"Comments 
Famed actor and funnyman Will Ferrell returned to Comedy Central to reprise his caricature of despised President George W. Bush to hilarious effect. 
“First of all, I’d like to say something about my cousin Billy Bush. He’s been in the news a lot lately. Him and that disgraced pumpkin, Donald Trump, talking on the bus. I just want to say ONE thing, we Bushes don’t act like that, okay? We have standards, and we’re raised certain way. We would never, under any circumstances, ride a bus. When you’re a Bush, you ride in a limousine or a jump jet, or maybe a monster truck called Sasquatch Express. Never a bus.” 
Ferrell then goes on point out that somehow, the utterly abhorrent character of Republican   has whitewashed Bush’s less viscerally appalling but equally reprehensible legacy. 
“This dunderhead is making me look great. I destabilized an entire region [Iraq], but no one seems to care anymore thanks to the Bozo Trump here. Folks forgotten how I tanked the economy or how I didn’t get Bin Laden.” 
Nobody should forget how the Great Recession was engineered and executed under the watch of George W. Bush or how the wars he began mortgaged our nation’s future and led to the deaths of millions around the world. One shudders to think of what a President Trump would do to this country and the safety of the free world.

A Tea Party Congressman Just Called For Armed Uprising If Trump Loses,"Former Tea Party congressman and conservative radio host Joe Walsh (R-IL) recently took to Twitter to announce his plans for armed insurrection against the government when Republican   loses the election in a few weeks. On November 8th, I’m voting for Trump. 
On November 9th, if Trump loses, I’m grabbing my musket.

This is not the first time the outspoken radical has made controversial remarks. He responded to the tragic shootings of police officers in Dallas by a lone wolf sniper by openly calling for a race war. Before that, Walsh called for the journalists at MSNBC and CNN to be beheaded for refusing to show the Charlie Hebdo cartoons that provided the justification for the terrorist attacks committed by a cell claiming allegiance to al-Qaeda in the Arab Peninsula (AQAP) against the publication’s offices in January 2015.

Trump Just Charged Poor Kids $20K To Use His Golf Course For Fundraiser He “Sponsored”,"Comments 
It’s an understatement to say that Republican nominee Donald Trump does not have a good record when it comes to charity and donating to good causes. But as the death knell sounds for his campaign, he still isn’t changing his miserly ways. New reports indicate that Trump graciously allowed the Palm Beach Boys & Girls Club to hold a fundraiser at the Trump International Golf Course in Florida – and then charged them $20,000 for the favor. 
“This ‘free’ event is costing us $20,000 between golf and catering fees. What we had hoped for as far as a ‘net’ income for this event has been cut in half (if we are lucky)” complained Mark Casale, vice president of philanthropy for the Boys and Girls Clubs. 
The course usually charges around $5,000 and leaves the county off the hook for the rest, but not this time. The annual charitable tournament goes to a different organization every year; it just so happens that this year’s choice was made by District 6 commissioner Melissa McKinlay – who is a Democrat. 
“None of this was disclosed to me when given the choice to select a charity. I was under the impression the charity was able to host the event without any charges. Explain to me how this is supposed to be a benefit to the county?” demanded McKinlay in an email. “If I were the Boys & Girls Club, I would pull out. How are smaller charities supposed to be able to afford this? This has placed me and the charity in a very bad position and I am quite upset by it.” 
Neither the Trump International Golf Course nor the Trump campaign have responded to requests for comment. 
Washington Post reporter David Farenthold has undertaken a minutely detailed investigation into Donald Trump’s charitable past – and found that he has donated far less than he claims to have give n. Most of the money Trump has “donated” was donated to the Trump Foundation by other donors; many charities – including those belonging to veterans’ organizations – were promised donations that were never paid out . It’s been discovered that the “Trump Foundation” was never properly certified to solicit donations in the first place, and Farenthold’s research shows that Trump has been using his “charitable foundation” to launder money through to evade millions in taxes. Trump would charge a starving person for the scraps from his table; he has not a charitable bone in his body. His selfishness is legendary, and we cannot elect such a morally deficient man to the Presidency.",1
Republicans Just Revealed They’re ALREADY Plotting “Years” Of Hillary Investigations,"Comments 
The House GOP are preparing for a Clinton presidency by doing absolutely nothing to change their plans, announcing the threat of continued investigations into soon-to-be President-elect Hillary Clinton, which they warn will go on for years. Rep. Jason Chaffetz (R-UT) is spearheading the charges against her, in spite of un-endorsing Trump just two weeks ago. 
“Even before we get to Day One, we’ve got two years’ worth of material already lined up. She has four years of history at the State Department, and it ain’t good,” he threatened. 
Although Clinton is predicted to win by a landslide majority, Republicans could retain control of the House due to conservative voting at the local level decades of extensive jerrymandering by Republican statehouses. This might make Clinton be the first president since George H.W. Bush to deal with a House Oversight Committee controlled by their opposing party in her first term. 
Of course, other Republicans agree with the efforts to take down Clinton, gleefully planning to exacerbate political divisions and distaste in this country and recreating the climate that led to Trump getting as far as he has. 
The office of House Speaker Paul D. Ryan (R-Wis.) issued a statement saying, “The rigorous oversight conducted by House Republicans has already brought to light troubling developments in the [Hillary] Clinton email scandal. The speaker supports [Oversight’s] investigative efforts following where the evidence leads, especially where it shows the need for changes in the law.” 
The thought of Republicans wasting additional time and money on trying to take down Clinton is a spit in the face to her campaign. David Brock, leader of the American Bridge PAC, accusing Chaffetz of squandering taxpayer dollars on his nonsense investigation. “It’s clear Congressman Chaffetz is ready to spend resources on additional worthless political investigations that will, again, come up with nothing,” he commented. 
Rep. Elijah E. Cummings (D-Md.), a ranking member of the Oversight Committee and the Select Committee on Benghazi, echoed these sentiments, explaining, “Republicans are pretending like they haven’t been investigating Secretary Clinton for years ever since she announced that she was running for president, including everything from Benghazi to emails to the Clinton Foundation. It’s no exaggeration to say that on the first day Secretary Clinton walks into the White House, Republicans will have already investigated her more than any other president in history.” 
Chaffetz’s anticipated investigation may be reliant on stolen documents, sourced via WikiLeaks, though he claims he doesn’t “want to be dealing with that.” When asked if this will resemble Watergate, Chaffetz tries to warn that it could go that far depending on cooperation. 
The one thing Chaffetz hasn’t accounted for? A Trump presidency. “Heaven help us!” he says, laughing. “Please, no! I’m not even going to think about that one. I can’t even utter the sentence out loud.” 
In spite of Republicans voting Clinton on Election Day, they are still acting like whiny children, stopping at nothing to push their counter-intuitive political agenda on America. It is a prime example of Republican hypocrisy, and selfish refusal to let the country run optimally in favor of the agendas of their corporate masters and the monied elites.",1
The “Blacks For Trump” Man Once Belonged To A Murderous Cult,"Comments 
Republican nominee Donald Trump has been strategically placing certain people behind his him at rallies to create a false illusion about the diversity of his supporters. You may have noticed a man holding a “BLACKS FOR TRUMP” sign behind the racist rabble-rouser at his events, with a website URL “GODS2.com” underneath it. If you’ve wondered just what kind of black Americans could bring themselves to support Trump or if this election could get any weirder, well, hold on to your seat. 
The man holding the sign is “Michael the Black Man,” also known as Maurice Woodside or Michael Symonette. LittleGreenFootballs did some research and discovered that Michael isn’t your ordinary concerned citizen. He’s a former member of a murderous cult , Yahweh ben Yahweh, led by preacher Hulon Mitchell Jr. 
Michael, along with 15 other Yahweh followers, was charged for allegedly conspiring in two murders; his brother, who was also in the cult, told jurors that Michael had helped beat one man who was later killed and stuck a sharpened stick into another man’s eyeball. But jurors found Michael (and six other Yahweh followers) innocent. They sent Mitchell away for 20 years in the federal pen. 
Michael later reinvented himself as a radio host and an anti-gay, anti-Obama preacher and soon found himself in the spotlight at Republican events, whose organizers were delighted to have found another person of color to attack Obama without being obviously racist. His website, GODS2.com, is filled with the delusional, vaguely anti-Semitic rantings of a madman and homages to Yahweh. 
This may not mean much in the long run, but it’s worth pointing out just how outrageous the hypocrisy of the Trump campaign is. Trump attacked Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton when the father of the Orlando nightclub shooter appeared in the stands behind her at a rally out of chance, accusing her of associating with the father of a deranged murderer – but this man is actually being planted behind Trump because of his skin color.

Ana Navarro Destroys Adulterer Newt Gingrich for Saying Megyn Kelly Is “Fascinated With Sex” (VIDEO),"Comments 
Republican consultant Ana Navarro tore into Trump surrogate, former Speaker of the House, and unrepentant dirty old man Newt Gingrich during a segment tonight in CNN. The correspondent laid into Gingrich over his disgraceful behavior last night on the Kelly File , calling out the absurd hypocrisy of his attempts to defend Donald Trump’s admitted sexual assaults and accusing host Megyn Kelly of being “fascinated with sex.” 
“I think the word you were looking for was ‘hypocritical. Remember Newt Gingrich’s wife? When he was running in 2012, told all of us, told the media the media, said it to the camera. Newt Gingrich offered her the choice between an open marriage or a divorce. So maybe, just maybe, if all of that baggage is on your shoulders, maybe you shouldn’t be the surrogate out there wagging your finger and accusing the woman who was reporting on sexual assault — let me explain it slowly — sexual assault and sex are two things. One is unwanted. One is wanted. So maybe they need to understand that to begin with.” 
Newt Gingrich began having an affair while his wife Jackie Battley was battling cancer and told her he was divorcing her when she was still in the hospital. Gingrich’s campaign treasurer said that Newt told him dismissively that “She’s not young enough or pretty enough to be the wife of the President. And besides, she has cancer.” He then cheated on his second wife with another woman twentysome years his junior. It’s obvious why Gingrich is defending Trump: he’s from the same stock of ageing windbags who view women as objects to be used and discarded when they tire of them. 
For Gingrich to become so upset at Kelly for not immediately discarding the allegations of sexual assault facing Trump just shows how out of touch the Trump campaign truly is. Kelly, who has almost certainly weathered her fair share of sexual harassment and unwanted advances from the lecherous codgers at FOX , has good reason to believe these women, because she knows what kind of man Donald Trump is – the same kind of man that sexual predator Roger Ailes is; the same kind of man that rampant philander Newt Gingrich is; the kind of men who have run the Republican Party for decades. The party of “family values” indeed.

The Yale Review Did Not Endorse Hillary. The Reason Why Is Hilarious,"Posted on October 27, 2016 
The editorial board at the Yale Review gave the most curious non-endorsement of Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton this election season has yet seen – and with a lesson that most of the Republican political complex and especially nominee Donald Trump should learn, quickly, if he wants to keep himself out of even more legal trouble. 
In its 144-year history, The Yale Record has never endorsed a Democratic candidate for president. In fact, we have never endorsed any candidate for president. This is, in part, due to our strong commitment to being a tax-exempt 501(c)3 organization, which mandates that we are “absolutely prohibited from directly or indirectly participating in, or intervening in, any political campaign on behalf of (or in opposition to) any candidate for elective public office.” 
This year’s presidential election is highly unusual, but ultimately no different: The Yale Record believes both candidates to be equally un-endorsable, due to our faithful compliance with the tax code. 
In particular, we do not endorse Hillary Clinton’s exemplary leadership during her 30 years in the public eye. We do not support her impressive commitment to serving and improving this country—a commitment to which she has dedicated her entire professional career. Because of unambiguous tax law, we do not encourage you to support the most qualified presidential candidate in modern American history, nor do we encourage all citizens to shatter the glass ceiling once and for all by electing Secretary Clinton on November 8. 
The Yale Record has no opinion whatsoever on Dr. Jill Stein. 
Tax-exempt organizations like The Yale Record and the Donald J Trump Foundation must obey certain rules to keep their tax-exempt status – rules that the Trump Foundation has been flouting for its entire existence. Trump’s been using his private foundation – which is funded almost entirely by the donations of other people – to purchase the political support of different groups throughout his campaign , among other more personal purchases like a $20,000 painting of himself , in clear violation of the tax-exempt rules. 
Trump’s foundation has already been suspended from operating in New York for not having the right certification to solicit donors . Such a flagrant disrespect for the laws of the land and of the spirit of “charity” reveal just what kind of man Donald Trump is – a greedy narcissist with no regard for the well-being of others. So take this non-endorsement to heart and applaud their respect for the rules governing tax-exempt organizations. OccupyDemocrats, however, is under no such restrictions, and we heartily encourage you to help shatter the glass ceiling and make former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton our next president. ",1
Stephen King Just Got Real With Trump Supporters,"  
World famous author Stephen King has a message for the supporters of Donald Trump – a reasonable one that will be immediately ignored, but one that should be heard nonetheless. Trump voters, please think again. Sure, you’re mad. I get that. But you don’t burn down the house because you don’t like the decor. 
— Stephen King (@StephenKing) October 27, 2016 
Trump voters are lashing out after being used and abused by a Republican legislature that has disrespected them and their woes for eight years, funneling the money of the working class up to the richest Americans and passing no meaningful legislation. They have every right to be mad – but voting for Donald Trump is not the answer. Trump’s “plans” for our nation will wreck the economy, undo all the progress of the Obama Recovery, and further divide our country along ethnic and racial lines. 
But it seems like most Trump voters don’t want answers – they just want to be mad.",1
The NRA Just Admitted It Was Always Lying About Obama Confiscating Guns,"  
The NRA has just s tated the obvious – that President Obama does not have the ability to confiscate guns, nor has he ever tried. This statement is an acknowledgment directly from the NRA, after years of warning their members that a Democratic president is going to take away their guns. This debunks the ludicrous “Obama conspiracy” to repeal the Second Amendment and confiscate guns, once and for all. 
The article was featured in NRA magazine, “America’s 1 st Freedom” on June 9 th , in which the author admits that “Congress writes the laws, not the president” and therefore the president does not have the power to repeal the right to bear arms. The piece was written after the author took issue with Obama’s “rude” response to a gun store owner named Rhune, on “gun control,” which is below as follows: 
“First of all, the notion that I or Hillary or Democrats or whoever you want to choose are hell-bent on taking away folks’ guns is just not true. And I don’t care how many times the NRA says it,” declared Obama. 
“I’m about to leave office. There have been more guns sold since I’ve been president than just about any time in U.S. history. There are enough guns for every man, woman and child in this country. And at no point have I ever proposed confiscating guns from responsible gun owners. So it is just not true.” 
The author’s response proves that the NRA has known all along that Dems will not take their guns and now they have publicly admitted it: 
“Congress writes the laws, not the president. He could then have listed the many attacks on the right to bear arms — from Operation Fast and Furious to Operation Choke Point to Obama’s attempted ban on common ammunition for AR-15-type rifles to his using a “pen and phone” to push anti-gun executive actions. But Rhude respectfully stayed silent.” 
Although neither Clinton or Obama have ever claimed they are going to take away guns from law-abiding gun owners, this has been the NRA’s campaign against Democrats for years. The NRA has basically just admitted to blatantly manipulating their members through scare tactics – but it hasn’t stopped them from reviving this tired old conspiracy theory and applying it to Hillary Clinton, who, for the record, does not want to take your guns. 
Indeed, even in the doubtful scenario that Congress and the president agreed to repeal guns, the Supreme Court would veto this as unconstitutional. NRA members need to acknowledge once and for all that a democratic president is not going to seize their firearms and stop listening to the organization that clearly does not have their best interests in mind.",1
Ex-Miss Finland Just Accused Trump Of Sexual Assault,"  
Yet another woman has stepped forward to accuse Republican nominee Donald Trump of sexual assault. Ninni Laaksonen, crowned the 2006 Miss Finland , has become the fourteenth woman to come forward and accuse Trump of unwanted advances. Speaking to local newspaper Ilta-Sanomat, Laaksonen described how moments before she was set to appear on the Late Show With David Letterman , Trump came up to her and began groping her buttocks. 
““Before the show we were photographed outside the building. Trump stood right next to me and suddenly he squeezed my butt. He really grabbed my butt. I don’t think anybody saw it but I flinched and thought: ‘What is happening?’” 
Laaksonen later attended a party with other contestants. “Somebody told me there that Trump liked me because I looked like Melania when she was younger. It left me disgusted.” 
The story echos the complaints made by numerous women about Trump, who boasted on a hot mic of casually committing sexual assault on women he finds attractive. “I’m automatically attracted to beautiful women — I just start kissing them, it’s like a magnet…I don’t even wait. And when you’re a star, they let you do it. You can do anything… Grab ’em by the pussy” said Trump to Entertainment Tonight’s Billy Bush. 
That admission opened the floodgates as dozens of women came forth telling stories that all reinforce each other’s credibility, painting a portrait of a serial predator who treats women’s bodies as objects for him to grope and force himself upon as he pleases. His response to the allegations has been to demean the women, insult them for their looks, and threaten to sue them for “libel.” The consistency of the women’s accounts taken in the context of his own words should leave little doubt in the mind of the American voter of who is telling the truth here.",1
Gary Johnson Just SNAPPED On Reporter Who Called Him Out For Being Dumb,"  
Libertarian nominee Gary Johnson continues to shoot himself in the foot on a daily basis. Just a day after the media took his running mate’s statements to their logical conclusion – a tacit endorsement of Hillary Clinton – Johnson then lost his cool during an interview with the Guardian, in one of the most awkward interviews we’ve ever seen. 
“I could hear some loud voices just then. Is is the same questions? You get the same questions again and again and again?” asks Lewis. “I’m an idiot. Really. I’m the dumbest guy that you’ve ever met in your whole life” replies Johnson. An awkward silence follows while Lewis admits “I’m trying to work out if that’s sarcasm or not.” 
When Lews got to more substantial questions, like how Johnson felt about the fact that every major economist considers Johnson’s proposals to abolish all taxes and replace them with a flat sales tax to be crackpot lunacy, the candidate blew his top and went off on an angry but unrelated rant about how he was considered a fool for proposing marijuana legalization. 
The Libertarian Party never had much chance in the first place, and their poll numbers continue to plummet . Their platform of free-market anarchy and a juvenile obsession with “freedoms” is supported largely by stoned fringe wing-nuts who worship Alex Jones and despise the government in the same way a toddler is infuriated at a parent for not letting them jam a fork into an electric socket. 
The general displeasure with the mainstream candidates created some increased interest in the Libertarian Party, but Gary Johnson’s behavior can be seen as a representation for the party as a whole: unprepared and immature.

The “Blacks For Trump” Guy Is An Ex-Cult Member Who Thinks Obama Is The Devil,"

A New Victim Just Accused Clarence Thomas Of Sexual Assault,"  
In light of the tidal wave of sexual assault allegations leveled at Republican nominee Donald Trump and the firestorm of controversy it has provoked, we shouldn’t be surprised that more women are coming forth to tell their stories of abuse at the hands of powerful men. The latest to step forward is an Alaska lawyer who is accusing conservative Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas of groping her at a dinner party in 1999. 
“He groped me while I was setting the table, suggesting I should sit ‘right next to him. He was 5 or 6 inches down and he got a good handful and he kept squeezing me and pulling me close to him” says Moira Smith, describing how Justice Thomas groped her buttocks at a public event. 
Smith was 23 at the time and is now a vice president at counsel at Enstar Natural Gas Co. Justice Thomas was previously accused of sexually harassing his employee, Anita Hill, in a widely controversial case that ended with the confirmation of Thomas as a Supreme Court Justice and a vicious character assassination campaign against Hill. Hill’s shocking testimony described how : 
In lurid detail, she described Thomas as a boss who pestered her for dates and spoke graphically about pornography, bestiality, rape and his skills as a lover. “He talked about pornographic materials depicting individuals with large penises or large breasts involved in various sex acts,” she testified. The “oddest episode,” Hill said, occurred when he was drinking a Coke in his EEOC office. “He got up from the table at which we were working, went over to his desk to get the Coke, looked at the can and asked, ‘Who has put pubic hair on my Coke?”‘ 
The National Law Journal spoke to three of Smith’s housemates , who all confirm that Smith told them about Thomas’ behavior at the time of the event. Thomas has denied the allegations. 
Sexual assault and the improper behavior of powerful men towards vulnerable employees has dominated this election cycle, beginning first with the wave of allegations against FOX News CEO Roger Ailes by multiple employees and then the accounts of some dozen women recounting the sexual abuse they suffered at the hands of Donald Trump. 
The prominence of the issue has created a space for women to come forward and tell their tales w ith some degree of confiden ce that they will be heard and taken seriously, bravely risking the backlash of misogynistic victim-blaming that has long defined the American response to a woman’s accusation. 
From the military to scientific acedemia to nursing homes , men abuse women and other men at a horrifying rate. It’s far past time we began giving women the benefit of the doubt and send a message to the predators of America that this appalling behavior will no longer be tolerated. For his part, Justice Clarence Thomas has been nothing but an obstacle to progress, mired in backwards conservatism and following the cues of now-deceased religious extremist Antonin Scalia to a tee. Perhaps Scalia shouldn’t be the only seat we replace once Hillary Clinton takes office.",1
Trump Was Asked What He Has In Common With His Daughter. His Answer Is CREEPY,"  
Republican nominee Donald J. Trump has been very vocal about his creepy sexual fetishization of his daughter Ivanka – and yet another deeply uncomfortable video has surfaced of him hitting on his daughter. 
During a 2013 tapping of the “ Wendy Williams Show ,” Donald Trump and daughter Ivanka appeared together as guests. 
Wendy asked each to name what they have in common, during a reoccurring segment called “Fave Five.” While Ivanka safely and logically responded, “real estate” and “golf.” Trump, however, gave the game an incestual twist, replying “Sex.” 
Considering Donald J. Trump’s record at subjecting Ivanka to his perversion, this shouldn’t even be surprising, but it is absolutely disgusting. It is shocking and just plain gross. In 2006, Trump allowed Howard Stern the go-ahead to call Ivanka a “ piece of ass ,” and agreed with this assessment (no pun intended) of his daughter. 
That same year he went on “ The View ,” telling the ladies that he wouldn’t disparage he posing for “Playboy” and that if she wasn’t his daughter he would be dating her. In 2003, he appeared with buddy Howard Stern, bragging about how his daughter’s has the “ best body ,” saying: “You know who’s one of the great beauties of the world, according to everybody? And I helped create her. Ivanka. My daughter, Ivanka. She’s 6 feet tall, she’s got the best body. She made a lot money as a model—a tremendous amount.” 
Trump’s lack of discretion when referring to Ivanka is very, very weird and further proves that Trump is only capable of putting the women he interacts with into two camps: those he would have sex with and those he wouldn’t. That Ivanka is his daughter does not change this. She is a woman he would have sex with, and nothing more. He pitifully can’t even name anything they have in common. All that comes to mind is, as admitted by him, is sex. 
Maybe Republicans should spend their time investigating Trump possibly molesting members of his own family instead of trying to needlessly take down Clinton, before her term (inevitably) starts.

JUST IN: Republicans Sued Over Trump’s Call To Intimidate Minority Voters,"  
The Democratic National Committee just hauled Donald Trump and the Republican National Committee into a federal court demanding that they cease the program of minority voter intimidation that Trump has inspiring his supporters to carry out. The DNC’s lawyers asked a New Jersey federal judge to hold the Republican Party in contempt for violating a 35-year old consent decree to enforce the Voting Rights Act, and to issue an injunction to enforce the terms of the agreement, which will force Republicans to cease their efforts to suppress votes in minority communities during this year’s general election. The DNC lawyers cited Donald Trump’s frequent statements to supporters, as well as one of vice presidential nominee Mike Pence’s speeches where he admitted that the RNC was directly coordinating “ballot integrity” initiatives, which are explicitly banned under the agreement. 
Trump’s overt actions to call his supporters to watch polls in “certain areas” are a classic attempt to concoct an illegal “ballot security program,” which is why we exclusively predicted this lawsuit could happen three weeks ago. Last week, Senator Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) weighed in with an op-ed published in the Washington Post urging the party to take action. This week, the Democratic Coalition Against Trump also took it upon themselves to lodge a new FBI complaint , over Trump’s voter suppression campaign which violates the same Voting Rights Act provisions covered by this recent DNC action which could land Republicans involved in the illegal campaigning – like Roger Stone – in criminal court. However, the Democratic Party’s action is based on a legal decision, so it’s going to be expedited in court, and is likely to yield a rapid order from the federal judge against the Republican party and Trump. 
Here’s a summary of what the DNC’s lawyers filed in federal court today: (see below for complete document ) 
Defendant Republican National Committee (“RNC”) has violated the Final Consent Decree… by supporting and enabling the efforts of the Republican candidate for President, Donald J. Trump, as well as his campaign and advisors, to intimidate and discourage minority voters from voting in the 2016 Presidential Election. Trump has falsely and repeatedly told his supporters that the November 8 election will be “rigged” based upon fabricated claims of voter fraud in “certain areas” or “certain sections” of key states. 
Unsurprisingly, those “certain areas” are exclusively communities in which large minority voting populations reside. Notwithstanding that no evidence of such fraud actually exists, Trump has encouraged his supporters to do whatever it takes to stop it—“You’ve got to get everybody to go out and watch . . . and when [I] say ‘watch,’ you know what I’m talking about, right?”—and has been actively organizing “election observers” to monitor polling stations in “certain areas.” Trump has even encouraged his “watchers” to act like vigilante law enforcement officers. 
Although certain RNC officials have attempted to distance themselves from some of the Trump campaign’s more recent statements, there is now ample evidence that Trump has enjoyed the direct and tacit support of the RNC in its “ballot security” endeavors, including the RNC’s collaboration on efforts to prevent this supposed “rigging” and “voter fraud.” 
In a rally in Denver, Colorado, on August 3, 2016, Trump’s vice presidential running mate, Indiana Governor Mike Pence, admitted that the RNC was directly coordinating with the Trump campaign on “ballot integrity” initiatives, stating that “the Trump campaign and the Republican National Committee are working very very closely with state governments and secretaries of states all over the country to ensure ballot integrity.” 
The RNC’s support of Trump’s efforts to recruit “watchers” who are intended to intimidate voters at their polling places violates this Court’s Consent Decree as modified in 2009, which explicitly forbid the RNC from engaging in so-called “ballot security” measures directly, indirectly, or through its agents or employees. The RNC’s conduct also violates the Consent Decree under well settled law prohibiting defendants from evading court orders by acting in concert with third parties. 
Donald Trump’s master of dirty tricks, Roger Stone is specifically named in the complaint because is the very same political operative, whose minority voter intimidation tactics landed the Republican party in hot water for 35 years in the first place for rigging a close New Jersey gubernatorial election! (which was won by the GOP candidate) 
Roger Stone, one of Trump’s top advisors, has amplified Trump’s message. Stone was a key advisor to the 1981 campaign of former New Jersey Governor Thomas Kean, in which a “ballot security” force wearing black armbands engaged in widespread voter intimidation in Newark, Camden, Paterson and other minority neighborhoods in the State, leading to this very action and the Consent Decree that Stone is helping to violate today. 
Stone is currently running a website called “StopTheSteal.org” that is actively signing up Trump supporters to “volunteer” to fight “voter fraud.” #StopTheSteal is a popular hashtag among Trump supporters on Twitter, and Stone’s group maintains an active Facebook presence. On October 23, 2016, Stone sent out a (now deleted) message via his Twitter feed deliberately designed to mislead Democratic voters by representing—using Secretary Hillary Clinton’s likeness and logo—that supporters can “VOTE the NEW way on Tues. Nov 8th” by texting “HILLARY to 8888,” after which voters would apparently “receive official confirmation. 
Even worse, Roger Stone is trying to hide his voter suppression plan behind the facade of exit polling. DNC lawyers slammed the lunatic Republican political operative for his deception, and the court could order him to jail for contempt of court for his behavior. 
Stone is also using social media to promote the common plan that Trump supporters—and particularly those who have agreed to engage in vigilante “ballot security” efforts—wear red shirts on Election Day. Further Stone is actively recruiting Trump supporters for “exit polling,” specifically targeting nine Democratic-leaning cities with large minority populations. This “exit polling” serves no legitimate purpose: Stone does not run a polling operation. Rather, the plain purpose of this plan is to intimidate minority voters. 
If Donald Trump does not cease his open calls for voter intimidation, the DNC’s legal action could land him in contempt of court – and facing a jail term. 
The RNC is working in active concert with Trump, the Trump campaign, and [Roger] Stone to intimidate and harass minority voters in violation of this Court’s Consent Decree. The Court should use its inherent contempt powers to remedy those violations , and enforce future compliance with the Consent Decree, with sanctions. 
Upon a finding that the RNC has violated the Consent Decree, this Court should issue an order extending the Consent Decree for another eight years, according to the terms of the Decree. 
Republicans have spent a massive amount of time and money litigating to escape this Consent Decree just seven years ago, and obtained a new concession to limit it’s term from infinite – which they agreed to in the 1980s – down to an eight year term which would’ve expired next December. Now that the DNC has taken Trump and the Republican Party back to court, it’s very likely that the terms of the decree will be extended for another eight years through 2025, which will take it through the next two Presidential election cycles. 
Donald Trump has wasted the entire last month complaining about a “rigged election” and encouraging vigilante poll watchers to visit minority neighborhoods. Now, a federal judge will have to step in to keep his campaign from breaking election laws across the country, and the Republican party will pay the price for his ignorance of election law for years to come. 
“The notion of widespread voter fraud in modern American politics is itself a fraud,” said the DNC, “Every attempt to verify the presence of voter fraud has proven fruitless.”

"Fans Asked George Takei To Tweet Something Positive About Trump. He Did, And It’s Perfect","Comments 
Legendary Star Trek actor turned LGBT activist George Takei has been very vocal this election season. He joins much of America in being so utterly appalled by Republican nominee Donald Trump that he cannot stay silent as Trump unravels our democracy further and further with each passing day, and has a perfect response to those asking him to stop being so negative: People have asked me to tweet something positive about Trump. Okay, so be it: I am POSITIVE that Trump is a national disgrace. 
— George Takei (@GeorgeTakei) October 28, 2016 
There is nothing positive to be said about Trump, except that the revelations of his long record of sexual assault is creating a national conversation about the abuse of women at the hands of powerful rich white men. 
Otherwise, Trump has been a walking manifestation of the ugliest parts of America, exposing our dirty laundry for all the world to see. Perhaps its what we needed to exorcise those demons – but it cannot be denied that it will take years to recover from the wounds this election has opened.",1
REVEALED: Hillary Wants Joe Biden To Be Her Secretary Of State,"Comments 
News leaked from Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton’s camp that her transition team wants to persuade or even draft Joe Biden to continue serving America as our nation’s top diplomat after his term as Vice President expires in January. Biden chose not to run to succeed President Obama after the tragic loss of his son Beau Biden; instead he’s thrown himself fully into campaigning for Clinton’s election as only one of America’s most beloved public figures can do. Politico reports : 
Joe Biden is at the top of the internal short list Hillary Clinton’s transition team is preparing for her pick to be secretary of state, a source familiar with the planning tells POLITICO. “He’d be great, and they are spending a lot of time figuring out the best way to try to persuade him to do it if she wins,” said the source familiar with the transition planning. 
The vice president, who chaired the Senate Foreign Relations Committee before joining the administration, is one of the most experienced and respected Democrats on the world stage. He’s also coming to what would be the close of a 44-year career in Washington, first with six terms in the Senate and then two terms as President Barack Obama’s closest adviser — and the keeper of the portfolio on some of the most difficult international issues, including Iraq and Ukraine. 
Hillary hasn’t even told Biden about her idea yet, but it is a logical choice by the Democrat. The news represents a little more traditional political fare for people who are concerned about both the issues a President must master to govern America, but also the team of people they’ll need to manage our country’s affairs. There’s a lot of work to do by the Clinton campaign before naming anyone to any position, but Democrats have closed the gap in absentee early voting with Republicans in key swing states – like Ohio and also in Florida to date. 
Joe Biden is also one amazing politician on the campaign trail, who managed to bait Republican nominee into a verbal sparring match which is distracting his campaign from doing much else than playing defense. Nobody knows if Joe Biden will accept Hillary Clinton’s offer, if the Democratic nominee does in fact become the first female President elect after November 8th, but we do all know that Joe Biden’s heavyweight speeches are having a major impact on this year’s general election campaign.

Trump Won’t Mention That Bush & Cheney Deleted 22 Million Emails,"Comments 
With Donald Trump obsesses over Hillary Clinton’s e-mail “scandal”, one wonders why he never mentions the Bush Administration and the April 12, 2007 revelation that the White House had “lost” 5 million e-mails related to an investigation into the partisan firing of eight U.S. attorneys . Eventually, the true number was found to be over 22 million e-mails. 
Salon reports that: 
The emails had been run through private accounts controlled by the Republican National Committee and were only supposed to be used for dealing with non-administration political campaign work to avoid violating ethics laws. Yet congressional investigators already had evidence private emails had been used for government business, including to discuss the firing of one of the U.S. attorneys. The RNC accounts were used by 22 White House staffers, including then-Deputy Chief of Staff Karl Rove, who reportedly used his RNC email for 95 percent of his communications. 
According to the Washington Post, “Under federal law, the White House is required to maintain records, including e-mails, involving presidential decision- making and deliberations.” But, of course, these millions of e-mails went missing — many of which were important evidence. 
Most troubling, researchers found a suspicious pattern in the White House email system blackouts, including periods when there were no emails available from the office of Vice President Dick Cheney. 
‘“That the vice president’s office, widely characterized as the most powerful vice president in history, should have no archived emails in its accounts for scores of days—especially days when there was discussion of whether to invade Iraq—beggared the imagination,” says Thomas Blanton, director of the Washington-based National Security Archive. The NSA (not to be confused with the National Security Agency, the federal surveillance organization) is a nonprofit devoted to obtaining and declassifying national security documents and is one of the key players in the effort to recover the supposedly lost Bush White House emails. 
As Rove and others were investigated for the partisan “unmasking” of Valerie Plame, a CIA black market specialist, it came to light that Rove’s server was used for official communications — the exact sort required to be preserved under the Presidential Records Act. 
“I wouldn’t rule out that there were a potential 5 million e-mails lost,” White House spokeswoman Dana Perino said at the time. By 2009, it was revealed that Perino’s numbers were a little off when 22 million missing e-mails were discovered. 
The partisan nature of this Clinton email investigation is obvious. How is it not relevant that an administration notorious for committing war crimes and crimes against humanity was able to delete millions of emails without a word from Congress? For all their so called concern for our national security, the Republican Party has an appalling double standard.",1
"Outrage: Pipeline Police Strip-Searched Native Girl, Threw Her Naked Into Cell","Comments 
As the protests against the Dakota Access Pipeline continue to escalate, the crackdown from law enforcement has grown harsher and harsher. Hundreds have been arrested by Morton County police, many of them without charge, and have had their civil rights violated by shockingly cruel police officers, who are sexually humiliating their prisoners by strip-searching them and leaving them naked in their cells. 
When getting booked at the jail, they were all strip searched, forced to “squat and cough” to demonstrate they had nothing hidden in their rectums, then were put in orange jumpsuits. The treatment was the same for Chairman of the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe Dave Archambault, to a pediatrician from the reservation, Dr. Sara Jumping Eagle, to actress Shailene Woodley, star of the films “Divergent” and “Snowden,” among others. 
The use of a strip search for those arrested on trumped-up charges like “trespassing” and “rioting” is a clear intimidation tactic that shows the the United States government still sees Native Americans as savages to be abused. 
LaDonna Brave Bull Allard told The Young Turks how her daughter was arrested, stripped of her clothes by three male and one female officer, and then left naked in a cell overnight. “They’re targeting our families” she said. Human rights abuses have been widely committed by police and security forces as they try to discourage the protesters. 
Rebecca Kemble, Alderwoman from Madison, Wisconsin, recounts how arrested protesters are beaten and thrown into pieces of the very pipeline they are protesting. “I saw the Marathon County deputy push her down the hill and slam her body and head into the transport van after this.” 
Georgianne Nienaber of the Huffington Post knows where to point the finger for these outrageous crimes. 
Sheriff Kyle Kirchmeier is the official who sets the tone for police actions in Morton County North Dakota. He alone determines how prisoners are treated. He holds the authority to enforce humane treatment or encourage cruelty designed to instill fear, humiliation, embarrassment and shame. And shame is the ultimate weapon—utilized by the narcissist in a pitiful attempt to gain control and break the spirit of his victims. 
This kind of systematic violence is the way the U.S. government has always treated the native inhabitants of the American continent. Very little mainstream news coverage is documenting these crimes, instinctively taking the side of the corporation plotting to desecrate the sacred grounds of the Standing Rock Sioux in order to make a quick buck off of climate-warming and water-poisoning fossil fuels. We cannot allow the police state to squash the will of the people.

Republican Senator Launches Disgusting Racist Attack On Veteran Challenger,"Comments 
Struggling Senator Mark Kirk (R-IL) stunned his opponent and his constituents during last night’s debate when he mocked the generations of military service that his Democratic rival’s family have given to this country because they are immigrants. 
Democratic candidate Tammy Duckworth lost both her legs during the Iraq War when a rocket struck the helicopter she was piloting. She knows what it means to fight and suffer serving America, but that wasn’t enough for Republican Senator from Illinois, who is down over 10 points in the polls . Lacking any reason for voters to choose him, the Republican insulted Congresswoman Duckworth to her face about, her ancestry, her military service and the service of generations of her family, which Politico reports happened like this: 
“My family has served this nation in uniform going back to the revolution. I am a daughter of the American Revolution. I’ve bled for this nation,” Duckworth said during the debate. “But I still want to be there in the Senate when the drums of war sound because people are quick to sound the drums of war and I want to be there to say this is what it costs and this is what you’re asking us to do.” 
Duckworth was born in Bangkok to a Thai mother, Lamai, and an American father, Frank, a U.S. Marine who traced his family’s military roots to the Revolutionary War. Frank Duckworth died in 2005. 
“I forgot your parents came all the way from Thailand to serve George Washington,” replied Republican Illinois Senator Mark Kirk. 
Congresswoman Duckworth was left completely speechless on stage after the Republican Senator’s incendiary personal attack. 
However, the Republican’s horrifying attack on the disabled veteran Congresswoman represents everything that he and his party of Trump’s GOP collaborators has become; a group of angry white men, lashing out in a bitterly cruel manner at women, and lashing out at veterans and lashing out at immigrants. 
Until this debate, Senator Kirk had been the most outspoken opponent in his own party of Republican nominee Donald Trump, but his vile moment of truth reveals that he has had one position in public this whole time, and quite another in private which his outburst exposed. Racism is part of the Republican Party’s genetic code and always has been. 
SEN. KIRK: I unendorse Trump 
GOP: See? Not all Republicans are like Trump. We have- 
SEN. KIRK: Mixed-race people aren’t real Americans

Here’s Why The “New” Investigation Into Hillary’s Emails Is Utter BULLSH*T,"Comments 
Various media outlets jumped the gun today when they raced each other to announce that the Federal Bureau of Investigation had reopened their investigation into Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton’s emails. But less than two hours later it’s clear that what actually happened has been blown way out of proportion and out of context. 
FBI Director James Comey announced to Congress today that “investigators are examining newly discovered emails that ‘appear to be pertinent’ to the email probe. Although the FBI cannot yet assess whether or not this material may be significant, and I cannot predict how long it will take us to complete this additional work, I believe it is important to update you.” Clarifying: Comey doesn’t say the FBI is reopening the Clinton investigation per se, rather that it’s assessing newly found emails. 
— Shane Harris (@shaneharris) October 28, 2016 
The investigation is not “reopened”– technically, it was never closed. 
The new emails were not “hidden” or “recovered” or related to her email server in any way. 
The emails were discovered on the cellular device of former Congressman Anthony Wiener as part of an unrelated probe into whether or not Wiener was sending sexually explicit messages and photographs to minors. What the new emails contain is anyone’s guess, but they are not to or from former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton. Wiener’s soon-to-be ex-wife Huma Abedin is a longtime aide to Clinton. 
The media has been just as complicit as the Republican witch-hunters in Congress in perpetuating these baseless smears against the credibility of Hillary Clinton, one of our nation’s most dedicated public servants. 
While Republicans are leaping on this news in hopes it will revive Republican nominee Donald Trump’s flailing campaign, these “developments” are nothing but a non-story from an overly impressionable media desperate for views on a slow Friday afternoon and deserves no more of your time.",1
FBI Director Just Got Hit With Federal Complaint For Hillary Witch-Hunt,"Comments 
  has filed a federal complaint against FBI Director James Comey for the inappropriate partisan use of his official position as the leader our nation’s top federal law enforcement agency. Yesterday, FBI Comey issued a vaguely worded memo to Congressional Republicans about an email loosely linked toHillary Clinton, which House Republican Jason Chaffetz quickly used to punk the media on Twitter, leading to a swirl of false stories about Clinton and emails — most of which required corrections. 
The Department of Justice’s Office of Special Counsel is in charge of enforcing Hatch Act violations when federal employees like FBI Director Comey abuse their offices for political reasons. That’s where DCAT sent their harshly worded complaint: “This is an election year, and we are just 11 days away from the date that the American public votes to choose the next President of the United States, I am writing to ask that an investigation be opened into Director Comey for any potential violations of the Hatch Act. The timing of this announcement, accompanied by the vague facts of the investigation, seems as if Director Comey was making a political move, and not a professional one.” [text of complaint]   filed a complaint with the Department of Justice Office of Professional Responsibility on Friday against FBI Director James Comey for interfering in the Presidential election, following the FBI’s decision to open up an investigation into Secretary Clinton’s emails this close to Election Day. Federal employees are forbidden from participating in political activities under the Hatch Act. “It is absolutely absurd that FBI Director Comey would support Donald Trump like this with only 11 days to go before the election,” said Scott Dworkin, Senior Advisor to the Democratic Coalition Against Trump. “ It is an obvious attack from a lifelong Republican who used to serve in the Bush White House, just to undermine her campaign. Comey needs to focus on stopping terrorists and protecting America, not investigating our soon to be President-Elect Hillary Clinton.” Most federal employees are prohibited from engaging in partisan electioneering under federal law by “ An Act to Prevent Pernicious Political Activities,” otherwise known as the Hatch Act. It makes very narrow exceptions for partisan campaigning by the President, Vice President and a few designated high-ranking members of the Executive Branch of government. The FBI’s Director is not one of those exempt positions, and former Bush appointee James Comey’s vaguely worded memo to Congress reeks of partisan political interference to help fellow desperate Republicans at the end of a hotly contested general election.",1
A Leaked Memo Just Proved Trump’s Housing Discrimination In New York City,"Comments 
A new federal government document has surfaced which details the housing discrimination practices of Donald Trump and his family’s vast Trump Organization’s realty holdings in New York City’s outer boroughs of Queens and Brooklyn. 
It’s the first time that tangible proof of Donald Trump’s history of racial discrimination practices has been confirmed in an official record. 
  found this key document from the archives of University of Michigan’s Law School, markgin the very first time that the complete list of Trump’s covered properties has been discovered. 
The Republican nominee spent most of the 1970s battling federal housing discrimination charges alongside his father, a fact Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton highlighted in an attack ad this week . 
However, Trump has always publicly denied culpability and hid behind the confidentiality of settlement discussions to avoid full disclosure like this new public record document exposes. In fact, he has always never admitted guilt, according to Politifact : 
The case was settled and Trump never admitted guilt, though his company had to agree to stipulations meant to prevent future discrimination at his rental properties. Donald Trump’s Properties Had 75% Fewer Minorities Than Lived Nearby In Other Buildings 
The Trump Organization had 9,050 apartment units covered under the settlement agreement with the federal government, which housed only 399 minority residents across 35 covered properties, or only 4.4% of Fred and Donald Trump’s New York City rental real estate empire. 
The public record document proves the Trump Organization and principals Fred and Donald Trump’s buildings schemed to ignore the Fair Housing Act of 1968 but failed miserably and ultimately landed in court for two years starting in 1973. 
The Trumps eventually capitulated to the government in 1975. 
Keep in mind, the federal government named Donald Trump personally in their Fair Housing complaint, so he wasn’t just a bit player in the dark history of his family business’ illegal management practices — but a named defendant. 
The Justice Department named 39 buildings in their original complaint, which leading to a story entitled, “ Major Landlord Accused of Antiblack Bias ,” on the front page of the New York Times. 
Out of the total of 14,000 units that The Times says the Trump family owned in 1973, 68% of their holdings fell under the settlement. 
The Trumps segregated a small group of non-white tenants into a few of their properties, maintained a single building with just over half minority residents, and virtually excluded minorities from 24 New York City buildings of the 36 total project covered in their 1975 settlement with the federal government which covered a mind-boggling 9,500 apartments. 
Five of the Trump buildings affected had no minority residents whatsoever, and more than half of the buildings had less than ten minority residents. 
There’s also spreadsheet below with easier to read copy of the key public record document proving Trump’s discriminatory housing practices, but you can see the original here: 
Who Wrote This Letter At The Department of Justice Civil Rights Division And Why Did They Write It? 
Drew S. Days, III transmitted the Trump Leak (below) to the Open Housing Center of New York shortly after his appointment by President Carter. It was prepared by career Civil Rights division lawyer Harvey L. Hanley in the summer of 1977, 
Days , was the Assistant Attorney General in charge of the Civil Rights division then, where he personally oversaw the Trump family’s desegregation efforts. 
He went on to become a Yale Law Professor, and eventually the US Solicitor General under President Clinton in 1993. 
Days’ memo reveals that the portfolio of Trump Organization realty which was covered in the 1975 settlement, and their slow progress of racial integration as of July 11th, 1977. 
By then, the Trump Organization had designated two additional buildings to accommodate significant blocks minority renters compared to other buildings. 
But across the board, non-white occupancy rates only went from 4.4% to 7.2% with 663 residents of color housed. 
When you factor out those two buildings – named Argyle Hall and Westminster Hall who accepted 48 of only 264 new minority tenants – the Trump Organization’s overall minority occupancy rate stood at only 6.45%. Trump Organization Management Actively Discriminated Against African-Americans 
The New York Times reported in August that Trump’s property managers – both New York and Cincinnati, Ohio – marked minority housing applications for denial whether they were segregationists or more likely following their orders strictly. One manager spilled the beans on Trump’s discriminatory practices: 
A former Trump superintendent named Thomas Miranda testified that multiple Trump Management employees had instructed him to attach a separate piece of paper with a big letter “C” on it — for “colored” — to any application filed by a black apartment-seeker. 
That wasn’t only reason to date why the federal Department of Justice’s Civil Rights division monitored fully 2/3rds of the Trump family’s realty empire for racial discrimination in the 70s. 
Case records like the one provided by DCAT below show that Trump’s manager would tell prospective tenants that their neighborhoods were safe, “because there were no blacks around.” 
Furthermore, as in many housing discrimination cases, the below court document also documents testers visiting the Trump Organization’s buildings and coming out with different results based on the skin color of the prospective tenant. Federal Court Document from US vs. Trump. Click to Open in New Tab New York’s Minority Population Doubled In the 1970s 
It’s important to note that demographic data from the US Census illuminates this report to show that most of Trump’s buildings had far fewer minorities than the communities in which they sat. 
US Census data indicates that Kings and Queens Counties were the two most populous counties in New York back then, with 4.6 million people in 1970. (doc 2, page 11 in link) US Census Data. Click to Open in New Tab 
Roughly 20% of that 1970 population was listed as African-American. 
By the 1980 US Census , the population of the two New York City boroughs dipped slightly, however the percentage of African-American and hispanic residents in the two boroughs was 40% of the population. (pages 29-30 in link) 
This data demonstrates that the Trump Organization’s covered apartments only had one fourth of the proportion of minority residents compared their surrounding neighborhoods in the mid-1970s, while 15% percent of their properties had zero African-Americans residing inside them. 
For the purposes of this story, we used the blended average of minority population in both districts, since there’s a large portfolio of buildings. Conclusion 
Donald Trump settled a federal Fair Housing Act lawsuit because most of his buildings often had few, or even no minority residents. 
A careful examination of his record shows that his family’s real estate empire systematically excluded African-Americans from its housing, and even after settling with the US Department of Justice, the Trump Organization continued to use the same tactics of loading just a few properties with most of the minority tenants.",1
"FBI Director Just Admitted His New Hillary Probe Is A Smear To Help Trump, GOP","Comments FBI Director James Comey just followed up his first memo to Congress with a “cover your ass” memo to his staff in The Washington Post. The impact within the FBI has been swift after the first memo. Newsweek is reporting that the Republican FBI Director’s inappropriate letter to Congress put him in a very danger of a “mutiny at the FBI,” whose proper role is protecting America from domestic terror threats and investigating serious crimes – not influencing elections. In the FBI Director’s second letter, he admitted that his agency doesn’t “ordinarily tell Congress about ongoing investigations,” and that he doesn’t know anything about, “the significance of this newly discovered collection of emails.” He also claimed that, “I don’t want to create a misleading impression,” and Comey then made a final admission that, “in the middle of an election season, there is a signficant risk of being misunderstood.” Well, it’s too late now. FBI Dir. Comey sent a second letter today – to FBI employees. He seems to have some doubts about what he did (via WashPost) pic.twitter.com/IagFJRZYyU 
— West Wing Reports (@WestWingReport) October 29, 2016 Newsweek’s report about this latest non-scandal points out firmly that the FBI Director’s letter literally points out emails that have nothing to do with the Democratic nominee. 
The disclosure by the Federal Bureau of Investigation late on Friday, October 28 that it had discovered potential new evidence in its inquiry into Hillary Clinton’s handling of her personal email when she was Secretary of State has virtually nothing to do with any actions taken by the Democratic nominee, according to government records and an official with knowledge of the investigation, who spoke to Newsweek on condition of anonymity. The revelation that the FBI has discovered additional emails convulsed the political world, and led to widespread (and erroneous) claims and speculation. 
Moreover, despite the widespread claims in the media that this development had prompted the FBI to “reopen” of the case, it did not; What we know: FBI found some emails on a new device. They dont know whats in them or if they're copies or if they're classified. That's it. 
— Kurt Eichenwald (@kurteichenwald) October 29, 2016 Sources inside the FBI told Newsweek they were furious with Director Comey’s rare public revelations from the Clinton investigation from the start. Comey’s decision to leak news about a politically driven investigation is threatening his professional standing and ability to function inside the Bureau. Newsweek’s top investigative reporter Kurt Eichenwald told the story in a tweetstorm: Word from inside @FBI . FURIOUS at Comey, think he's mishandled public revelations from get go.

— Kurt Eichenwald (@kurteichenwald) October 29, 2016 
The FBI has a difficult job to perform in the best of times, and when it comes to political investigations agents must walk a tightrope between performing their duties properly, and unduly influencing public opinion with the results of their investigations. For an entire year, they managed to quietly, but diligently investigate the sensitive matters surrounding Hillary Clinton’s emails which they ultimately concluded, “were not a cliff-hanger” because there was literally no there, there. 
These events show precisely why the FBI does not ordinarily publicly release the results or targets of their investigations until charges are filed. 
These memos have set off a chain off events sure to end with the termination of his tenure as head of the agency. A serious criminal complaint has already been levied against him by the Democratic Coalition Against Trump for engaging in partisan activity. Related Items:",1
A Trump Fan Just Hung Two Black Dummies From A Tree In His Front Yard,"Comments 
Republicans often talk about yard signs in their neighborhood as proof of their candidate’s fitness for office, but a photograph of one Florida resident’s Trump sign with lynched black people hanging from a tree has gone viral. It’s a terrifying reminder of the pervasive racial hatred pitched by Donald Trump’s new Republican Party, which he normalized by accepting the endorsement of former KKK chief David Duke and by leading the “alt-right” movement to Make America Discriminatory Again. 
Miami’s New Times reports : There needs to be a hell of a lot of hate in your heart to think lynching people on Halloween is funny. And yet, here we are, Miami. A homeowner in Three Lakes, a small community in suburban Kendall, is celebrating the holiday by lynching two black-looking dummies in his or her yard. It’s also impossible to ignore what’s just in front of the display on the same lawn: A “Trump/Pence 2016” sign. 
The two men are faceless, but their skin appears to be dark. They’re each wearing traditionally “hip-hop” clothing: One of the dead men has a sports jersey on and a crooked baseball cap, and the other has his pants sagged low. Black activists have been circulating the photos on Facebook all day and calling for a quick response from the neighborhood. The community’s property manager, Orelys Canas, tells New Times they’ve contacted the homeowner and asked him or her to remove the installation. 
After the story went viral, the homeowner contacted the local news to pretend that his lynching display was actually some form of tolerance. They also claimed that the Trump/Pence sign didn’t even belong to them, but other tipsters made it clear that the entire display clearly depicted a lynching scene with a Trump sign. 
Trump supporters instantly bombarded the news editors who published the chilling photos: Well it took exactly ten minutes for a guy to suggest Hillary planted the lynched black dummies at a Trump supporter's house #wakeupsheeple pic.twitter.com/MbIoC0PQds

It’s unconscionable that anyone would present a mock lynching in their neighborhood and portray it as anything other than an act of racial hatred. Shamefully, the Republican Party and their dreadful presidential nominee Donald Trump have done everything within their power this year to normalize racism and bigotry. 
This is the end result:",1
A Trump Fan Just Put Hillary In An Electric Chair On His Front Lawn,"Comments 
A suburban Detroit homeowner and Trump supporter just took the Republican Party platform and proudly displayed it on his front lawn, creating a despicably terrifying display of Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton sitting in a mock electric chair, screaming in agony as she is executed. 
The photo of the offensive display was taken by a reader in Waterford Township, a suburb northwest of Detroit which is 89% populated by white residents. It’s unknown if authorities have been alerted, but this display is the end result of months of extremist electioneering by the Trump and Republican Party, who have been hell-bent on dehumanizing   
American politics never had a tradition of demanding the jailing of one’s political opponent, nor to encouragement of supporters to engage in political violence, but that’s today’s Republican Party under Donald Trump. His campaign has broken America’s political taboos with open calls for violence, even winding up under Secret Service investigation twice. Trump himself drew an unprecedented public scolding from the Secret Service for saying that “ second amendment people ” should take matters into their own hands if/when he Hillary beats him. 
Trump’s sycophantic surrogates Chris Christie and Rudy Giuliani completely debased the high titles of their former prosecutorial offices within the federal government by calling for Hillary Clinton to be “locked up.” Sadly, that has become the only policy proposal of the Republican Party — beyond Trump’s plans to kiss up to Russia’s dictator Vladimir Putin and Mike Pence’s plan to manage women’s health with scripture. 
Now, Trump’s followers have internalized the calls for political violence, and here is is the result in suburban Michigan: 
It doesn’t get any more deplorable than this, folks.",1
Elizabeth Warren Just Blasted The FBI Director For Going After Hillary Instead Of Wall Street Crooks,"Comments 
In the wake of a string of completely extraordinary revelations starting this summer by FBI Director James Comey, Senator Warren is now demanding that the FBI release investigatory details about the 14 corporations and 11 individuals which the Financial Crisis Inquiry Commission (FCIC) referred for criminal prosecution in 2010; 
“Your recent actions with regard to the investigation of former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton provide a clear precedent for releasing additional information about the investigation of the parties responsible for the financial crisis. 
These new standards present a compelling case for public transparency around the fate of the FCIC referrals. If Secretary Clinton’s email server was of sufficient interest to establish a new FBI standard of transparency, then surely the criminal prosecution of those responsible for the 2008 financial crisis should be subject to the same level of transparency. 
As a consequence of the 2008 crash, trillions of dollars in American housing wealth was destroyed. Millions of Americans were touched personally as they lost their homes, their jobs, or both. Hundreds of pension funds were eviscerated, and millions of retirees saw their financial futures wiped out. Congress created the FCIC to examine what went wrong and to determine Whether any individuals or entities deserved law enforcement scrutiny as a result of their actions in this crisis. The FCIC followed the law and sent such referrals to the DOJ, yet not a single senior Wall Street executive has ever been criminally prosecuted. 
For the uncounted millions of Americans whose lives were changed forever and for those who are still dealing with the consequences of the crash, I can think of no matter of intense public interest about which the American people deserve the details than the issue of what precisely happened to the criminal referrals that followed the 2008 crash.” 
Until now, the FBI has never, ever released the investigatory file of anyone or any institution it has targeted. However, if the Democratic nominee herself was a bank, then she would have nothing to fear from the FBI. 
Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren is laser focused on protecting the American people from shady banks and financial scams, but the newly transparent FBI apparently doesn’t share her concern since those investigations don’t involve Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton. To date, no executive has been criminally prosecuted for financial crimes by banks, Wall Street firms and lending institutions which caused the Great Bush Recession’s mass unemployment and foreclosure epidemic. 
Of 25 entities named by the FCIC to be criminally investigated , only one actual person has paid a civil penalty, and another person – none other than Daniel Mudd, former CEO of mortgage giant Fannie Mae, was fined — but had his $100,000 penalty paid by the government sponsored enterprise that employed him. 
FBI Director James Comey has deployed a massive double standard to protect the criminal financial institutions, handing them a free pass and complete secrecy for collapsing our national economy and wiping out $3 Trillion dollars in home equity, stock equity and savings, while dragging Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton through the mud for Comey’s partisan predilections for transparency when she’s demonstrably done absolutely nothing wrong. 
The FBI Director himself admitted in July that “no reasonable prosecutor” would bring charges against the Democratic nominee, yet he himself cannot resist rehashing and releasing the investigatory details in public over and over. Releasing anything about an investigation, or even delivering an actual indictment, actually violates Department of Justice policy to remain silent in the 60 days before an election. It’s been described by former top Justice Department officials as the “difference between being independent and flying solo.” 
Elizabeth is right. How long will the FBI wait to deliver transparency to the American people eight years after their jobs, homes and savings were attacked by irresponsible bankers? 
Once the FBI completes disclosing those investigatory files, then how long will it take for them to deliver indictments and justice to the men and women who caused the Great Recession? 
Neither can happen soon enough. For now, he needs to stop his partisan witch-hunt against Hillary and start going after the real crook.s",1
Top Bush Admin. Official Just Filed Ethics Complaint Against FBI Director For Partisan Meddling (UPDATED),"Comments 
FBI Director James Comey is being publicly criticized by former Deputy Attorney Generals and others from the law enforcement community over breaking his agency’s neutrality to release a vague memo Friday afternoon which amounted to official slander against Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton. Newsweek’s Kurt Eichenwald reported first that University of Minnesota law professor and former Bush Administration White House ethics counsel Richard Painter filed an official ethics complaint with the Department of Justice’s Office of Special Counsel against the FBI Director for abusing his office with pernicious political activity. 
Richard Painter’s new filing against Comey is similar to the complaint filed by the Democratic Coalition Against Trump , lodged against the FBI Director for violating the Hatch Act , which restricts most federal employees from engaging in any partisan activity. Hours after originally filing this story, Professor Painter wrote this op-editorial in The New York Times to explain why the FBI Director’s actions must not go unpunished: 
On Saturday, I filed a complaint against the F.B.I. with the Office of Special Counsel, which investigates Hatch Act violations, and with the Office of Government Ethics. I have spent much of my career working on government ethics and lawyers’ ethics, including two and a half years as the chief White House ethics lawyer for President George W. Bush, and I never thought that the F.B.I. could be dragged into a political circus surrounding one of its investigations. Until this week. 
An official doesn’t need to have a specific intent — or desire — to influence an election to be in violation of the Hatch Act or government ethics rules. The rules are violated if it is obvious that the official’s actions could influence the election, there is no other good reason for taking those actions, and the official is acting under pressure from persons who obviously do want to influence the election. Absent extraordinary circumstances that might justify it, a public communication about a pending F.B.I. investigation involving a candidate for public office that is made on the eve of an election is thus very likely to be a violation of the Hatch Act and a misuse of an official position. Serious questions also arise under lawyers’ professional conduct rules that require prosecutors to avoid excessive publicity and unnecessary statements that could cause public condemnation even of people who have been accused of a crime, not to mention people like Mrs. Clinton, who have never been charged with a crime. This is no trivial matter. We cannot allow F.B.I. or Justice Department officials to unnecessarily publicize pending investigations concerning candidates of either party while an election is underway. That is an abuse of power. Allowing such a precedent to stand will invite more, and even worse, abuses of power in the future. 
Ironically, the Hatch Act was passed because Republicans thought that employees from one of FDR’s New Deal agencies were involved in partisan electioneering. Little did they know that, today, a registered Republican FBI Director was going to violate it blatantly right before an election. Painter and Comey were colleagues in the Bush Administration when the latter held a position as Deputy Attorney General. 
High ranking current Department of Justice officials discouraged Comey from going public just 11 days before a general election. 
Shamefully, it’s been revealed that the FBI doesn’t even have a warrant to view these newest emails yet. 
Former Deputy Attorney Generals Jamie Gorelick and Larry Thomspon, who served Administration with both parties, issued a harshly worded op-ed in The Washington Post today entitled, “ James Comey is Damaging Our Democracy .” They opined: 
As former deputy attorneys general in the Bill Clinton and George W. Bush administrations, we are troubled by the apparent departure from these standards in the investigation of Hillary Clinton’s email server. First, the FBI director, James B. Comey, put himself enthusiastically forward as the arbiter of not only whether to prosecute a criminal case — which is not the job of the FBI — but also best practices in the handling of email and other matters. Now, he has chosen personally to restrike the balance between transparency and fairness, departing from the department’s traditions. As former deputy attorney general George Terwilliger aptly put it , “There’s a difference between being independent and flying solo.” 
At the same time, Attorney General Loretta E. Lynch — nominally Comey’s boss — has apparently been satisfied with advising Comey but not ordering him to abide by the rules. She, no doubt, did not want to override the FBI director in such a highly political matter, but she should not have needed to. He should have abided by the policy on his own. 
The FBI Director broke policy to inform Congress about details of an investigation without any actual details, or having even seen the new evidence that was so urgent that he had to break decades of policy in order to disclose it. 
Even stone age conservatives knew that these latest allegations are nothing more than a partisan political ploy, describing the Trump campaign’s reaction in grim terms: In Trumpworld as Hitler's Bunker terms, this is probably like when Goebbels thought FDR's death would save the Nazi regime. 
— Ross Douthat (@DouthatNYT) October 28, 2016 
Within hours of Comey’s official memo breaking, he released an internal “cover your ass” memo admitting that the letter could be misinterpreted, which was instantly leaked to the Washington Post and proved that the FBI Director understood fully the foolishness upon which he had embarked by interfering with an election. 
Newsweek pointed out that Republican President George W. Bush had undergone FBI investigation himself before being elected, but nobody in the Clinton White House or the FBI used it to torpedo his 2000 presidential campaign. Bush investigated in 96. Cleared. Imagine if FBI came out in 2000, just be4 election, said ""new evidence, dont know what it means."" Horrible 
— Kurt Eichenwald (@kurteichenwald) October 30, 2016 
Amazingly, a blogger made requests in 2004 before the election and did get the FBI to release some files about then-President Bush in April of 2005, only five months after the election, but he suspected that they didn’t provide everything and the records show that his requests to expedite release because of the election were denied. The Bush FBI files contained nothing about the events reported by Kurt Eichenwald. 
The two former Deputy Attorney Generals said it best : 
As it stands, we now have real-time, raw-take transparency taken to its illogical limit, a kind of reality TV of federal criminal investigation. Perhaps worst of all, it is happening on the eve of a presidential election. It is antithetical to the interests of justice, putting a thumb on the scale of this election and damaging our democracy. 
Now, the FBI’s top leadership is in open revolt over the Director’s political meddling as bipartisan condemnation is raining down upon the FBI Director, as his colleagues are openly telling the press that their boss compromised their agency to play partisan politics. 
It’s probably only a matter of time before Comey resigns and faces his own investigation for this entire sordid affair.",1
Trump’s Ex-Manager: He Didn’t Even Know What A Gold Star Family Is,"Comments 
Donald Trump, the draft-dodging Russophile who cloaks his xenophobia and bigotry in a veneer of false patriotism, reportedly had to ask what a Gold Star family was after he attacked the Muslim-American parents of war hero Capt. Humayun Khan. Trump has thus once again proven his patriotic rhetoric to be nothing but ignorant and self-serving bombast. 
The Trump-Khan feud arose after Khizr Khan, Capt. Khan’s father, gave a powerful speech at the Democratic National Convention over the summer repudiating Trump’s hateful anti-Muslim rhetoric. Khan said that Trump had “sacrificed nothing” while he and his wife had paid the ultimate sacrifice for America, and famously held up his pocket-size Constitution and offered to lend it to Trump. Trump, who seems physically incapable of responding to criticism with anything other than blustering attacks, went on a tirade against Mr. Khan, adding for good measure that his wife Ghazala was not allowed to speak at the DNC because she is a Muslim. 
When one of Trump’s advisers warned him against attacking a Gold Star family, Trump reportedly responded, “what’s that?” Paul Manafort, Trump’s campaign manager at the time, apparently had to repeatedly explain to the candidate that a Gold Star family is a family that has lost a loved one serving in war. In a surprising bit of pushback from a Trump campaign staff that seems to consist overwhelmingly of yes men, Manafort reportedly told Trump in response to his feud with Khan that the election “is about the American people, it’s not about you.” 
That Trump has the audacity to criticize war heros like Capt. Khan and Sen. John McCain after using his privilege to avoid war and knowing nothing of their sacrifice, that he is so presumptuous as to adopt the mantle of fighting for America while knowing nothing about American institutions, is proof that he is nothing but an opportunistic demagogue who will say anything to appease his own ego. In stark contrast to Trump’s sleaze, however, Khizr Khan has, in the best American tradition, taken the high road. 
Khan has continued to speak out for American values and against Trump’s hate-peddling. Last week he said that “there comes a time in an ordinary citizen’s life where you have to gather all the courage you have and you stand up and speak against tyranny and speak against un-American hate.” Khan has continued to get under Trump’s skin, with the nominee replying to that speech with the hackneyed lie that he opposed the Iraq war. Perhaps the reason Trump has been so irritated by Mr. Khan is that he has demonstrated so much better than Mr. Trump himself what it means to be a true American.",1

Harry Reid Just Accused FBI Of Hiding “Explosive Info” About Trump & Putin,"Comments 
Democratic Senate leader Harry Reid just sent a scathing open letter to FBI Director James Comey, calling him out for smearing Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton while hiding a sinister truth about Donald Trump that the public deserves to know. In it, he accuses the controversial FBI Director of sitting on secret “explosive” intelligence information about the Republican presidential campaign’s coordination with Russian strongman Vladimir Putin. Reid wrote : 
The double standard established by your actions is clear. 
In my communications with you and other top officials in the national security community, it has become clear that you possess explosive information about close ties and coordination between Donald Trump, his top advisors, and the Russian government – a foreign interest openly hostile to the United States, which Trump praises at every opportunity. The public has a right to know this information. I wrote to you months ago calling for this information to be released to the public. There is no danger to American interests from releasing it. And yet, you continue to resist calls to inform the public of this critical information. 
By contrast, as soon as you came into possession of the slightest innuendo related to Secretary Clinton, you rushed to publicize it in the most negative light possible. Moreover, in tarring Secretary Clinton with thin innuendo, you overruled longstanding tradition and the explicit guidance of your own Department. 
You rushed to take this step eleven days before a presidential election, despite the fact that for all you know, the information you possess could be entirely duplicative of the information you already examined which exonerated Secretary Clinton. 
Senator Reid continued by notifying Comey of violating the Hatch Act, whic forbids federal employees from engaging in partisan acts. Even further, Reid said that he regretted helping President Obama break a long Republican filibuster of his nomination to head the FBI just three short years ago. 
It’s not surprising that there is a tangible link between Putin and Trump, especially after an interview of the Republican claiming he has a relationship with the Russian dictator was unearthed by the Democratic Coalition Against Trump and authenticated by MSNBC host Thomas A. Roberts this week . 
Which begs the question, what is the Republican Party’s standard bearer hiding regarding his dealings with Vladimir Putin? Related Items:",1
Democrats & Republicans Just Joined Forces To Condemn Comey’s Partisan Smears,"Comments 
I learned exclusively tonight that the Democratic Coalition Against Trump is being joined by University of Minnesota Law Professor Richard Painter in a non-partisan joint campaign to mount a public campaign against an expedite a response to their parallel complaints against FBI Director James Comey for his partisan witch-hunt of Hillary Clinton. 
Painter is a former Bush Administration White House Counsel who served as ethics counsel to the President. 
“Richard Painter and I connected this evening, and we are sending out the message clearly that the FBI Director’s behavior is a non-partisan issue, and we will be sending out a joint press release tomorrow morning accordingly,” said Scott Dworkin, Senior Adivsor to the Democratic Coalition Against Trump. 
Both parties seek to prevent future political interference by America’s top federal law enforcement agency into partisan elections. 
“We plan to make joint television and other media appearances together with Professor Painter,” said Dworkin who plans to participate in the broadcasts, “or alongside other members of the DCAT.” 
Each independently made similar complaints to Department of Justice’s Office of Special Counsel’s ruling about the FBI Director’s recent memo . 
Because the memo has intruded on this year’s presidential election, DCAT and Painter are alleging that FBI Director Comey’s violated the Hatch Act, which prohibits pernicious partisan use of office by federal employees or officials. 
The FBI Director ignored Justice Department policy guidance which proscribes public investigatory actions within 60-days of an election. It’s a policy that has been respected across parties and administrations for decades to keep justice and elections un-entwined. 
Justice officials specifically advised Comey of the policy . 
He sent a mea culpa letter to other FBI agents just hours after the election-impacting memo. 
The Democratic Coalition Against Trump filed the first reported Hatch Act complaint against FBI Director Comey in the wake of his unusual memo Friday afternoon. 
Yesterday, Professor Richard Painter filed his own Hatch Act and ethics complaint against the FBI Director and an ethics complaint over the same memo, which is also drawing the ire of the career professionals at the top federal investigatory agency.",1
October Surprise: ABC Uncovers “Millions” of Payments From Russia To Trump,"Comments 
Republican nominee Donald Trump has been treading treasonous territory for months now, raising eyebrows around the nation for a foreign policy that openly supports the ambitions of Vladimir Putin, the dictator of the Russian Federation. He’s surrounded himself with men with close ties to the Kremlin and the oligarchs that pull the strings behind the scenes; he’s being openly supported by Russian state-controlled media and by Russian intelligence services, who have breached the electronic servers of Democratic Party operatives and released selected pieces of information in an attempt to sow discord. 
Throughout all of this, Trump has insisted that he has no business ties to Russia. “For the record, I have ZERO investments in Russia” he tweeted in July. Now – brace yourself, this might come as a shock – it appears he’s been lying to us the whole time. 
An ABC News investigation has found that Donald Trump has “numerous ties” to Russian interests both here in the United States and in Russia. “The level of business amounts to hundreds of millions of dollars — what he received as a result of interaction with Russian businessmen. They were happy to invest with him, and they were happy to work with Donald Trump. And they were happy to associate—[and] be associated with Donald Trump” says Sergei Millian, who heads a U.S.-Russia business group. 
Trump has reaped huge profits off his business deals with Russian oligarchs that stretch from hosting the 2013 Miss Universe contest in Moscow and selling Trump-branded real estate to “large numbers” of Russian buyers – so many that the Sunny and Hollywood Islands in Florida became known as “Little Moscow.” 
The oligarchs of Russia made their fortunes by making deals to acquire huge numbers of shares in the state-owned companies of the former Soviet Union as the country shifted to a free-market economy, turning them into billionaires overnight. Towards the end of the Boris Yeltsin era, the oligarchs controlled 50% to 75% of all Russian finance. Now, they use their influence and wealth to prop up the Putin regime, while he turns a blind eye as they rob the country blind. Putin himself has amassed a fortune of $70 billion that could be as high as $200 billion . 
The oligarchs are constantly looking to funnel their ill-gotten gains out of the country, and it turns out purchasing Trump properties was a favored way to do so. It makes sense – they are all men cut from the same gold cloth. They are self-entitled narcissistic materialists who care for nothing but increasing their own personal wealth. 
“I think material wealth for them is a highly emotional and spiritual thing. They spend a lot of money on their own personal consumption…They don’t read books. They don’t go to [art] exhibitions. They think the only way to impress anyone is to buy a yacht” says former KGB agent Alexander Lebedev , who went on to describe them as “cultural ignoramuses…not interested in social justice.” Sound like anyone we know? 
When the US State Department leveled sanctions on the Russian oligarchs in 2014 following Moscow’s annexation of the Crimea, the oligarchs had one of their key money-laundering tools cut off. If Trump were president, however, he could end the sanctions and allow them to continue to enrich themselves – and Trump himself. “We’ll be looking at that, yeah we’ll be looking” said Trump on the issue of sanctions in July. 
These business dealings obviously present a great conflict of interest between the personal finances of a potential President and the foreign policy of our nation, which seeks to curtail the disruptive and corrupting influences of the Russian oligarchs and put a check on Russian territorial aggression in Eastern Europe. Would President Trump be able to put his personal profits aside? If this election has taught us anything at all, it’s that Trump cares about nothing but himself. We cannot allow him and his Russian cronies to take their corruption to the White House.

A Congressman Just Revealed Who Is Behind Comey’s Email Smear,"Comments 
Democratic Rep. Elijah Cummings (D-MD) was the ranking minority member on the House Benghazi committee, so he knows firsthand how Republican witch-hunts work from up close personal experience. 
On CNN’s New Day this morning, he revealed the real motivation behind the FBI Director’s stunningly improper memo to Congress last week. 
“I don’t think the American people have a clue how hard the Republicans – particularly on my committee – have been on the FBI. This is a man – Director Comey – who they loved. They said he was the greatest thing in the world, very honorable.” 
“When he came out with the decision in July to not prosecute Mrs. Clinton, they suddenly turned against him. He knows that if he makes any misstep, the Republicans are going to be all over him and they’re going to try and bring harm to him. The thing that he did say in our hearing, and it stuck with me, is that ‘there should not be a double standard to the disadvantage of Mrs. Clinton.'” 
That’s right, it is heavily implied that the FBI Director was so intimidated by Congressional Republicans and their innuendo machines that he caved in and fed them the kind of vaguely worded red meat memo the Trump campaign desperately needed to keep their failing campaign on life support. 
Even Comey himself admitted that his memo was going to be widely misinterpreted , which is probably why CNN’s host began her interview with Congressman Cummings by saying, “Trump is lying about the email probe.” 
It hasn’t taken long for the roof to cave in on Comey’s career anyway, as his obvious meddling in the election has drawn bipartisan complaints about illegal electioneering by the FBI Director, his former boss to condemn his actions and for the Senate minority leader Harry Reid to demand answers from the FBI about the Republican candidate’s love affair with Russian dictator Vladimir Putin. Reid’s point was not lost on the Congressman from Maryland who told CNN: 
“There has been a lot of information out there about Mr. Trump, Mr. Manafort and the Russian government and alleged attempts to take over our election. Members of Congress have asked for months, for the FBI to provide us with information if Mr. Trump, Mr. Manafort and any elements of the Russian government have any coordination or connection with each other.” 
“They have not given us one syllable. So the question here is: Do we have a double standard here?” 
Of course there’s a double standard! 
The FBI has a responsibility to keep certain things secret, and when it comes to partisan elections that responsibility is key to the ability of our electoral democracy’s basic functioning. Newsweek’s Kurt Eichenwald pointed out cogently that Republican George W. Bush was investigated by the FBI in 1996, prior to running for President. Yet, the Clinton White House didn’t grab his FBI file and air all of the dirty laundry claiming a very partisan need for transparency during an election. Otherwise, the FBI could decide to influence every election in America, and over time the FBI would pick the elected officials to their liking. 
Nothing can un-ring the bell that FBI Director Comey struck by letting loose his vague memo, but everyone can understand there is a sexist, partisan and blatant double standard at play by Republicans celebrating a vague memo, which only happened because an official sworn to be non-partisan decided he valued his political career more than the integrity of our electoral system

Furious Eric Holder Just Issued A Dire Warning About Comey’s Partisan Smears,"Comments 
Former US Attorney General Eric Holder just wrote an op-ed warning the American people to disregard the FBI Director James Comey’s unprecedented decision to release information about an ongoing investigation during the heat of an election. Comey released a vague memo when he had little more to go on other than a mere suspicion and is now facing bipartisan calls for removal from office. Democratic congressional staffers now claim that their first warning of the Comey memo was when a House Republican tweeted it out with the usual anti-Hillary spin. That alone demonstrates exactly what Holder wrote about preventing “investigations from unfairly or unintentionally casting public suspicion,” which happened nearly instantly on Friday afternoon. 
Former Attorney General Holder also pointed out that Comey’s “newly discovered” emails have no known significance and that the FBI Director violated long standing policies in the Department of Justice – which are non-partisan – aimed at upholding the integrity of America’s form of electoral democracy, free from government intervention: 
I understand the gravity of the work our Justice Department performs every day to defend the security of our nation, protect the American people, uphold the rule of law and be fair. That is why I am deeply concerned about FBI Director James B. Comey’s decision to write a vague letter to Congress about emails potentially connected to a matter of public, and political, interest. That decision was incorrect. 
The department also has a policy of not taking unnecessary action close in time to Election Day that might influence an election’s outcome. These rules have been followed during Republican and Democratic administrations. They aren’t designed to help any particular individual or to serve any political interest. Instead, they are intended to ensure that every investigation proceeds fairly and judiciously; to maintain the public trust in the department’s ability to do its job free of political influence; and to prevent investigations from unfairly or unintentionally casting public suspicion on public officials who have done nothing wrong. 
Director Comey broke with these fundamental principles. I fear he has unintentionally and negatively affected public trust in both the Justice Department and the FBI. And he has allowed — again without improper motive — misinformation to be spread by partisans with less pure intentions. Already, we have learned that the importance of the discovery itself may have been overblown. According to the director himself, there is no indication yet that the “newly discovered” emails bear any significance at all. And yet, because of his decision to comment on this development before sufficient facts were known, the public has faced a torrent of conspiracy theories and misrepresentations. 
High ranking former Justice Department officials like Eric Holder do not make a career out of slamming their former colleagues, so it’s a very rare break in the ranks to see a former Attorney General publicly slam his former subordinate. The Hatch Act prevents federal officials from interfering in partisan elections and strictly demands that public officials refrain from doing anything that could impact an election. Holder wrote : 
I served with Jim Comey and I know him well. This is a very difficult piece for me to write. He is a man of integrity and honor. I respect him. But good men make mistakes. In this instance, he has committed a serious error with potentially severe implications. It is incumbent upon him — or the leadership of the department — to dispel the uncertainty he has created before Election Day. It is up to the director to correct his mistake — not for the sake of a political candidate or campaign but in order to protect our system of justice and best serve the American people. 
FBI Director James Comey knew better than to release a vague memo about an ongoing investigation, which, even under normal circumstances, should never be done. That is why former Attorney General Holder felt compelled to rebuke him in this scathing op-ed. 
Hopefully, the current members of the Justice Department tasked with reviewing the bipartisan complaints read the memo and expedite their decision concerning the future of the FBI Director. 
It should not take long for any rational investigator to determine that James Comey’s “cry wolf” memo was little more than a partisan prop handed to a failing campaign — and to remove the FBI Director from his office.",1

Cummings is heavily implying that the FBI Director was so intimidated by Congressional Republicans and the threat of being dragged in front of a Congressional investigation committee himself that he caved in and fed them the kind of vaguely worded red meat memo the Trump campaign desperately needed to keep their failing campaign on life support. 
Even Comey himself admitted that his memo was going to be widely misinterpreted , which is probably why CNN’s host began her interview with Congressman Cummings by saying, “Trump is lying about the email probe.” 
It hasn’t taken long for the roof to cave in on Comey’s career anyway, as his obvious meddling in the election has drawn bipartisan complaints about illegal electioneering by the FBI Director, his former boss to condemn his actions and for the Senate minority leader Harry Reid to demand answers from the FBI about the Republican candidate’s love affair with Russian dictator Vladimir Putin. Reid’s point was not lost on the Congressman from Maryland who told CNN: 
“There has been a lot of information out there about Mr. Trump, Mr. Manafort and the Russian government and alleged attempts to take over our election. Members of Congress have asked for months, for the FBI to provide us with information if Mr. Trump, Mr. Manafort and any elements of the Russian government have any coordination or connection with each other.” 
“They have not given us one syllable. So the question here is: Do we have a double standard here?” 
Of course there’s a double standard! 
The FBI has a responsibility to keep certain things secret, and when it comes to partisan elections that responsibility is key to the ability of our electoral democracy’s basic functioning. Newsweek’s Kurt Eichenwald pointed out cogently that Republican George W. Bush was investigated by the FBI in 1996, prior to running for President. Yet, the Clinton White House didn’t grab his FBI file and air all of the dirty laundry claiming a very partisan need for transparency during an election. Otherwise, the FBI could decide to influence every election in America, and over time the FBI would pick the elected officials to their liking. 
Nothing can un-ring the bell that FBI Director Comey struck by letting loose his vague memo, but everyone can understand there is a sexist, partisan and blatant double standard at play by Republicans celebrating a vague memo, which only happened because an official sworn to be non-partisan decided he valued his political career more than the integrity of our electoral system.

Jason Chaffetz Just Got Hit With An Ethics Complaint For FBI Hillary Smear Campaign,"Comments 
The Democratic fury at FBI Director James Comey’s frustratingly decision to throw a wrench into election with his obviously partisan decision to reignite the “email” non-scandal keeps growing by the day. 
It’s becoming clear that Republican Congressmen, horrified at the way their candidate slides lower and lower in the polls, put undue pressure on Comey to give them an official, public, and entirely unnecessary “update” on the new emails that are – let’s reiterate – not to or from Hillary Clinton, are not related to her private email server, and were found on a cellphone belonging to Anthony Wiener, as part of a separate investigation into his illicit sexually-charged chats with a minor. 
In light of that, the Democratic Coalition Against Trump has filed an ethics complaint against Rep. Jason Chaffetz (R-UT) with the Office of Congressional Ethics: 
“Representative Chaffetz, in an ill-planned partisan attempt, released information that compromised the integrity of the FBI, when he irresponsibly tweeted out that the case investigating Secretary Clinton’s emails had been reopened, when in fact it had not been. 
Members of Congress are elected to make our country a safer, better place- not to use their power to work with leaders such as Comey in a partisan fashion. I hope that both are held accountable for their actions.” 
The complaint refers to this extremely misleading tweet, which fundamentally misrepresents what actually occurred. FBI Dir just informed me, “The FBI has learned of the existence of emails that appear to be pertinent to the investigation.” Case reopened 
— Jason Chaffetz (@jasoninthehouse) October 28, 2016 
Jason Chaffetz and the rest of the self-appointed inquisitors on the House Oversight Committee have wasted millions of dollars in taxpayer funds and Congressional time prosecuting fruitless investigations against the character of Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton. It’s high time we held them all accountable for abusing their power for undemocratic hit-jobs against their political opponents.",1
New Poll Just Confirmed Nobody Cares About Hillary’s Emails Except Trump Fans,"Comments 
After the reignition of the Hillary Clinton ’email scandal,” the polls indicate that 63% of Americans still don’t give a damn about Hillary Clinton’s emails. 
The House Republicans’ final gambit is the worst example of grasping at straws, and only days later yet the American people are signaling that yet another attempt to revive the Clinton email non-scandal has failed, miserably. 
Recent reports say 21 million early votes have already been cast in this year’s election, which represents roughly 1/6th of the total cast in the 2012 general election and none of those votes will be impacted by the FBI Director’s memo. 
Today, The Guardian reports that voters’ minds are already mostly made up about Clinton’s emails, and recent disclosures are having more impact among Republicans and other groups already not pre-disposed to vote for the Democratic nominee. 
“About a third of likely voters say they are less likely to support Clinton given FBI director James Comey’s disclosure,” said pollster Gary Langer . “Given other considerations, 63% say it makes no difference.” 
Many loyalists are convinced the latest trove of emails, discovered on equipment shared by Clinton aide Huma Abedin and her estranged husband Anthony Weiner, are an irrelevance. Even if some show more classified information passed its way through the private server, it should not change the FBI’s earlier decision that a criminal charge would be unfair without evidence of intent or coverup. But so long as this is not categorically established, there may be a nagging doubt in some minds that the FBI suspects otherwise. 
Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders destroyed the issue of Hillary Clinton’s emails early in the Democratic primary campaign, noting that they’re a giant pile of minutiae and that the American people are more concerned about economic fairness, trade policies and the corrosive effect of Citizens United on our politics. Famously, he said: 
Let me say something that may not be good politics, but the Secretary is right. People and America are sick and tired of hearing about your damn emails. 
The American people aren’t buying Trump’s lies about the FBI Director’s vague memo – written entirely without actual facts – signifies anything other than a DC game being played by House Republicans. Even CNN’s New Day plainly says at the start of this video plainly that, “Trump is Lying.” 
Republicans are in familiar territory after having run a divisive and needlessly incendiary political campaign this year, and stuck focusing on literally any little thing they can find about the Democratic nominee to distract voters from the real issues. 
It didn’t work during primary season and it’s not likely to work now.

BREAKING: FBI Director Comey Is Now Under Federal Investigation For Hillary Smear,"Comments 
It is almost certain that the United States Office Of Special Counsel (OSC) has opened an investigation into FBI Director James Comey over his questionable decision to reignite the Hillary Clinton email scandal just a week before the election. 
The OSC is a permanent independent federal investigative and prosecution agency that acts as an internal watchdog for federal employees. While the OSC refuses to confirm the truth, they always look in to inquiries. 
“It’s OSC’s longstanding policy not to confirm or deny the existence of an investigation In general, OSC opens a case after receiving a complaint.” The complaint was made by Richard Painter, a former White House ethics lawyer. 
“The F.B.I.’s job is to investigate, not to influence the outcome of an election. Such acts could also be prohibited under the Hatch Act, which bars the use of an official position to influence an election. That is why the F.B.I. presumably would keep those aspects of an investigation confidential until after the election” he wrote in the New York Times. 
If found guilty, OSC investigations usually lead to a rapid loss of employment. 
Director Comey certainly deserves to lose his job after throwing a wrench into the election, bowing to pressure from House Republicans and releasing an unnecessary and extremely misleading “update” on the new emails discovered in Anthony Weiner’s cellphone that have nothing to do Hillary Clinton, her email server, or the election at large – all the while refusing to release the results of their likely inquiries into Republican nominee Donald Trump’s relationship with Russian dictator Vladimir Putin.",1
CNBC Just Confirmed Comey Is Abusing His Power To Help Trump,"Comments 
A bombshell report from CNBC confirms that FBI Director James Comey had in fact concluded that the government of the Russian Federation was interfering with the election, but fought to keep that information from being released to the public because it was “too close to the election.” 
Instead, Comey prevented the name FBI from appearing on the statement the government ultimately made on October 7th. 
This attitude stands in stark contrast to the cavalier way in which Director Comey threw a wrench into the election by writing a letter to “update” Congress on the Hillary Clinton email investigation since the FBI discovered emails that “may” be pertinent to their previous inquiries. 
That announcement has drastically shifted the polling landscape of the election and given the Republican Party the final stretch ammunition that the Donald Trump campaign, sinking after weeks of sexual assault revelations, needed to bail themselves out and redirect the national narrative away from their own bad press. 
The hypocrisy is astounding; it appears that the Director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation attempted to hide the machinations by a foreign power to interfere in the elections of the United States to protect the Republican nominee, who has a long documented history with the operatives of said foreign power and a personally profitable reason to cultivate their support. 
The Director then said that he couldn’t release that information to the public – which definitely deserves to know if a foreign power is interfering with our electoral process – because it was “too close to the election” but then releases an intentionally vague and misleading letter concerning new emails that “may or may not be” pertinent to an investigation which the FBI itself had already exonerated Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton over? 
It’s obvious that Director Comey has joined Congressional Republicans in their efforts to conduct a witch-hunt against one of our nation’s most devoted public servants and usher in the election of a treasonous sexual predator instead.",1
Carville Just Unloaded On The Media For Allowing Comey To “Hijack Our Democracy”,"Comments 
Prominent Democratic figure James Carville is not letting Republicans get away with their overt attempt to hijack our democracy. Carville voiced his anger on MSNBC this Monday at the way FBI Director James Comey has reignited the investigation into candidate Clinton’s emails. 
“American democracy is really under attack here,” he said, pointing the finger at Comey and House Republicans. 
“We do know our that democracy is under assault, ” adding, “People have to decide, do we want our country for ourselves and the people in charge or do we want the KGB and the House Republicans to decide this election?” 
Anchor Thomas Roberts brought up the praising of Comey by Democrats back in July, but Comey stood firm in his stance, strongly urging Roberts, “Why are you defending this?” 
He continued, “Why are you sitting here when our democracy is under assault, when the FBI is acting at the behest of Jason Chaffetz, and sitting here acting like this is legit, it’s not. It’s an effort to effect this election. Democrats and people across this country have to know that,” he noted resoundingly. 
“When the facts change you change your mind,” he continued, regarding the change in the FBI from July to now. 
“You’re defending an assault on the American Democracy,” Carville fumed, adding that this is, “ An unprecedented event.” Carville again cautioned that our government is at risk at the hands of Comey, the GOP. 
As Carville so passionately advocated, we will not let the election and our democracy be squandered at the hands of these perpetrators.

Experts Just Uncovered The Top Secret Server Trump Uses To Talk To Russia,"Comments 
A private group of technical experts has reviewed meta-data about the Trump Organization’s internet usage and just concluded that the Republican nominee is using a personal email server to surreptitiously communicate from the Trump-email.com domain with a controversial Moscow-based bank, Alfa Bank. 
The timing of the Russian communications coincides perfectly with milestones throughout the election (see chart at bottom), and the very high level of secrecy deployed to hide them is going to be hard to explain away for the Trump campaign. 
Adding fuel to the building controversy, when researchers contacted Alfa Bank for comment, the Trump Organization quickly shut down the server: 
The Times hadn’t yet been in touch with the Trump campaign—Lichtblau spoke with the campaign a week later—but shortly after it reached out to Alfa, the Trump domain name in question seemed to suddenly stop working. 
The computer scientists believe there was one logical conclusion to be drawn: The Trump Organization shut down the server after Alfa was told that the Times might expose the connection. Weaver told me the Trump domain was “very sloppily removed.” Or as another of the researchers put it, it looked like “the knee was hit in Moscow, the leg kicked in New York.” 
But with their eyes watching, the Trump Organization casually re-connected with Alfa Bank only four days later, on a different server. All of this was captured in the Domain Name System (DNS), which is the internet’s internal directory system. DNS leaves log records all over saying how often website visits happen, and it’s the very same web services which was attacked last week , taking down Twitter, The New York Times and others. DNS is the system that routes our internet requests using names instead of numbers, and it keeps logs with IP address numbers and timestamps. 
In this case, the meta-data practically screams to experts, because it shows that there is little other traffic of any other kind by design. As we learned from Edward Snowden, the meta-data of a situation is incomplete, but it can tell you a lot. 
The new domain is owned by one of Trump’s hospitality marketing contract companies, which dispels Trump’s blown cover story that the private server is just used for marketing. 
Domain registration information also confirmed that the same marketing team works on both Trump-email.com and the new client-contact.com email addresses being used. Furthermore, the world-renowned technical expert Paul Vixie revealed that the Trump Organization went to extra-ordinary lengths to shut out all traffic that isn’t from Alfa Bank. 
There is a more sinister reason for creating a private email server that only participates in conversation with one specific party was identified by computing legend Paul Vixie: 
Earlier this month, the group of computer scientists passed the logs to Paul Vixie . In the world of DNS experts, there’s no higher authority. Vixie wrote central strands of the DNS code that makes the internet work. After studying the logs, he concluded, “The parties were communicating in a secretive fashion. The operative word is secretive . This is more akin to what criminal syndicates do if they are putting together a project.” 
Put differently, the logs suggested that Trump and Alfa had configured something like a digital hotline connecting the two entities, shutting out the rest of the world, and designed to obscure its own existence. Over the summer, the scientists observed the communications trail from a distance. 
Ironically, the academics and others started looking for foreign interference in order to protect both campaigns from outside meddling. It appears as if only one of the two campaigns conspired to that end: 
The computer scientists posited a logical hypothesis, which they set out to rigorously test: If the Russians were worming their way into the DNC, they might very well be attacking other entities central to the presidential campaign, including Donald Trump’s many servers. “We wanted to help defend both campaigns, because we wanted to preserve the integrity of the election,” says one of the academics, who works at a university that asked him not to speak with reporters because of the sensitive nature of his work. 
When researchers contacted Alfa Bank for comment, suddenly the Trump Organization shut down their email domain quickly. 
Four days later, the Trump Organization and Alfa Bank resumed communications – and it was the bank who contacted the Republican nominee’s company from Moscow, somehow knowing the new code to interact with the Trump private email server. 
This new information shows that after Trump asked Putin to hack America’s election to prejudice them against Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton in late July, traffic between the campaign and the Russian bank spiked. 
In the end, this is yet another matter that the FBI will surely have to investigate.. The question is: will they be fair and release the files from their inquiry in the kind of “act of radical transparency” that Director James Comey imposed on Hillary?",1
A “Veteran FBI Spy” Just Confirmed Trump’s Shocking Russian Ties,"Comments 
Republican Donald Trump has denied Russian business ties throughout his entire campaign for President, even after confirmed videos (below) show him bragging adamantly about his relationship with Russian President Vladimir Putin. 
However, Mother Jones just reported that Trump actually maintains a mutually beneficial, direct relationship with Putin, which is why the FBI has been conducting an inquiry into Trump’s campaign management since August. The entire report proves Trump’s Russian connection and was provided to the FBI in August by a “veteran spy”— and publicly revealed this afternoon . Here’s the conclusion: 
“Russian regime has been cultivating, supporting and assisting TRUMP for at least 5 years. Aim, endorsed by PUTIN, has been to encourage splits and divisions in western alliance.” It maintained that Trump “and his inner circle have accepted a regular flow of intelligence from the Kremlin, including on his Democratic and other political rivals.” It claimed that Russian intelligence had “compromised” Trump during his visits to Moscow and could “blackmail him.” It also reported that Russian intelligence had compiled a dossier on Hillary Clinton based on “bugged conversations she had on various visits to Russia and intercepted phone calls.” 
The former intelligence officer says the response from the FBI was “shock and horror.” The FBI, after receiving the first memo, did not immediately request additional material, according to the former intelligence officer and his American associates. Yet in August, they say, the FBI asked him for all information in his possession and for him to explain how the material had been gathered and to identify his sources. The former spy forwarded to the bureau several memos—some of which referred to members of Trump’s inner circle. After that point, he continued to share information with the FBI. “It’s quite clear there was or is a pretty substantial inquiry going on,” he says. 
“This is something of huge significance, way above party politics,” the former intelligence officer comments. “I think [Trump’s] own party should be aware of this stuff as well.” 
The above bombshell has been confirmed by the federal government. The western spy revealed that the Kremlin began working with Trump up to five years ago. 
Ultimately, this western spy went to the FBI due to the seriousness of the information that he had uncovered. 
A senior US government official not involved in this case but familiar with the former spy tells Mother Jones that he has been a credible source with a proven record of providing reliable, sensitive, and important information to the US government. 
A former senior intelligence officer for a Western country who specialized in Russian counterintelligence tells Mother Jones that in recent months he provided the bureau with memos, based on his recent interactions with Russian sources, contending the Russian government has for years tried to co-opt and assist Trump—and that the FBI requested more information from him. 
In June, the former Western intelligence officer—who spent almost two decades on Russian intelligence matters and who now works with a US firm that gathers information on Russia for corporate clients—was assigned the task of researching Trump’s dealings in Russia and elsewhere, according to the former spy and his associates in this American firm. This was for an opposition research project originally financed by a Republican client critical of the celebrity mogul. (Before the former spy was retained, the project’s financing switched to a client allied with Democrats.) “It started off as a fairly general inquiry,” says the former spook, who asks not to be identified. But when he dug into Trump, he notes, he came across troubling information indicating connections between Trump and the Russian government. According to his sources, he says, “there was an established exchange of information between the Trump campaign and the Kremlin of mutual benefit.” 
This was, the former spy remarks, “an extraordinary situation.” He regularly consults with US government agencies on Russian matters, and near the start of July on his own initiative—without the permission of the US company that hired him—he sent a report he had written for that firm to a contact at the FBI, according to the former intelligence officer and his American associates, who asked not to be identified. (He declines to identify the FBI contact.) The former spy says he concluded that the information he had collected on Trump was “sufficiently serious” to share with the FBI. 
This newest Mother Jones report is chilling news, implicating the Trump campaign in the kind of high level dirty politics that the Republican’s political hero Richard Nixon would’ve found awfully familiar –only with a bizarre Russian twist. Nixon resigned in disgrace after an investigation found evidence that he’d ordered a break-in to the Democratic National Committee’s offices at the Watergate Hotel seeking information to swing his election. Trump doesn’t look like he will get that opportunity, but might face just as much public scrutiny in the wake of election day due to his Russian ties. 
Donald Trump is the first American politician in history to openly beg Russia for help in an election, let alone in a presidential campaign. The Republican certainly has benefitted from a string of stolen email releases, which has strangely only afflicted Democrats — and not a single Republican.

FBI Just Announced It’s Looking Into The Trump Campaign’s Ties To Russia,"Comments 
It’s official. NBC is now reporting that Donald Trump’s campaign management has fallen under the scrutiny of an FBI inquiry, which is sure to blossom into a formal criminal investigation centered on Trump’s disgraced ex-manager Paul Manafort’s stewardship of the Republican campaign and his close ties to Ukraine. When he departed, Manafort was facing felony charges , and now the FBI’s suspicions have been confirmed by the evidence. 
New York Times f ound Ukrainian documents which outlined $12.7 million in previously unreported payments from a Ukrainian political party to Manafort, precipitating his departure from the campaign. 
The FBI has been conducting a preliminary inquiry into Donald Trump’s former campaign manager Paul Manafort’s foreign business connections, law enforcement and intelligence sources told NBC News Monday . Word of the inquiry, which has not blossomed into a full-blown criminal investigation, comes just days after FBI Director James Comey’s disclosure that his agency is examining a new batch of emails connected to an aide to Hillary Clinton. 
Trump has taken a series of pro-Russian positions that experts from both parties say are far outside the mainstream, and inexplicable from a political viewpoint. He continues to cast doubt on Russian involvement in election hacking, for example, despite the intelligence community’s public assessment. 
Just last night, we reported that Nevada Senator Harry Reid issued a statement alleging that the FBI had spoken of, “explosive information about close ties and coordination between Donald Trump, his top advisors, and the Russian government.” Maryland Congressman Elijah Cummings told CNN this morning that members of Congress in the Democratic minority have actively requested that the FBI look into the various news reports that Trump’s campaign, guided by Manafort, had drifted into Putin’s orbit. 
“Any specifics of what the FBI or intelligence agencies may be looking at are not something that the bureau should be discussing publicly.” ranking Democratic Congressman on the House Intelligence Committee Adam Schiff said, “But here, where the director has discussed an investigation involving one candidate, it opens the director up to claims of bias if he doesn’t discuss other potential investigations.” 
That’s right, in a misguided pursuit of fairness, the FBI Director may have just trashed decades of investigatory policy and been forced to disclose the existence of their active inquiry into the Trump campaign.",1
"A Pimp Just Revealed Trump Also Raped 12-Year-Old Girl, Threat To Kill Witnesses","Comments 
Republican nominee Donald Trump is an admitted serial sexual predator. His own recorded words confirm as much, as do the dozen or so women who have come forward to accuse him of sexual misconduct. His campaign is desperately fighting to put a lid on the growing awareness that Trump will be testifying under oath during a trial in federal court under the accusation of raping a thirteen-year-old girl and a previously undisclosed second girl, who was even younger . 
The case was thrown out in May due to a clerical error, but re-filed in June with two new witnesses –“Joan Doe” and “Tiffany Doe” who both say they worked as “party planners” for convicted child rapist and billionaire Jeffery Epstein. Part of that “planning” appears to have been procuring girls for the party, as “Joan Doe” revealed in her deposition that she convinced victim “Jane Doe” to attend four different parties with promises of money and “meeting contacts” in the modelling industry – a story that matches the account of another person who would arrange for underage women to attend Trump’s parties. 
At one of these parties, “Jane Doe” was forced to perform oral sex on Trump with a twelve-year old named “Maria.” At the fourth and final encounter, Tiffany Doe says “ I personally witnessed Defendant Trump telling the Plaintiff that she shouldn’t ever say anything if she didn’t want to disappear like the 12-year-old female Maria, and that he was capable of having her whole family killed.” 
“Maria” hadn’t been seen since the previous encounter. Trump then forcibly raped “Jane Doe,” who was then raped and sodomized again by Jeffery Epstein, who was apparently furious tha t Trump had ta ken her virginity and not him, beating her in his fury . 
Donald Trump told New York magazine in 2002 that “I’ve known Jeff for 15 years. Terrific guy. He’s a lot of fun to be with. It is even said that he likes beautiful women as much as I do, and many of them are on the younger side. No doubt about it — Jeffrey enjoys his social life.” 
Epstein’s brother, Mark, also testified that “Trump flew on Jeffrey’s private jet at least once and records indicate that Trump called Epstein twice in November of 2004.” 
Epstein eventually recieved a slap on the wrist – 13 months in prison and registration as a sex offender – for decades of abuse : 
“according to law-enforcement officials and alleged victims, between the years 1998 and 2007—and possibly even earlier—he ran a particularly vile pyramid scheme that involved paying minors around $200 at a time to perform sexual massages nearly every day and then recruit even younger girls to do the same. (“The more you do, the more you are paid,” one said.) During these massages, girls as young as 13 told police they were instructed to get undressed. Epstein would masturbate or penetrate them, they said—with his finger, or a vibrator, or his allegedly egg-shaped penis.” 
The details keep coming, and the picture they paint grows darker and more horrifying by they day. How much more evidence does America need? How many more stories need to be told before the word of one rich man is outweighed by literally dozens of contrasting accounts? Donald Trump is a sexual predator and a possible pedophile; he deserves a jail cell on Riker’s Island, not the White House.",1
A Republican Senator Just Told His Fans To Put A “Bulls-Eye” On Hillary’s Face,"Comments 
North Carolina Republican Senator Richard Burr was recorded not-so-subtly wishing that gun owners might shoot Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton in a despicable new tape that emerged on CNN. 
Burr is the Republican Chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee, a high title which seems inappropriate for a man of such small mind as to muse of the death of an American presidential candidate in a public place during a general election. CNN reports that : 
The North Carolina Republican, locked in a tight race for reelection [against Democrat Deborah Ross], quipped that as he walked into a gun shop “nothing made me feel better” than seeing a magazine about rifles “with a picture of Hillary Clinton on the front of it.” Sen. Richard Burr privately mused over the weekend that gun owners may want to put a “bullseye” on Hillary Clinton, according to audio obtained by CNN. 
“I was a little bit shocked at that — it didn’t have a bullseye on it,” he said Saturday to GOP volunteers, prompting laughter from the crowd in Mooresville, North Carolina. “But on the bottom right (of the magazine), it had everybody for federal office in this particular state that they should vote for. So let me assure you, there’s an army of support out there right now for our candidates.” 
The comments resemble similar ones made by Donald Trump in August when the GOP nominee said “Second Amendment people” could take matters into their own hands if Clinton became president. 
Senator Burr also mentioned how proud he was to have crippled the effectiveness of the Supreme Court by delaying President Obama’s appointment of Merrick Garland which itself has set a record for longest time after such an appointment without a hearing. 
In the same talk, Burr bragged that he’d support keeping the court in a state of permanent dysfunction by refusing any of Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton’s judicial appointments, including to the Supreme Court. 
It’s fast becoming apparent that Republicans merely used that piece of double-talk as the start of an existential attack on American-style democracy, which requires a reasonable opposition to cooperate and compromise in decisions for a functioning government for the betterment of the people. 
Double talk from Republican Congressmen of this type has become all too commonplace, but with Senator Burr’s lies to North Carolina voters, it’s so bold that he even gave opposite quotations to local reporters versus those inside the beltway and thought he could get away with it. 
Burr both publicly distanced himself from Trump and at the very same time doubled down on supporting Trump after his tapes emerged revealing the Republican nominee’s serial predilection for sex assault. 
Now that Richard Burr’s deplorable tape has emerged, the Republican Senator is facing calls to resign his position in the Senate altogether. 
Unlike Trump, the North Carolina Republican has already issued an apology, but it remains to be seen whether that will have any saving grace for the vulnerable Republican, who is locked in a death heat with Democrat challenger Deborah Ross . 
It is absolutely unacceptable that an elected member of the United States Senate would even make jokes about the political assassination of one of our nation’s most dedicated public servants",1
Trump Just Got Hit With Massive $32 Million Fraud & Tax Evasion Lawsuit,"Comments 
Republican nominee and lawsuit magnet Donald Trump has found himself the target of yet another accusation of fraud and financial misconduct – this time in another country. A Mexican official has filed a criminal tax complaint against Trump in Tijuana, Mexico, over yet another failed business venture – the Trump Ocean Resort, which collapsed before it even began construction. 
But before the housing market and the rest of the global economy collapsed with the onset of the Bush Recession, Trump and his partners sold $32.5 million in future properties to unwitting customers since 2006 and leaving their investors in the lurch. 
In addition, Donald Trump is accused of dodging an additional $32.5 million in taxes – surprise! – but has countered that he wasn’t actually involved, but that he was just “leasing” his name on the project. The investors, however, counter that Trump’s face was on the brochure and quoted him as saying it would be “the most spectacular place in all of Mexico.” 
Though Trump worked out the deal with Los Angeles-based developer Irongate Wilshire and Mexican company P.B. Impulsores, the lawsuit singles out Trump by name, calling him out “against the Mexican state because beyond defrauding investors he also committed fraud by not paying taxes in Mexico for the mercantile operations he took part in.”",1
Libertarian Candidate To MSNBC: “I’m Here Vouching for Mrs. Clinton.”,"Comments

Weld served as the Republican Governor of the very blue state of Massachusetts, and has a reputation as a serious public servant of stellar reputation. He said: 
“I’m here vouching for Mrs. Clinton, and I think it’s high time somebody did, and I’m doing it based on my personal experience with her. I think that she deserves to have people vouch for her other than members of the Democratic National Committee.” 
As Rachel Maddow says, it’s not quite an endorsement, but coming from Weld, it’s meaningful personal affirmation of the Democratic nominee’s character and fitness for office from a politician outside her party. We’re sure that the Libertarian presidential candidate Gary Johnson will put out yet another statement denying what you can plainly see in the video below.

Trump Panics As 28% of Florida GOP Early Votes go to HILLARY (VIDEO),"Comments 
The Last Word with Lawrence O’Donnell on MSNBC just aired a unique new poll must already have the Trump campaign reeling. O’donell reports that over a quarter of the state of Florida’s registered Republicans tell this that they’ve already voted early for Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton. It’s actually the first poll that includes only actual early voters, surveyed by William and Mary College and TargetSmart. This new poll also shows that Hillary Clinton leads Florida 48-40 which TargetSmart says, “challenges conventional wisdom.” That’s not even the most shocking result… 
“ Hillary Clinton is winning 28% of registered Republicans ,” said TargetSmart CEO Tom Bonier, “ who have already voted already .” According to their surveys of early voters, Hillary Clinton has won 53% percent of early votes cast thus far in the 2016 election, and there’s more data in the video below. 28% of Florida early voting Republicans have voted for @HillaryClinton 
— Lawrence O'Donnell (@Lawrence) November 2, 2016 
“This includes absentee ballot voters who tend to trend more Republican and 28% of those voters are crossing over, when we look at Democrats,” said TargetSmart’s Bonier, “there’s almost no crossing over. Trump has only won 6% of those voters. Yes. These are people that have already voted, and these Republicans are not just saying it to pollsters, but they’re doing it in Florida. These are voters that are not waiting for election day.” 
If this poll result holds up, there’s absolutely no path to victory for the Republican campaign, as there is literally no likely scenario resulting in electoral victory for Trump when he loses Florida to Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton.

The YMCA Just Offered Free Election Day Childcare So Everyone Can Vote,"Comments 
In exactly one week from today, millions of Americans will join a mass exodus to various polling places around the nation to select new city and state officials, mayors, judges, sheriffs, congressional representatives, and of course the next President of the United States. 
However, some find themselves locked out of the process not from a lack of desire to participate, but because they have responsibilities as parents and can not find the time, or the resources, to leave their offspring alone so that they may go to the ballot box. 
With lines at some polling stations reaching up to 5 to 8 hours during the primary a few months ago, in Arizona for example, voting can be rightly seen as out of reach for those who have more to do than stand around chewing the fat with their neighbors while they wait for their turn to pull a lever. 
The YMCA has offered to do their part to help alleviate some of this inconvenience by offering free child car services on election day. The USA President and CEO of the YMCA, Kevin Washington, issued this decree : 
“Election Day is arguably one of the most important days in the U.S. this year — the ultimate opportunity for Americans to make their voices heard through the democratic process. Unfortunately, many people who want to vote find it challenging because they have to take children with them. The Y’s hope is that Zoe’s Kids Day Out initiative enables those parents and caregivers to exercise their right to vote, and ensures children can spend their time in a safe, nurturing environment. 
Now not every single YMCA location across the nation is offering this fantastic service, so please be sure to check with your local chapter beforehand. 
While the YMCA deserves applause and recognition for their commitment to furthering American democracy through inclusion, what they are offering is a band-aid to a systemic problem. 
To correct this issue entirely the American people deserve election day to be a national holiday. Sen. Bernie Sanders (D-VT) proposed a bill to create “Democracy Day” which would codify into law the right for all Americans to have a day off to vote. Presently there are no legal requirements for employers to give their employees time off to vote, although hundreds of large corporations have voluntarily allowed their workers time to vote without fear of penalty or repercussion, but this is not enough. 
Only around 54% of eligible voters turned out to polling places in 2012, and that cannot be entirely blamed on voter apathy, but also on the reality that many do not have the time or resources to cast a ballot despite their deep desire to do participate in the democratic process. The American people deserve better, and our government must do more to ensure that everyone who wishes to vote has the ability to do exactly that.",1
Fact Check: Democrats Have Created Twice As Many Jobs As Republicans Since 1950’s,"Comments 
Democrats are better for the economy. This statement is not an opinion, but a fact. According to economist Steven Stoft, who created a series of graphs charting job creation under each party over the last 72 years (during which time Democrats and Republicans have held control for 36 years each), Democrats have created 58 million jobs while Republicans can only claim 26 million . 
For roughly the last century, electing a Democrat has been the better option for the economy, with Dems creating more than double the jobs than that of Republicans, and faster. 
Even when taking the percent change of number of jobs held, or scaling population (to avoid counting an increased population, thus falsely indicating an increase in jobs), Democrats still prove more successful than Republicans in job creation, and by a wide margin. 
Another way of studying job creation is to take unemployment into account. When a Democrat is in the White House, logically unemployment decreases as well. By this rational, of course, when a GOP takes the Oval Office unemployment rises (and has risen under this party) since 1945. 
Indeed, this extends to state and federal levels—the top 20 years of national GDP growth have all been under a Democrat. This is not only true for GDP, but for all economic growth in general—extending to the stock market, income growth and debt as a percentage of GDP. 
As if you needed more proof that the blue party is better for the economy, simply turn to the numbers over the last 70 years. When it comes time for Election Day, it’s a matter of fact that with every Democratic ballot cast, it’s almost guaranteed the country will be in a better economic position than if a Republican is sworn in.",1
Cher Just Destroyed Fake Republican Outrage Over Hillary’s Emails With One Tweet,"World-famous singer Cherilyn “Cher” Sarkisian took to Twitter recently to give her two cents on the re-ignition of the email scandal Republican witch-hunt of Hillary Clinton. 
FBI director James Comey bowed to pressure from House Republicans and released a letter informing them of “updates” to the investigation, which was the discovery of emails on disgraced Democratic Congressman Anthony Weiner’s personal email devices that were not from or to former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton. 
Cher vented the frustration that many of us are feeling in this tweet: TIRED OF BULLOUTRAGE‼️ GW BUSH’‘S W.H DID TRASH 22 MILLION FKNG EMAILS‼️HIS WARS KILLED &MAIMED THOUSANDS ,& HE &BANKRUPTED ANSWER THAT 
— Cher (@cher) October 29, 2016 
The George Bush White House launched two multinational invasions and orchestrated the construction of secret detention centers around the world for the specific intention of committing crimes against humanity – but nobody seems to care about the information that might have been contained in THOSE emails. 
The double standard that is applied to Hillary Clinton is outrageous. George W. Bush and Dick Cheney, both war criminals, walk free while the nation obsesses over John Podesta’s risotto recipe and a rabble-rousing Russophile rapist draws closer to the White House. Where have our priorities gone?",1
A Federal Judge Just Ordered The RNC To Reveal Its Voter Fraud Pact With Trump,"Comments 
Federal Judge John Michael Vazquez set a court appearance for this Thursday for the Democratic National Committee’s emergency legal action to fight Republican minority suppression efforts. 
The DNC filed suit over a generation-old consent decree last week seeking an injunction and extension of the order by eight years, which prevents illegal Republican voter suppression “ballot security” measures. 
That lawsuit is looking ever more likely to succeed, resulting in an order barring Republicans across the country from targeting minority voters. The RNC’s response pointedly omitted any defense of the Michigan and Pennsylvania RNC members accused of unlawful ballot security programs, who are the two key players in this courtroom drama that also involves VP candidate Mike Pence and Trump campaign manager Kellyanne Conway. 
The federal judge ordered both Michigan GOP Chairwoman Ronna Romney McDonald – Mitt Romney’s niece – and Pennsylvania GOP Chairman Rob Gleason to submit sworn statements along with documentation of their ballot security programs by 5pm today. 
Last night, Republican lawyers tossed the two high-ranking RNC members under the bus by failing entirely to defend their actions, sworn accounts of which are due at 5pm today. The Democrat’s strongest claims are against the two national RNC members who spoke to the media about ballot security programs. 
The Washington Post wrote about the Pennsylvania GOP’s plans to flood urban Philadelphia with suburban poll watchers from other counties and a legal effort to remove state law restrictions on out of county ballot watchers, while t he Michigan State GOP Chairwoman was quoted in The Detroit Free Press as saying she was directing measures in Michigan to launch a “massive anti-fraud” effort. 
Under the 1982 agreement between the parties as it’s been modified through the years, any “ballot security program” must be submitted to the court and DNC for “preclearance” ten days before being implemented. It seems highly unlikely that the DNC was notified of any of the four major activities the court demanded to be explained. 
The Republican National Committee also has until 5pm today to deliver statements about minority voter suppression made in public, video recorded comments by VP nominee Mike Pence and media reports about the Trump campaign manager Kellyanne Conway’s statements after the third and final debate. Additionally, the national Republican party has got to deliver to the court any and all agreements between the RNC and the Trump campaign that involve electioneering or polling places to the court as well. 
The Democratic lawyers even submitted fresh evidence to the court that the RNC is involved nationally in poll security operations, which a former federal prosecutor obtained via text message during the normal course of poll watching activities. The RNC denies activity in any and all poll watching venues in their legal filings. 
The Republican National Committee is clearly frustrated by its lengthy tenure under the key voter protection legal agreement, and you can tell from the legal filing that it wants out. However, the Republican party of Trump isn’t playing by the rules, like it’s standard bearer doesn’t play by the rules, and now they’re likely going to be punished. 
Tonight, the music stops and the Republicans will finally have to answer for their dirty campaign tactics, or face the wrath of a federal judge. 
Here’s the judge’s complete order:",1
Trump’s Child Rape Victim Just Canceled Press Conference Over Death Threats,"Comments 
The woman accusing Trump of raping her when she was just thirteen years old at one of convicted pedophile Jeffery Epstein’s notorious underage sex parties was all set to come forward tonight to tell her story – but backed out at the last moment, saying that she had “received threats” and feared for her life. Lisa Bloom just said her client was “living in fear” and did not want to show her face and ended the press conference. 
— Christopher Hayes (@chrislhayes) November 2, 2016 
The pressures that face the female accusers of powerful white men couldn’t be more clear right now. One of Trump’s sexual assault accusers has already fled the country due to threats from his rabid supporters.“ We feel the backlash of the Trump supporters. It scares us. It intimidates us. We are in fear of our lives,” said Mindy McGillivray, who said Trump groped her at a party. “I look out the window and there are cars just driving around the house and looking, slowing down right at the house. I don’t live in a gated community. This is dangerous. There could be people out there who want to hurt us.’’ 
The pressure to stay silent comes just as strong from the Trump camp itself – just look at how Michael Cohen, special counsel for the Trump Organization, responded to Daily Beast when they called asking for comment on a story about how Trump raped then-wife Ivana Trump in a painful and brutal fashion: 
I will make sure that you and I meet one day while we’re in the courthouse. And I will take you for every penny you still don’t have. And I will come after your Daily Beast and everybody else that you possibly know. So I’m warning you, tread very fucking lightly, because what I’m going to do to you is going to be fucking disgusting. You understand me?” 
“You write a story that has Mr. Trump’s name in it, with the word ‘rape,’ and I’m going to mess your life up… for as long as you’re on this frickin’ planet… you’re going to have judgments against you, so much money, you’ll never know how to get out from underneath it.’ 
Which begs the question, why so defensive if there is nothing to hide, Mr. Trump? 
Donald Trump’s followers are some of the lowest, most hateful scum to ever tarnish American soil. Klansmen, neo-Nazis, white supremacists. They send death threats to anyone who dares to speak out against him – if you’re lucky. You could receive horrifying, personalized attacks like a Jewish writer for the National Review did: 
Given the ease with which Trump supporters will bring violence on the innocent , it is no wonder that these women are reluctant to come forward. This is the culture of fear that Donald Trump has created – and one which will consume our whole nation if we somehow let him become President.

Weiner’s Teen Victim Just Called Out Comey For Politicizing Her Abuse,"Comments 
The teenager whose explosive allegations led to a federal investigation against disgraced former Congressman Anthony Weiner has published an open letter about victim’s rights, and her utter betrayal by FBI Director James Comey’s partisan memo that is so heart wrenching, that it must be shared and read by every single law enforcement officer in the country, if not the world. 
This entire weekend, intense media coverage has focused on one woman – Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton – most observers believe was wronged by Comey’s intentionally vague memo. All the while, the woman most harmed by FBI Director Comey’s partisan attack has been suffering in silent agony, victimized first by her abuser and then by the men with badges. 
FBI agents claimed that they spoke with her to seek justice, only for Comey to turn around and betray her, to victimize her yet again, by thrusting her story into the white heat of the last week in a bitterly contested general election campaign’s final media feeding frenzy with one vaguely worded memo guaranteed to draw maximum questioning by the press. 
The anonymous teen who only went to the FBI under the promise of anonymity and was grilled by agents for seven hours just last Friday. Only minutes after ending that interrogation, she was contacted by journalists who knew her identity only minutes after ending the discussions with the federal law enforcement officers. 
Clearly, her identity was somehow no longer a secret. The media contacted the teen victim and her family before even the FBI case manager let her know about Comey’s memo, and it all happened before she could escape the public eye to safeguard her privacy. So she wrote this letter and delivered it to a national entertainment website : 
I am the 15-year-old (now 16) who was the victim of Anthony Weiner. I now add you to the list of people who have victimized me. I told my story originally to protect other young girls that might be a victim of online predators. 
Your letter to Congress has now brought this whole matter back into the media spotlight. Not even 10 minutes after being forensically interviewed with the FBI for seven hours, I received a phone call from a REPORTER asking for a statement. Why didn’t you communicate with the local FBI agents that I had just spoken to? They could have scheduled our interview sooner or scheduled a time to interview me later, or change locations of the interview. My neighborhood has been canvassed by reporters asking for details about me. 
In your letter, you chose to use a vague approach, meaning the media had to keep searching to try and find out what evidence you had uncovered and how. Every media outlet from local to national has contacted me and my family to get my “story.” Why couldn’t your letter have waited until after the election, so I would not have to be the center of attention the last week of the election cycle? 
In his “cooperation” with you and with his love of the spotlight, Anthony Weiner has given information that led to the media finding me. You have assisted him in further victimizing me on every news outlet. I can only assume that you saw an opportunity for political propaganda. 
I thought your job as FBI Director was to protect me. I thought if I cooperated with your investigation, my identity as a minor would be kept secret. That is no longer the case. My family and I are barraged by reporters’ phone calls and emails. I have been even been blamed in a newspaper for causing Donald Trump to now be leading in some polls and costing Hillary the election. 
Anthony Weiner is the abuser. Your letter helped that abuse to continue. How can I rebuild my life when you have made finding out my “story” the goal of every reporter? When I meet with my therapist next time, she will already know what we are going to talk about before I get there by reading Friday, October 28th, 2016’s New York Times article. 
I may have been Weiner’s victim, but the real story here is that I am a survivor. I am strong, intelligent, and certain that I will come out from under this nightmare, but it will not be as a result of your doing your job to protect me. I hope that by making my letter to you public, you will think about how your actions affect the victims of the crimes you are investigating. The election is important, yes, but what happened to me and how it makes me feel and how others see me, is much more important. It’s time that the FBI Director puts his victims’ rights above political views. 
— Girl that lost her faith in America 
P.S. To all reporters: AP, FOX, CBS, NBC, and all other media outlets, please respect my position and stop interrupting my life! 
It’s impossible to read this letter without tears for the teenage girl who was victimized by Anthony Wiener, and bravely stepped forward to alert the authorities so they could stop a sad sex predator so mentally ill, that after his out of control actions cost him his career and his public image, he continued his behavior until he lost his marriage and perhaps next his freedom for the safety of others. 
Instead, the very authorities at the FBI who pledged to maintain her anonymity and seek justice for her, and to prevent she, and others from facing the same ills, have turned into a political party with badges – and not a very well coordinated group of people with badges either. 
Our nation needs leaders who place their duty above partisan politics, and in law enforcement we need cops on the beat to protect the victims, not to abuse the victims for their own partisan games. 
Our nation needs for FBI Director James Comey to admit his mistakes and vacate his position, before the next victim of crime gets victimized by his unsavory political maneuvering using the country’s top law enforcement agency to slander someone else into political compliance.",1
Putin’s Pro-Trump Online Trolls Just Spilled The Beans To Samantha Bee,"Comments 
The conservative political machine has been working overtime to try to deny that the government of the Russian Federation is interfering with the American election in support of Republican nominee Donald Trump – but this explosive investigation by former Daily Show correspondent Samantha Bee proves once and for all that dictator Vladimir Putin is using every tool at his disposal to tilt the scale in favor of Trump. 
Samantha Bee, now the host of her own show, traveled to Moscow to interview two of the “thinkfluencers,” members of Putin’s underground troll farms that pose as Americans online and flood social media with pro-Russian and pro-Trump propaganda. 
“The reason I’m hired is to make simple people change their mind about their vote and also about Russia” said one woman, who admitted she identifies herself as a Nebraskan housewife online. When asked why they thought their propaganda was working, she replied it was because Americans are “lazy and they believe everything they read.”",1
Here’s Proof That The Iowa Cop Killer Is A Trump Supporter,"Comments 
Many people have been wondering whether or not a white man known for waving Confederate flags at black teenagers and just murdered two cops is a Trump supporter. 
Grant Rodgers, a journalist for the Des Moines Register , did some investigating and found some pretty undeniable evidence that yes, Michael Greene Scott supported the Republican nominee for President. 
The house is Greene’s last listed address, which he shares with his mother. 
Greene turned himself into earlier today and is in custody after allegedly firing thirty or more shots into a parked patrol car, killing two police officers in Des Moines, Iowa. It is the second act of domestic terrorism to take place in the United States in the past day, coming just two hours after Trump supporters in Mississippi set a historically African-American church on fire and spray-painted “VOTE TRUMP” on it. 
Donald Trump has begun a movement, indeed – a movement of hatred and violence that has now lead to multiple deaths, thousands of dollars in property damage, and unquantifiable emotional trauma across the nation as Latinos, blacks, Muslims, and sexual assault survivors are forced to bear the brunt of the gaslit firestorm that Trump ignites with his bullying and his dog-whistles. 
As we draw closer to election day, these kinds of incidents are going to increase in frequency – and god only knows what will happen when he loses.",1
Obama Just Blasted FBI Director For Smearing Hillary To Help Trump,"President Obama weighed in on the right-wing efforts to revive the Hillary Clinton “email scandal” witch hunt by publicly chastising his own appointed FBI Director, James Comey, for the FBI’s unnecessary decision to inform Congress that they had found new emails that may be “pertinent.” 
The President reiterated his determination to not be seen as “meddling” in the case , but rightfully criticized Comey for stirring up undue controversy over pure speculation on emails that were neither sent nor received by then-Secretary of State Hillary Clinton. 
“Setting aside the particulars of this case, I know that [Hillary Clinton] is somebody who has always looked out for the interests of America and the American people first, and I do think that there is a norm that when there are investigations, we don’t operate on innuendo, we don’t operate on incomplete information, we don’t operate on leaks, we operate based on concrete decisions that are made. 
When this was investigated thoroughly the last time, the conclusion of the FBI, the conclusion of the Justice Department, the conclusion of repeated congressional investigations was that, you know, she had made some mistakes, but that there wasn’t anything there that was, you know, prosecutable.” 
The president hit the nail right on the head. This “investigation” is over and done with; for Comey to throw fuel on the fire of right-wing paranoia this close to the election cannot be seen as anything but a partisan effort to derail the campaign of Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton, especially after it became clear that Comey tried to suppress news of the investigation into Republican nominee Donald Trump’s ties to the Russian Federation – a much more serious and potentially seditious allegation.

Trump Campaign Was Just Ordered To Appear In Court For Voter Intimidation,"Comments 
A federal judge in Nevada just dragged the Trump campaign into court to answer for accusations of using minority voter intimidation tactics alongside the RNC. This case is on similar grounds as the national suit, and accuses the Nevada state GOP of violating the surviving provisions of the Ku Klux Klan Act of 1871, seeking to deprive American citizens of their civil rights, in this case, the right to vote. 
A federal judge Tuesday ordered representatives from the Donald Trump campaign and the Nevada Republican Party to appear at a hearing in his courtroom Wednesday afternoon in a lawsuit filed by Nevada Democrats accusing them of the engaging in voter intimidation tactics. U.S. District Judge Richard Franklin Boulware also ordered the Trump campaign and state party to turn over any training materials they provided to “poll watchers, poll observers, exit pollsters or any other similarly tasked individuals.” 
At the hearing, the Trump campaign and the Nevada GOP should be prepared to respond to the motion for a temporary restraining order that the Democrats requested in the lawsuit, the judge’s order said. 
In other new, there was an order issued in the national voter intimidation case against the RNC that we’ve been following. A federal judge just ordered the Republican National Committee to turn over their entire geographic targeting plan for poll watching after Democrats filed a lawsuit last week under a 35-year old binding legal agreement to prevent minority voter suppression by the GOP. 
At a court hearing this morning, top RNC officials were ordered to testify under oath and reveal all knowledge about poll watching or observation programs to be enacted by RNC volunteers. 
Trump’s campaign manager, Republican VP candidate Mike Pence, two GOP state party chairs, and longtime wingnut Trump operative Roger Stone all stand accused of violating the agreement by instituting or speaking about illegal “ballot security programs” in recordings and to the media. 
Republicans “ballot security” ideas need to be pre-cleared 10 days in advance by Democrats and the federal court according to the 1982 agreement, and nowhere have GOP lawyers asserted that they asked for such clearance to date. Judge John Michael Vazquez ordered : 
ORDERED that Defendant [Republican National Committee] shall also produce to Plaintiff [Democratic National Committee] no later than 5:00 p.m. EST, November 3, 2016, and file on the docket the following: An affidavit or affidavits by a person or persons with personal knowledge setting forth in detail Defendant’s efforts regarding poll watching or poll observation’ in connection with the 2016 Presidential Election. 
Defendant’s efforts shall apply to those efforts by any employee, agent, or servant of Defendant, including volunteers and independent contractors/vendors. The affiant(s) shall be an agent, servant, or employee of Defendant. The affidavit(s) shall set forth all material terms of any such efforts, including any geographic areas which are being targeted for poll watching or poll observation and the reason(s) those areas are being targeted . Any training materials or advice, whether written, electronic, or verbal, provided to poll watchers or poll observers shall also be provided. 
Democrats have requested injunctive relief from the court to stop Republicans from flooding polls in minority areas with “poll watchers” seeking to prevent, challenge or intimidate voters from casting their votes, rather than ensuring the rights of voters to make their choices. 
Just yesterday, another long list of court ordered disclosures was made public, and it included the Republican party’s response to the Democrats stiff demands for sanctions and contempt of court against the Republican party’s violators. 
In the GOP’s response they notably failed to defend the Pennsylvania state GOP chair (who is also a member of the RNC and therefore fully bound by the agreement), who disclosed that he was trying to change state law to allow voters from suburban counties around Philadelphia to flood into polling places in the urban areas where there’s a majority of minority voters. 
Oral arguments in the case are happening tomorrow, and it’s expected that the court will issue a decision in the case. 
Oddly, Republicans are facing these numerous lawsuits because they “won” a court battle over the 1982 consent decree which prevents them from intimidating minority voters, that forced Democrats to sue for state party activities separately from the national party, even though many of those activities are the same and all of the top state party officials are part of the RNC themselves. 
Now, there are three other states where the Republican state parties are facing legal action by Democrats for ballot security programs, which might violate both the aforementioned Ku Klux Klan Act or the Voting Rights Act or both.",1
Iowa Cop Killer Was Mad At Police For Not Arresting Black Teens Who Sat During Anthem,"Comments 
Special to Occupy Democrats by Carlos Miller of PINAC News. 
It was only last month that Scott Michael Greene accused a group of black teenagers of being “cop haters” because they did not stand for the National Anthem during a high school football game. This morning, he shot and killed two cops in cold blood as they sat in their patrol cars. Greene, 46, was arrested a few hours later after an intense manhunt. 
Below is a video he posted on YouTube, along with a screenshot of his comment referring to the black teens as cop haters for not standing during the national anthem at high school game, which caused him to throw a fit of rage leading to him eventually being kicked out of the stadium. 
He was angry at police after they had kicked him out of the football game for waving a Confederate flag in front of a group of black students in Urbandale on October 14, 2016. Two days later, he posted the infamous video to YouTube from the encounter titled, “Police Abuse, Civil Rights Violation at Urbandale High School 10/14/16.” 
Of course, neither Trump nor his campaign have said anything about the killings except a tweet offering the old tired “thoughts and prayers.” 
In the video, he tries to explain to the cops kicking him out that he was doing nothing more than expressing his First Amendment rights to wave the Confederate flag. He also said he was assaulted and had his flag stolen from him. However, police said he was causing a disturbance and that he would be arrested for trespassing on school property if he did not leave. They also returned his flag to him. 
While they agreed he had a Constitutional right to wave the flag, they informed him that on school grounds, he was subject to school policies that did not allow the waving of the Confederate flag. Less than a week ago, he stated in the comments section of his video that he was “offended by the blacks sitting through our anthem” and referred to them as being “cop haters.” Now, he is a suspected cop killer. Greene has a long history of arrests, including one incident where he threatened to kill a black man after calling him a racial slur. He also went though mental evaluation and was placed on medication. 
According to the Des Moines Register: 
He was charged with a simple misdemeanor count of interference with official acts on April 10, 2014, when he resisted an attempt by officers to pat him down for weapons at an Urbandale residence on Colby Parkway, according to a criminal complaint. The officers wanted to search Greene after noticing that he had a pouch on his belt that resembled a holster. 
Greene was “noncompliant, hostile, combative and made furtive movements toward his pockets” before the arrest, Officer Chris Greenfield wrote in the complaint. Greene pleaded guilty to the charge about two weeks later. 
The complaint does not indicate why officers initially came into contact with Greene. But two days later he reportedly threatened to kill a man in the parking lot of the same apartment complex and he was charged with first-degree harassment, according to another complaint. 
In that incident, Greene was accused of approaching a man in the parking lot and shined a flashlight in his eyes. Greene, who lived in the apartments, called the man the N-word and told the man “I will kill you, (expletive) kill you,” according to the complaint. Greene pleaded guilty to a lesser harassment charge on June 30, 2014, and was sentenced to one year of probation. 
In a discharge report filed in June 2015 a probation officer wrote that Greene had received a mental health evaluation and “reports to have complied with the medication recommendations.”

A Black Church Was Just Burned And Spray-Painted “Vote Trump”,"Comments 
Tensions are mounting as the most viciously divisive election in our nation’s history draws closer, and it is truly bringing out the worst in the American people. An African-American church in Mississippi, the Hopewell M.B. Church in Greeneville , has been set ablaze, causing heavy damage to the building – and in case there was any mystery as to who was responsible, “VOTE TRUMP” was spray-painted on the side. 
For all their talk about “religious freedom,” conservative Trump fans sure does have a fondness for attacking religious institutions. Mosques have been torched around the country in response to terrorist attacks , collectively punishing members of an entire religion for crimes committed by mentally disturbed individuals. 
Black churches have also been torched throughout the South as white supremacists and neo-Nazis come out of the wood-work, emboldened by Trump’s racial dogwhistles and ethno-nationalist rabble-rousing. The worst of these targeted attacks came last summer when a white supremacist walked into the Emanuel AME Church in Charleston, S.C, and murdered nine peaceful worshippers. 
This is the second act of domestic terrorism committed in the United States today, coming just hours before a white man murdered two police officers in Iowa, and as Trump continues to rile up his base and perpetuate the delusions of a conspiracy against him, it’s not likely to be the last.",1

Trump Wrote A Book About Sexually Assaulting Women And Casual Racism,"Comments 
As it happens Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump has written a book other than “The Art Of The Deal” and in true Trumponian fashion, it is a fiction novel titled “ Trump Tower “that should more likely be classified as smut. 
Trump described the book as “ The sexist novel of the decade” and was originally billed as, “ The debut novel from ‘New York Times’-bestselling author, international business mogul, television superstar, and New York City icon, Donald J. Trump.” 
“Trump Tower” was a magnificent flop and Trump, staying true to his penchant for not admitting obvious failure, removed his name from the book in its second iteration and gave all credit to ghostwriter Jeffrey Robinson. However, as Trump is now to learn, once something is on the Internet it is on their forever — even if you are a not-yet-convicted sexually predatory offender with money. Below is the original listing with the U.S. ISBN agency: Jeffrey Robinson’s #TrumpTower has it all. The ultra rich, powerful, and beautiful. It’s your summer must-read http://t.co/lQKvIzzV 
— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) August 13, 2012 
In delving into the story, which appears to have been written for those with the reading comprehension of a first grader in mind, it routinely degrades women. The opening chapter speaks of a tenant who is bound and gagged to a bed naked only to be found by one of the tower’s staff: 
There she was, completely naked and gagged, her arms above her head, handcuffed to the top of the bedstead, with her legs tied to the bed and stretched wide apart. 
That sounds icily similar to the rape accusations being levied against Trump, no? The official court documents filed against Trump state : 
Defendant Trump tied Plaintiff to a bed, exposed himself to Plaintiff, and then proceeded to forcibly rape Plaintiff. During the course of this savage sexual attack, Plaintiff loudly pleaded with Defendant Trump to stop but with no effect. Defendant Trump responded to Plaintiff’s pleas by violently striking Plaintiff in the face with his open hand and screaming that he would do whatever he wanted. 
The other gems of literary genius included: 
“Take off your sweatshirt,” he said again. Her hands were trembling. “No.” “Yes,” he said. “Take off your sweatshirt. She reached for the bottom of her sweatshirt, but all she could do was hold onto it. “No.” “Yes.” “I can’t.” “Yes you can. Do as I tell you. Take off your sweatshirt.” She tried to swallow, but her mouth was totally dry. “I can’t…” “Do it. Take off your sweatshirt. Do as I tell you.” She closed her eyes, hesitated, then pulled off her sweatshirt. 
And: 
“I’d probably like his mama’s titties, too,” and, instead of using his key, he rang the bell. 
On top of the sordid sexual scenarios in Trump’s book, there are disrespectful racial references: 
Come on, you’re a shoo-in.” He reminded her, “Two white guys and a great-looking minority girl with perfect boobs? No contest.” 
Apparently Trump was too cheap to hire an editor as the book is riddled with grammatical errors such as, “In fact, none of the apartments in the tower was numbered.” 
In his quest for attention Trump attempted on numerous occasions to have his clap trap babble transitioned to television. The book had been in the works since the late 90s and according to Bob Frederick, who represents MVP Entertainment, “We hired a writer out of Los Angeles and developed a pilot with Showtime. And Donald was happy with it.” 
More than a decade later in 2008 Trump pitched the story to Lifetime which presented its own disgusting irony. The likely soon-to-be-convicted sexual predator wanted his story on a network known for producing shows about sexual predators. 
Trump’s co-author, Mr. Robinson, has refused to comment on the book. However, if one were so inclined they are able to read the first few chapters for free on Amazon’s kindle version , using the preview option. That is all one should read for two reasons. The first is purchasing the book would put money in Trump’s pocket, and the second is ingesting the entire story will likely lead to psychosis, the loss of brain cells, and IQ points.",1
Mavs Fans Got Mad At Mark Cuban For Bashing Trump. His Response Is Perfect,"Comments 
Mark Cuban has been vocally outspoken about the 2016 election after learning the dark truth about Republican nominee Donald Trump. Initially, Cuban actually supported Trump’s candidacy as someone independent from politics as usual, but as he (and we all) learned more about the dark past of The Donald’s dirty dealings , sexual predations and more, the Dallas Mavericks basketball team owner threw himself wholeheartedly into the political arena, culminating with front row seats to the last presidential debate. 
Cuban sat down with local radio broadcasters to discuss rumors that his anti-Trump stance might cost him ticket sales for his NBA franchise. Mark Cuban probably, literally dropped the mic after this response: 
“You know what, when it’s all said and done, I’d rather lose every penny than have Trump as president because I care more about the future of my family, my children than I do about my pocketbook. And so if it means we play to empty arenas, I’m down with that.” 
“Maybe I pick up some fans. Maybe I lose some fans. I don’t know,. I’ve heard it from both. I’ve had people say ‘there’s no way I can support you. I can’t go to another Mavs game.’ And I’ve had people say ‘you know what? We’re buying Mavs tickets.’ What I’ve heard more often than anything is, ‘are you gonna be this way once the election’s over?’ And the answer is no. You’ve known me forever Newy and I’ve been apolitical my entire adult life and only because I know Donald and I know my feelings about what he would be like as president have I gotten this involved but come November 9, it’s all Mavs all the time.” 
Mark Cuban is a shining example of how any American should approach the political arena, which he does by placing integrity over ideology and the good of the country in his viewpoints above the simple view of his bank account’s short term health. Luckily, Cuban is a franchisee in the NBA, which is far and away America’s most progressive major sports league, which doesn’t guarantee ongoing success, but does mean that the typical NBA fan values tolerance and diversity over racial segregation and hatred.",1
Trump Silent As Iowa Cop Killer Identified As One Of His White Supporters,"Comments 
During the middle of the night, the city of Des Moines in Iowa was rocked with violence as a man opened fire on police officers in “ambush” style, killing two. The suspect is a white male, as per police reports, and has just been taken into custody. 
What we do know about this man is that his mind is a whirlwind of hatred and hypocrisy. He was kicked out of a football game in October for waving a Confederate flag at football players kneeling during the National Anthem in protest of police violence against blacks. 
“I was offended by the blacks sitting through our anthem. Thousands more whites fought and died for their freedom. However this is not about the Armed forces, they are cop haters.” said Greene in a rant tinged with white nationalist themes, three weeks before he would ambush two policemen in their patrol car and killing them both. 
The Trump camp is silent as a man who supports him embarks on an act of anti-government violence that Trump himself has been calling for . The muted response is infuriating, especially for the blacks and Muslims of America who have been demonized by right-wingers for trying to stop racial/ethnic profiling and ask they be given the benefit of the doubt that white Americans get. 
Why does the media refuse to call this what it is – terrorism? Where was Greene radicalized? Why won’t Donald Trump say “radical white terrorism?” Is he part of a larger white supremacist terror group? We need to put a stop to white men entering this country until we can figure out what the hell is going on. Sound familiar? 
While civic institutions like Black Lives Matter and the Council of American-Islamic Relations (CAIR) are smeared as terror groups for daring to ask some uncomfortable questions and demanding that the rights bestowed upon the American people are enforced equally for all her citizens, the real terror threat – as confirmed by the FBI, no less – comes from white conservatives.

FOX News Just Admitted It Made Up Story About Hillary Being “Indicted” For Foundation,"Comments 
The alt-right and other Trump supporters were flush with excitement yesterday as their online echo chamber resounded with stories that Hillary Clinton was about to be indicted on the basis of the newly discovered emails on Anthony Weiner’s computer. Today, of course, we learned that this was nothing but a bold-faced lied. While many of the more obscure right -wing blogs named nothing but imaginary sources to support their outrageous claims , the most legitimate source of the false story was none other than Fox News. 
On November 2 Fox News’ Bret Baier claimed that, according to two anonymous sources within the FBI, the agency’s investigation of Clinton would “continue to likely an indictment.” The very next day reality forced him to walk back those claims, which he called “inartful,” acknowledging that “that’s not the process.” 
Nonetheless, Baier did not entirely disavow his ruse of an imminent Clinton indictment, maintaining that “there is confidence in the evidence.” Given that Clinton’s indictment has been impending for months in the right-wing universe one would think that these shameless schemers would have wised up to the fact that it’s not going to happen – and for good reason . Instead, every time there is the slightest mention of Clinton’s emails, no matter how vague and clearly inconsequential , the alt-right rumor mill kicks into overdrive on its vicious crusade to smear the potential first female president in any way possible. 
In reality, there is absolutely nothing so far to suggest that there is anything incriminating in the most recent batch of Clinton emails, and it has become increasingly clear that FBI Director James Comey’s announcement of the renewed investigation was nothing but a cynical and hypocritical political ploy. In part the announcement was designed to fuel a new Republican storyline that Clinton is unfit for the presidency because she is under federal investigation. The demagogues making these claims conveniently ignore the fact that Trump is under investigation in no fewer than 75 cases , including the rape of a 13 year-old girl. 
Another disconcerting storyline in yesterday’s firestorm of right-wing rumors is the political interference of Trump supporters in the FBI. If Baier’s so-called anonymous sources really were FBI agents, it would represent yet another recent example of meddling in the presidential election by Trump supporters at the supposedly impartial agency. In any case, the endless lies and distortions of the right-wing pseudo-media, from Fox News down to the lowliest blog, are doing a tremendous disservice to the American people.",1
BUSTED: Trump’s Campaign Chief Behind FBI’s Review Of Clinton Foundation,"It’s becoming more and more clear that not only do we have to contend with electoral interference from foreign government, but from within as well. FBI Director James Comey’s decision to reignite the controversy witch-hunt directed at Hillary Clinton and her private email server was an appalling show of partisan scheming by the FBI, and it’s becoming clear that the entire agency is working to undermine the Democratic nominee in clear violation of the Hatch Act. 
The New York Times has revealed that the FBI’s investigation of the Clinton Foundation was based on the rantings of a wingnut conspiracy theorist who wrote the an anti-Clinton propaganda tract. 
“…had not developed much evidence and was based mostly on information that had surfaced in news stories and the book ‘Clinton Cash,’ according to several law enforcement officials briefed on the case.” 
Clinton Cash, written by Peter Schweizer, has been best described as : 
“a trainwreck of sloppy research and shoddy reporting that contains over twenty errors, fabrications, and distortions. Schweizer pushes conspiracies “based on little evidence” that are “inconsistent with the facts” and “false”; takes quotes “badly out of context”; excludes exculpatory information that undermines his claims; and falls for a fake press release.” 
Schweizer rubs shoulders with other prominent wingnuts like Sarah Palin and Glenn Beck, another cog in the conservative agitation-propaganda machine. 
He is also the president of the Government Accountability Institute, an agitprop think tank run by – wait for it – ex-Breitbart CEO and current Trump campaign chair Steve Bannon. 
This morning, it was revealed that Donald Trump donated $1 million dollars to a Marine Corps veterans association run by the ex-assistant FBI director James Kallstrom. 
This afternoon, an FBI official spoke to the Guardian and said Clinton is “the antichrist personified to a large swath of FBI personnel,” and that “the reason why they’re leaking is they’re pro-Trump.” It is clear that there are a great many forces at work behind the scenes trying to destroy the United States as we know it – and Trump is the one with the nerve to claim “rigged election!” Related Items:",1
Trump and Roger Stone Were Just Ordered To Court For Voter Intimidation Tactics,"Comments 
Ohio has become the second state – after Nevada – to order the Trump campaign to appear in court and answer charges of voter intimidation and suppression in urban areas. 
A federal judge ordered Republican nominee Donald Trump, his longtime political advisor Roger Stone and the Ohio Republican Party into court this week to face charges of violating the Voting Rights Act and the remaining provisions of the Ku Klux Klan Act of 1871, which makes it illegal to conspire to deprive citizens of their civil rights, specifically voting rights. Cleveland.com reports : 
The order entered Tuesday by U.S. District Judge James Gwin in Cleveland says the defendants’ response must include any objections to an order “limiting voter intimidation” or “limiting people at polling locations who are not authorized poll watchers or outside the polling stations.” 
The speed in which Gwin ordered the response, while not necessarily signaling how he feels about the case, shows that the judge is taking the accusations of voter intimidation seriously before Nov. 8 Election Day. 
The candidate may use a wink and a nod, but that doesn’t allow anyone to circumvent the federal laws governing elections. The US Constitution places all federal elections under the realm of congressional control, and the Voting Rights Act makes it illegal to intimidate or pressure anyone seeking to exercise their right to vote. 
As the lawsuit indicates, even Ohio Republicans are reporting Trump supporters using illegal intimidation tactics in Cuyahoga County, the home of Cleveland’s large minority population: 
According to Pat McDonald, the Republican Director of the Cuyahoga County Board of Elections, Trump supporters have already visited the county elections board identifying themselves as poll observers, even though they did not appear to be credentialed as poll observers as required under Ohio law. Indeed, Trump’s fearmongering has caused Cuyahoga County election officials to express concerns of instability on Election Day and to raise the prospect of deploying law-enforcement officials to the polls if necessary to address polling place issues. 
Democrats filed suit late Sunday night to enjoin Republicans from efforts which have included fake poll watcher badges and verbal conduct by the Trump campaign and nominee, plus efforts by Roger Stone’s Super PAC to exit-poll minority polling places, when in fact Stone doesn’t run a polling operation and hasn’t during this year’s campaign: 
The lawsuit cites several examples of such comments by Trump made in Ohio, including a statement made at an Aug. 22 rally in Akron. “You’ve got to get everybody to go out and watch, and go out and vote,” Trump said at the rally. “And when I say ‘watch,’ you know what I’m talking about, right?” It also references an unnamed senior Trump campaign official who told Bloomberg News that “we have three major voter suppression operations under way.” 
It also takes aim at Stone and a group he controls, Stop the Steal Inc., and seeks to stop them from conducting “exit polling” in nine cities that historically vote Democrat. These include Cleveland, Philadelphia and Las Vegas. Stone said in an emailed statement that the polls his organizations will conduct will be scientific. “We seek only to determine if the election is honestly and fairly conducted and to provide an evidentiary basis for a challenge to the election if that is not the case,” he said in the statement. “I assume the purpose of this bogus lawsuit is to distract from the voter-fraud the Democrats have traditionally engaged in.” 
Stone did not provide any evidence to back up his fraud claim. 
Ohio isn’t the only battleground state in the fight against Republican dirty tricks at the polls. Lawsuits in Pennsylvania, Nevada and Arizona are also being fought over the same issues , but with each local problem, such as the 94 vigilante poll watchers Roger Stone has signed up in Arizona for his Super PAC. 
The Democratic National Committee is also suing its national counterpart, and just received extensive information about the RNC’s poll watching plans and geographic targeting which is still being held under seal by the federal court. A federal judge is hearing that case in Newark, N.J. tomorrow at 10am and a decision is expected sometime later in the day. 
Ironically, the multi-state litigation is happening because the national Republican Party successfully separated state level parties from the 1982 court monitoring agreement , so now the Democratic Party must file new lawsuits in multiple states in addition to the national case. However, two state party chairmen that are also RNC members have become embroiled in the national case, as well as some of the Ohio issues have been cited in the national case against the RNC. 
The Ohio federal court has greatly expedited this case, so expect more news before election day about rulings meant to protect the general public from vigilante “ballot security” operations.",1
BREAKING: Church Polling Location Caught Comparing Hillary To Satan In Flyer,"Comments 
A Catholic church in San Diego has taken Donald Trump’s calls to demonize of Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton a tad too literally. The Immaculate Conception Catholic Church was caught passing out flyers last week that told parishioners that voting Democratic was a sin, and would immediately damn them to the fires of hell. 
This week, they’ve gone even further, and declared that the lawyer, former First Lady, and lifelong public servant is in fact an agent of the ruinous dark lord of evil incarnate himself, Satan. 
“The devil does this through tactics outlined by Saul Alinsky with the outcome as Hillary Clinton stated ‘And deep-seated cultural codes, religious beliefs and structural biases have to be changed,’ to draw us away from God’s teachings regarding the sanctity of life to those of the world and its prince!” railed the flyer. 
Previously, the flyers asserted that “it is a mortal sin to vote Democrat … immediately after death the souls of those who die in a state of mortal sin descend into hell.” 
This, of course, is not the first time that Secretary Clinton has been compared to the despoiler of worlds. Former neurosurgeon and pyramid expert Ben Carson declared Hillary in league with the devil at the Republican National Convention . A recent poll of Florida Trump supporters found a staggering 40% of them believe that the former New York Senator is a literal demon . 
The irrational and all-consuming hatred that the right-wing feels for Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton is astonishing, and the fact that this is an actual issue shows that either the American public schooling system is entirely failing to do its job, or that a fair segment of the American population has fallen to thirteenth-century radical Christian extremism. 
What’s truly ironic is that if one were to rationally approach this from such a literalist perspective, it is quite obvious that the envious glutton, shameless thief, and unrepentant lecher Donald Trump is Sin Manifest and his supporters are worshiping a false prophet, placing their own souls in mortal danger as they are consumed in heresy. 
But since those are fairytales designed to maintain social control over an illiterate pre-industrial peasant populace, it’s hard to explain this phenomenon without concluding that they may all just be idiots. Forgive me, but at this point my patience with these people is running very thin.",1
Megyn Kelly Finally Reveals The Details Of Ailes’ Sexual Harrassment,"Comments 
FOX News star Megyn Kelly has finally revealed the disturbing details of the abuse and harrassment she endured at the right-wing propaganda factory. Serial sexual predator and fascist ideologue Roger Ailes lost his job as the CEO of FOX News a few months ago after anchor Gretchen Carlson publicly accused her old boss of sexually harassing her and using his position to try to extort sexual favors from her. 
As the male stars of the network rushed to defend Ailes and over a dozen women came forward to share their own stories, Kelly stayed silent – for a time. Now, she’s adding material to her upcoming memoir detailing how Ailes harassed her and threatened her job : 
“Roger began pushing the limits. There was a pattern to his behavior. I would be called into Roger’s office, he would shut the door, and over the next hour or two, he would engage in a kind of cat-and-mouse game with me—veering between obviously inappropriate sexually charged comments (e.g. about the ‘very sexy bras’ I must have and how he’d like to see me in them) and legitimate professional advice.” 
Kelly also claims Ailes offered to promote her through the ranks “in exchange for sexual favors.” At one point, she writes, he “crossed a new line—trying to grab me repeatedly and kiss me on the lips.” Upon her rebuffing his advances, she recalls, “he asked me an ominous question: ‘When is your contract up?’ And then, for the third time, he tried to kiss me.” 
After Ailes was fired (with a $40 million severance package!), he almost immediately joined the presidential campaign of fellow serial sexual predator Donald Trump. 
The fall of Ailes and the backlash surrounding Donald Trump’s “hot mic” audio comments in which he admits to sexual assault have brought the issue of sexual harassment and the ways in which powerful white men abuse women in the workplace into the forefront of the public eye. 
Men like Ailes and Trump have gotten away with their crimes for far too long; women have been forced to suffer in silence, forced to choose between their dignity and agency over their own bodies or their careers and financial well-being – a choice nobody should have to make. The more women that come forward to tell their stories, the more will follow – and hopefully we can someday geld the toxic patriarchy which silences women and allows predators to roam free.",1
A Republican Representative Just Called For Hillary To Be Killed By Firing Squad,"Comments 
Admitted racist Republican State Rep. John Bennett from Sallisaw, Oklahoma, is the next Republican to publicly call for the assassination of Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton. 
“ 2 words … firing squad” read Bennet’s Facebok post, with a link to a right-wing blog blaming Clinton for the deaths of American soldiers in during the 2102 Benghazi terrorist attacks. 
Half-heartedly back-peddling on the threat, Bennett, wrote in a text message to The Oklahoman that the comments were intended to be sarcastic, but that reiterated that Clinton was guilty of treason, punishable by death. 
Rep. Bennet is an outspoken Islamophobe, who has openly bragged about his hatred of Muslims, claiming the Prophet Mohammed “only teaches violence” and paints Christianity as being dialectical opposition to Islam. Just last week, he presided over the waste of taxpayer dollars for an “interim study” on “radical Islam” in Oklahoma , a witch-hunt which ended with him declaring a local imam and the leader of the local Council of American-Islamic relations as “terrorists.” 
Bennet’s hatred cannot be tolerated and his threats should be directly addressed; a public official who threatens the future president is not a sarcastic matter. The frequency with which right-wing politicians are actively repeating the conspiracies of radio-show wingnuts and calling for the murder of the Democratic nominee is absolutely appalling, and a sign of just how far our political system has fallen.",1
Students At Black College Just Got Beaten And Maced For Protesting KKK’s David Duke,"Comments 
Last night, Louisiana Senate candidates vying for disgraced Senator David Vitter’s empty seat took the stage at the historically black Dillard University. Among them was former Ku Klux Klan Grand Wizard David Duke, who is making yet another run for public office. The students at Dillard rightfully came out to protest – but were met with shocking violence from the police. 
Seventy or so students protested Duke’s presence at their college. “They’re allowing a terrorist, a neo-Nazi Ku Klux Klan member to be secured in a building in which we paid thousands of dollars to attend annually,” said political science major Brielle Kennedy , who was arrested moments later. 
Nobody was allowed in the building during the debate, but students tried to enter anyway to express their fury – and were met with pepper-spray and beatings from police, who arrested six students. “They sprayed us directly in the face with it. I was covered on my shirt, my arms, my face. They’re bodyslamming people, they pulled girls’ hair. They’re just acting like heathens” recounted student Hannah Galloway. 
The debate itself went off the rails almost immediately as David Duke began complaining about “Jews ,” saying that “there is a problem in America with a very strong, powerful tribal group that dominates our media, dominates our international banking.” He then went on to say that “[Hillary Clinton] should be getting the electric chair, being charged with treason.” 
What did the police and state board of elections expect would happen when they held a debate at a historically black school in the deep South and invited a deplorable white supremacist and prominent Trump supporter to attend? 
The violence with which the police reacted evokes the violence that white police visited on black protesters during Jim Crow and the battle for African-American civil rights – and is a painful symbol of how little has changed in the past sixty years. The fact that David Duke had the support to qualify for the ballot is evidence enough.",1
Leaked Emails Just Exposed Clear Republican Voter Suppression In North Carolina,"Comments 
It’s another smoking gun in the North Carolina Republican Party’s fight against minority voting rights, which has now moved from the statehouse , into the courthouse and finally into election supervisory boards where newly leaked public records emails prove that the GOP’s policies of racism are overtly aimed at a white’s-only vote at the ballot box. 
A North Carolina Republican elections board supervisor closed down Sunday early voting specifically to appease their GOP bosses, who argued that too many African-American voters would vote together in traditional “souls to the polls” events. 
This completely incontrovertible finding is sure to draw a swift reaction from the Department Of Justice’s Civil Rights Division and hopefully renewed coverage under the Voting Rights Act. Of course, they won’t announce anything about their investigation during the 60-days before voting finishes on November 8th. Reuters broke the news : 
Bill McAnulty, an elections board chairman in a mostly white North Carolina county, agreed in July to open a Sunday voting site where black church members could cast ballots after services, the reaction was swift: he was labeled a traitor by his fellow Republicans. 
“I became a villain, quite frankly,” recalled McAnulty at a state board of elections meeting in September that had been called to resolve disputes over early voting plans. “I got accused of being a traitor and everything else by the Republican Party,” McAnulty said. 
Following the blowback from Republicans, McAnulty later withdrew his support for the Sunday site. In an interview with Reuters, he said he ultimately ruled against opening the Sunday voting site in Randolph County because he had “ made a mistake in reading the wishes of the voters .” He declined to discuss the episode further. 
North Carolina Republicans can’t win with ideas, so it appears that they have completely given up on democracy for the sake of winning. Politics isn’t just a popularity contest; our electoral system is rooted in the sacred covenant that everyone has a voice in how our country is run. 
As usual, the Republican voter suppression squad turned to the old trope of “wasteful and unnecessary” spending as the illegitimate justification to try and suppress minority votes. 
In two emails, on Aug. 11 and Aug. 14, Woodhouse urged Republicans serving on county election boards to follow the “party line” on curtailing the early voting period. “Many of our folks are angry and opposed to Sunday voting,” he wrote. “Six days of voting in one week is enough. Period.” Keeping polling sites open for the full 17-day early voting period “ may be wasteful and unnecessary ,” he added. 
The North Carolina Republican Party and its elected officials have set the gold standard for racially-driven dirty politics, and they’re not even slightly afraid to banter with each other openly about it. 
Fortunately, the Democratic Party fought back and while they could not prevent every instance of voter suppression, it has resulted in more early voting access rather than the GOP’s plan of less. 
“Those who wanted to suppress the vote, they’re going to fail,” he said at University of North Carolina-Chapel Hill in Raleigh. “Right now, there are more one-stop early vote sites in North Carolina than ever before.” 
With only five days remaining in the race, North Carolina poll averages show a dead heat between Democrats and their vote suppressing opponents in the Republican party in the presidential race. 
If you witness voter suppression at the polls, don’t hesitate to call 866-OUR-VOTE.",1
A Judge Just Declared Trump’s New Hotel BANKRUPT,"Comments 
Yet another one of the obnoxiously ostentatious monuments to Trump’s ego is going under. The Trump International Hotel in Toronto is filing for bankruptcy, a mere four years after it opened. 
The champagne and caviar toned tower will be auctioned off after a Canadian bankruptcy judge placed the building into receivership on Tuesday. 
In a story that is now very familiar to all of us , the $310 million project was beset with lawsuits from the start from angry investors who claim that Trump and his partners lied to them with “wildly overstated projections of Trump Toronto’s performance,” telling investors the “worst case” scenario for occupancy rates would be 55%, when in fact court documents show it varied between 15% and 45%. POLITICO details just how hard Trump screwed his investors: 
It is clear from affidavits in the fraud cases and the bankruptcy case that the buyers have taken a financial beating. A warehouse supervisor named Sarbjit Singh, who was earning about $55,000 a year, testified that he borrowed money from his father, a retired welder, for the deposit on his hotel unit; he never closed on the deal, but he says he still lost $248,000. Se Na Lee, a homemaker who was married to a mortgage underwriter, borrowed money for her deposit from her parents; she did close, and ended up losing $990,000 through December 2014, she says. 
Trump licensed his name for the project to Talon International, owned by a Russian-born oligarch, Alexander Shnaider. “The whole business model has been overpromise and underdeliver, and it’s Trump’s name on the thing” said an insider to POLITICO. 
The hotel has been the site of numerous protests against the racist rabble-rouser, and a city Councillor of Toronto has publicly demanded the Trump name be removed from the building, saying in a statement to the project managers that: 
There are some who may suggest that Canadians should just ignore Mr. Trump, or that he doesn’t matter because he is a political figure in another country. 
However, recent attacks against Muslims in Toronto, and other Canadian cities, show that we are not immune to hateful actions against peaceful people. As well, the Canadian government’s similar internment of Japanese-Canadians is a part of our past that is still very painful for many. 
To have the Trump name displayed so prominently on our skyline signals a tacit acceptance of hateful and divisive views. 
Such is the legacy of Donald Trump, disgraced businessman and divisive race-baiting sexual predator: angry citizens, angry investors, bankruptcy, and a prominent stain where the letters of his name once stood.",1
"Kim Davis Could Pay As Much As $225,000 In Legal Costs For Her Publicity Stunt","Comments 
Kim Davis, the infamous marriage-denying county clerk from Kentucky, could be facing more than $225,000 in legal fees. Davis, who claimed she was acting “under God’s authority” and quickly became a hero for many religious conservatives, has been hit with an appeal seeking to have her pay her opponents’ legal fees, which total $233,058. 
Davis’ legal troubles began soon after her stunt last summer when four couples (two same-sex and two straight) sued her for her refusal to carry out national law. The case gained national attention after Davis was briefly imprisoned for contempt of court and made a martyr of herself. The suit itself was ultimately resolved earlier this year after Kentucky’s governor changed state law to the effect that county clerks no longer authorize marriage licenses. 
Davis has not been responsible for her own legal fees, as the anti-LGBT non-profit Liberty Counsel has offered her pro bono services. Now, however, she may finally be forced to pay up as the ACLU, on behalf of the four plaintiff couples, is appealing to US District Judge David Bunning seeking an order allowing them to recoup their legal expenses. Rowan County, which Davis serves as county clerk, has already stated that it will not pay the costs, arguing that Davis was acting on her own behalf rather than the county’s. 
It remains to be seen how the appeal will play out. According to William Sharp, the ACLU of Kentucky’s legal director, 
“ Courts recognize that when successful civil rights plaintiffs obtain a direct benefit from a court-ordered victory, such as in this case, they can be entitled to their legal expenses to deter future civil rights violations by government officials. By filing today’s motion, we hope to achieve that very objective — to send a message to government officials that willful violations of individuals’ rights will be costly” 
Liberty Counsel, however, is contesting the appeal on the grounds that Davis did not technically lose the case since it was resolved by a change in state law.",1
Federal Judge: N. Carolina Is Engaging In “Insane” Jim Crow Voter Suppression,"Comments 
Until this election, nobody knew that North Carolina was a state firmly committed to Jim Crow -style racism, but today it’s been literally difficult to even pass several hours without yet another illegal scam to suppress minority votes being revealed . 
A federal judge slammed North Carolina elections officials in court today in a case filed by the NAACP , where the US Attorney General weighed in to let the bench know that if proven, the allegations would show three major violations of the National Voter Registration Act. 
During oral arguments, the judge explicitly called North Carolina’s voter challenge law a Jim Crow law, like the ones which began apeparing in the 1890s and codified American apartheid in the South, leading to the civil rights laws of the 1960s. CBS reports : 
U.S. District Judge Loretta Biggs said multiple times the challenge process sounds “insane.” The NAACP says counties are violating federal law by removing voters less than 90 days before the election. “This sounds like something that was put together in 1901,” she told lawyers for the state. 
The judge also said she was “horrified” by the number of removals in Cumberland County, which accounted for the majority of the statewide total. “It almost looks like a cattle call, the way people are being purged,” she told county attorney Rick Moorefield. 
Clearly, election boards and politicians in North Carolina are only restrained by the spectre of federal enforcement via the pre-clearance mechanism of the Voting Rights Act. Unfortunately, since the moment that the Supreme Court decided to override the will of Congress and gut the Voting Rights Act in 2013, the impact of that willful act of judicial activism by conservative jurists has echoed in places where racism didn’t arrive with Trump, but festered secretly for decades, waiting for the opportunity to strike. 
The North Carolina officials who conducted the purge said they were following a bizarre state law, which the United States Department of Justice (DOJ) has already indicated that it believes violates the National Voter Registration Act. Here’s how Republicans in North Carolina purged 6,700 voters from three counties, who are mostly Democrats: 
Under state law, any voter can challenge another county resident’s registration, resulting in a hearing where the challenger presents evidence, according to a state legal filing. If local officials find probable cause, the challenged voter is given notice of a subsequent hearing. A voter who doesn’t rebut the evidence can be removed. 
The NAACP lawsuit cites Cumberland, Moore and Beaufort counties, where activists have challenged thousands of voters. The challengers include volunteers with the Voter Integrity Project, which says it wants to guard against voter fraud. In most cases cited by the lawsuit, mail to a voter is returned as undeliverable, which county boards can accept as evidence the voter doesn’t live there. 
The DOJ filed Statement of Interest on the side of the NAACP, saying that if their allegations are proven true in court, there would be three separate provisions of the National Voter Registration Act. Apparently, the judge’s reaction means that they made the case: 
Three limitations on the removal of voters are pertinent here: (1) a jurisdiction may not remove voters based on a purported change of address outside of the jurisdiction using only mail returned as undeliverable and without following specific required procedures; (2) a jurisdiction may not remove voters based on a change of address within the same jurisdiction; and (3) a jurisdiction may not carry out a program of systematic removals within 90 days of a Federal election. 
U.S. District Judge Biggs is expected to rule in the case early tomorrow, but it sounds like her opinion has already been made up after today’s hearing. 
North Carolina voters are facing unprecedented political roadblocks this year and it’s all due to their state Republican party’s all out war against letting people vote. It looks like the NC GOP is getting nervous that nobody will vote for bigotry laws that have damaged their state’s economy, so they’ve got to do everything they can to rig the election by preventing people from voting.",1
"The FBI Union’s President Just Quit, Penned Scathing Open Letter Blasting Comey","Comments 
Director James Comey of Federal Bureau of Investigation stirred up a hornet’s nest with his decision to interfere in our election by giving House Republicans more ammunition to smear Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton over her “email scandal”– and not even everyone in his own agency is happy about it. 
The head of the FBI’s Agent Association (FBIAA), Reynaldo Tariche , resigned tonight to work in the private sector in protest over Director Comey’s decision to use the FBI as a political tool on behalf of Donald Trump. “Importantly, we will not be used for political gains, and any implication that the FBI Special Agents are unwilling or incapable of performing effective investigations is simply false.'” 
And quit he should. Comey’s behavior has been most unbecoming as the head of a federal law enforcement agency who is obligated to remain impartial for the good of our nation. The FBI has no idea what the emails that “may be pertinent” that were discovered on disgraced Congressman Anthony Weiner’s laptop actually contain; there was no need to alert Congress and doing so so close to an election is an obvious move to try to tip the scales in favor of the most unqualified and morally abhorrent candidate our nation has ever seen. 
Read his letter here: 
Dear Members, 
After 26 + years of service for the greatest Law Enforcement organization in the world I am retiring from the FBI today. I have accepted a position in the private sector within the Banking Industry. It has truly been a pleasure and honor to serve with the men and women of the FBI in the relentless pursuit of protecting the American people from Domestic and International threats. I will be eternally grateful to have worked side by side with the most dedicated individuals who carry out the FBI mission 24 hours a day seven days a week. 
My two terms as President of the FBIAA have been spent in a whirlwind of travel, meetings and other important work on behalf of the members of the FBI AA. It has truly been an amazing journey to witness the incredible work being done on a daily basis by the FBI around the world. Equally impressive has been to see how the FBI family helps each other in times of need including; deaths, family illnesses, natural disasters or any unforeseen tragedy. I am confident that incoming FBIAA President Tom O’Connor, the National Executive Board, and our entire FBIAA team will continue the work of advancing the mission of this incredible organization. 
The FBIAA’s mission includes defending the work and integrity of FBI Special Agents. As a non-partisan organization, comment on political campaigns or candidates is atypical for us, and we intend to keep it that way. Yet, in this intensely partisan election cycle, we find our work—our integrity—questioned as it relates to the investigation of Secretary Hillary Clinton’s use of a private email server. Thus, honoring our mission, we will continue to remind federal officials and the public that the FBI Special Agents who undertook this investigation did so with an unwavering focus on complying with the law and the Constitution, as we do with all of our investigations. Importantly, we will not be used for political gains, and any implication that the FBI Special Agents are unwilling or incapable of performing effective investigations is simply false. 
May God bless the FBI family and may God continue to bless the United States of America",1
"An FBI Agent Just Admitted His Bosses Are Pro-Trump, Hate “Antichrist” Hillary","Comments 
Numerous FBI officials, both current and former, say the Bureau is intentionally attempting to influence the presidential election in favor of Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump by damaging the candidacy of Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton. 
The interworkings of the FBI have been generously described as “chaotic” since Director James Comey declined not to recommend Hillary Clinton face criminal charges over her private email server, and this is because, as one current FBI agent described, “the FBI is Trumpland.” 
This is a view shared by numerous other agents , none of which would speak directly on the record for fear of both professional and personal reprisal. 
Comey then turned about-face and wrote a vague letter to Congress to announce the FBI would soon begin the process of combing through new emails which it had recently discovered that were tied to Clinton by way of Anthony Weiner , a disgraced Democratic congressman and failed New York City mayoral candidate who happens to be married to Clinton’s top aid, Huma Abedin. 
The FBI looked at Weiner because of accusations that he had been having illicit sexual conversations with an underage g irl. Comey’s letter was almost immediately leaked by Congressman and self-appointed Clinton inquisitor Jason Chaffetz (R-UT) and the dominoes began to fall in Trump’s favor. Clinton’s polling numbers began to sink, and the negativity surrounding the allegations of various sex crimes committed by Trump began to dissipate as the nation’s perpetually wandering attention returned to the ersatz email “controversy’. 
One FBI agent said that Clinton is viewed as “the antichrist personified to a large swath of FBI personnel” which is why the information about Clinton has been timed to coincide with the election, “they’re pro-Trump.” 
However, not all of the information coming out of the FBI is entirely anti-Clinton. Trump’s former campaign manager and former Putinist operative Paul Manafort, is also said to have an active investigation open against him and that the investigation is in its early stages. 
A former FBI official has a different take on the matter and said, “There are lots of people who don’t think Trump is qualified, but also believe Clinton is corrupt. What you hear a lot is that it’s a bad choice, between an incompetent and a corrupt politician.” 
The content of the newly discovered emails, if they even exist at all, are unknown as Comey wrote his letter to Congress before the FBI acquired a warrant to read the emails. This is further evidence of the FBI’s bias against Clinton as the FBI exists to investigate facts rather than spreading propagandistic rumor — particularly weeks before a presidential election which many have said is a clear violation of the Hatch Act which was enacted to prevent individuals like Comey from using the power of their office to engage in partisan political activities. 
Rudy Giuliani, the former Mayor of New York City, hinted towards these actions by the FBI against Clinton two days before they transpired . He said, “I think he’s (Trump) got a surprise or two that you’re going to hear about in the next few days. I mean, I’m talking about some pretty big surprises.” Now would Giuliani know the FBI was going to write a vague letter which would shake up the presidential election unless the FBI had already decided to take the action and time the release of the letter specifically to damage Clinton? 
The Director of the FBI is a position that can only be appointed by a sitting president, and the director is given a 10-year term. The concern is due to the FBI’s bias against Clinton, and the likelihood of her victory, it would appear all but impossible that James Comey would be capable of fulfilling his duties. The president has the discretion to unilaterally fire an FBI Director. The Congressional Research Service found “there are no statutory conditions on the President’s authority to remove the FBI director.” If Clinton is able to beat back the FBI’s last-minute attempts to influence the election, it is all but assured that she will fire Comey on her first day in the Oval Office.

FOX: Latinos Are Already CRUSHING Trump At The Polls,"Comments 
Republicans are fond of blaming the media for their troubles, but never blaming voters for utterly rejecting their party’s platform of racism, hatred and economic inequality. To some Republican voters, it will even come as a surprise that Donald Trump loses next week’s election, but the signs were all there and here’s an excerpt from just one of the rare Fox News stories that admits it: “ ‘Sleeping Giant’ awake and roaring – early voting shows high Latino turnout “: 
The tens of millions of early votes cast point to strength from Democratic-leaning Latino voters, potentially giving Clinton a significant advantage in Nevada and Colorado. With more than half the votes already cast in those states, Democrats are matching if not exceeding their successful 2012 pace, according to data compiled by The Associated Press. 
Latinos, another group that Democrats have been banking on, are turning out in larger numbers than anticipated, and they very well may be the ones who give the party’s presidential nominee the margin of victory. “We are seeing the trajectory of the election change in some states, but Democrats are also making up ground,” said Michael McDonald, a University of Florida professor and expert in voter turnout. 
They don’t let Sean Hannity or Lou Dobbs on to Fox News Latino, which is probably why it actually publishes some factual stories, unlike Fox News or Fox Business, who just today had to retract an entirely false story about Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton. 
Meanwhile, Univision exit polling is showing that Latinos have the same high level of regard for Hillary Clinton in Florida that they have for President Barack Obama. This level of support is considered key to the Democratic nominee’s strategy to win the Sunshine State, which would act as a firewall, closing almost all of the Republican nominee’s paths to the presidency. The Miami Herald reports : 
Hillary Clinton has hit a key marker among Florida Hispanics, according to a new poll: She’s reached the level of popularity that helped President Barack Obama win the nation’s largest battleground state in 2012. 
Sixty percent of Florida Latinos favor Clinton, the Univision News poll shows. That’s the same number that voted for Obama four years ago, according to exit polls from that election. 
The polls further indicate that Hillary Clinton will probably get at least 60% of the latino vote in Florida, but there’s 9% of the sample that is still not decided, so it could be much higher by the time election day finishes. 
Politico is reporting that the Democratic nominee’s 30-point lead amongst Latino voters in Florida isn’t just a problem for Trump, but that for the entire GOP it’s a “terrifying” prospect. For the wing of the Republican party that likes to win elections, this poll is probably invoking the moment where they see their party’s entire electoral history as the party of Lincoln flash before its eyes, which can only mean that the end of the decadently twisted Grand Old Party is near. 
Republicans wrote an autopsy of their party after their politics of division, hatred and the 47% blew the 2012 election, which declared the GOP dead in the water. Particularly, the report cited the Tea Party’s radical anti-immigration policies, racist dog whistles and the war on women. 
Luckily, that spurred the rank and file GOP voters in 2016 to pick an orange zombie Presidential candidate, a man who has turned off women and latinos like a switch, and added muslims, finished off black people and finally convinced college educated voters to trust that the Democratic party is the only rational political actor that can be trusted. 
Donald Trump’s “safe zone”– THE Fox News Network – is reporting a massive turnout in the latino communities the Republican candidate so despises. 
Now, there is absolutely no way he can claim that the election is rigged next Tuesday night when all of the major news networks pronounce his campaign dead, and the Republican Party along with it. ",1
This Open Letter To Trump Voters Just Told It “Like It Is”,"Comments 
As election day draws closer and closer, it becomes even harder to understand or tolerate Donald Trump supporters. It is conceptually difficult for many of us to understand how anyone could support Trump knowing all we know about him. But many people don’t know what we know, so here’s a viral list that every Trump supporter needs to read before they vote on Tuesday, courtesy of some anonymous Facebook poster. 
So You Want Someone To ‘Tell It Like It Is’? OK, Here You Go. 1. You join a lying machine and call Hillary crooked. But you support a man who refuses to release his tax returns. You support a greedy, self serving, manipulative proven tax cheat. You support a crooked narcissistic psychopath who is worried his tax returns would reveal evidence of financial ties to Russian oligarchs and other dictators of the world. Just like we now know Putin’s puppets illegally paid millions to his crooked former campaign manager, maybe he has been getting paid too. A corrupt little man whose daughter vacations with Putin’s girlfriend. Making Russia great again? A con man who funneled millions of campaign money to his own companies and used campaign money to pay his family handsomely. Using his own words, a disgusting and corrupt man who surrounds himself with a disgusting corrupt people. 2. You say you love our veterans but support a man who believes POWs are not heroes because they were captured? A man who has shown he lacks emotional intelligence when he attacked families of a fallen war hero. A man whose company fired a veteran for being deployed to Afghanistan. A man who insults and derides our generals. 3. You think a soulless, heartless small man who mocked a disabled reporter will make a good president. A man whose first instinct after a tragedy is always self-aggrandizement, like after Orlando mass shooting & when Dwyane Wade’s cousin Nykea Aldridge was killed. As 3,000 people were dying, this man bragged about how 9/11 attacks were good for him & bragged about how his building is now the tallest in Manhattan just hours after the attack. When the pound fell to a 30-year low following the vote to exit EU, he boasted about making money off British economic uncertainty. When the housing market collapsed in 2008 and millions of Americans lost their homes, he said “ I ‘sort of hope’ real estate market tanks.” Trump is always looking out for Trump. How do you believe a greedy, narcissistic man who fundamentally lacks empathy and compassion will be a good president? He is not even a good person. 4. You say you’re patriotic & love this country but you support a man who has so little understanding of the basic parameters of our constitution’s limits & has zero respect for it, except the part he uses to incite violence. A careless small man who asked Russia to spy on our former Secretary of State. A man who trash talks our NATO allies and our president but lavishly praises brutal dictators like Saddam Hussein, Kim Jong Un, Muammar Gaddafi, Vladimir Putin…etc 5. You support a small man who has been married three times and has admitted to infidelity in the past. A man who was accused of raping his wife & has a federal lawsuit accusing him of raping a 13-year-old girl during a party hosted by convicted pedophile billionaire Jeffrey Epstein. A man who comments about his daughters breasts and body. Then you turn around and bring up Bill Clinton’s history with women? I agree with you 100% Bill has a disgraceful history with women but no comparison to Trump who has said cringeworthy, disturbing things about women his whole life. May I remind you Bill is NOT running to be the next president. If you are saying oh, candidates spouses are fair game then you can’t ignore that he is married to a woman whose naked pictures are all over the internet. 6. You support a man whose business career is a very long list of bankruptcies, defaults and deceptions because he is good for our economy? A man who was born into wealth and built that wealth by scamming, stiffing and bullying ordinary working citizens of this great country. 7. Yes, Hillary is not perfect, then again no one is. You call her dishonest but support a narcissistic pathological liar? Every time Trump opens his mouth every other word that comes out is a lie. Fact checkers have proven it over and over again. We are talking about a man who makes things up to spew hate and fear, like when he lied about seeing an Iran ransom video and a video of muslims celebrating in New Jersey on 9/11. The man is incapable of telling the truth and he is delusional. 
8. You support a hypocritical man who hired undocumented immigrants for his real estate projects & exploited our visa program. He is a man capable of solving our immigration problem? 9. I agree 100% if she’s elected Hillary and her whole family must distance themselves from the Clinton foundation. Let other people continue the great work the foundation is doing. With that said, you support a man whose foundation is found guilty of a pay-to-play scam and false claims of giving on its tax forms and then turn around and try to push fabricated scandals about the Clinton foundation. The IRS found the con man used funds from his charitable foundation to make a campaign donation to Florida Attorney General Pam Bondi. Just after 4 days of the bribe payment Pam dropped Trump U case. He also held $150K fundraiser for Pam after she dropped a criminal case against his university. His foundation claimed on its tax return forms that it gave $10,000.00 to The Giving Back Fund, but the organization says that donation does not exist. A man who completely retooled his charity to spend other people’s money. A man with deep ties to global financiers, foreign politicians and criminals. 10. You claim the con man whose line of clothing and accessories are made in Bangladesh, China, Honduras and other low-wage countries is the man to fix our labor laws? You claim the man who outsources everything is the answer to creating jobs here at home? 11. You claim the unfit, unstable Putin’s little puppet whose campaign is fully embracing alt-right’s anti-Muslim and anti-Immigrant ideologies with all their conspiracy theories is the one to unite the country? 12. You support a bottom feeder who put racial discrimination in housing at the heart of his real estate developments, started the birther movement, said “Obama would look perfect on food stamps, he has the right face for it,” and has shown he is prejudice with his actions & words over and over again. Then he pretends he cares about the black communities. He brings up Hillary’s reference to a group of violent repeat criminals as “super-predators” in 1996? I don’t agree with her choice of words all those years ago but she has apologized since. Something Trump refuses to do. Of course you can use all kind of deflection tactics & tell yourself whatever makes you feel better but the reality is if you are supporting a racist, misogynistic, xenophobic, bigoted, unfit, unqualified, disgusting con man, you really should admit to yourself you don’t care what he says or does. You are using your hatred to cloud your judgement.",1
Moby Just Destroyed Trump In A Passionate Defense Of Hillary,"Comments 
Famous techno musician Moby tore into Republican nominee Donald Trump today in an op-ed published in RollingStone magazine, tearing into the racist rabble-rouser with unrepentant fury. “I’m tired of being a mealy-mouthed, NPR-listening lefty who has to respect other people’s opinions” writes Moby. “Trump is an actual sociopath.” 
Distraught at the unrelenting vitriol being hurled at Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton, Moby disparages the naivete with which he feels many voters are approaching the election. 
If you have a 25-year-old who’s a Jill Stein supporter but they were nine when Ralph Nader handed the presidency to George W. Bush, they don’t know better. There are a lot of people who have lived in a relatively benign bubble, like young women who just assume that Roe v. Wade will always be the law of the land. I think that there’s an innocence that is informing a lot of people’s desire not to vote, or to vote for Jill Stein, but it’s because they’ve had eight years of Obama. And I think that that innocence is making some of them naive and delusional. 
He then goes on to detail just why a Donald Trump presidency is enough of a threat for him to be so undiplomatic in his approach. 
I think there is something seriously broken inside him where he’s an actual sociopath and on the spectrum pretty close to being a psychopath. He’s done nothing to indicate that he’s even capable of feeling empathy [for anyone] except for himself. 
[A Trump presidency would be] death by 1,000 Republican cuts. It basically gives the NRA the ability to write gun policy. It gives the coal industry and the oil industry the ability to write energy policy. It’s handing the keys to people who want to advance policy measures that are just — again, I try and be diplomatic, but they’re trying to advance policy measures to protect their corporate interests or protect their personal interests but to the egregious detriment of our country. 
With Trump, you get a belligerent racist who’s most likely a sociopath [and] definitely a racist and misogynist with no governing experience. And with Hillary, you get an incredibly bright, progressive, strong, experienced legislator. There’s no choice unless you’re ignorant, delusional or racist. 
He’s absolutely right on that point. While the “death by 1,000 Republican cuts” is the threat posed by any Republican candidate for the Presidency, the figure of Donald Trump is a threat to our Republic as we know it, and there can be only one choice. 
I’ve given more money to Democrats this cycle than I’ve ever given in an election season. I’ve done phone-banking, tweeted, Facebooked and Instagrammed, probably to my own personal detriment — the detriment of my friendships [and] certainly the detriment of my professional life – but honestly, the results of this election are more important than most. I’d rather lose fans and have a hand in trying to keep Donald Trump out of the White House than trying to protect a career. A career pales in comparison to the health and wellbeing of our country and our planet. 
What I learned a long time ago is if you’re a public figure and you’re opinionated and outspoken, people will hate you for it — even if they agree with what you’re saying. But it’s really nice: I’ve been doing this for a long time and at this point I just don’t care. What’s someone gonna do — not buy my records? It’s 2016, no one buys records anyway.",1
A Trump Supporter Just Held Six Children At Gunpoint For Dumbest Reason Ever,"Comments 
From Hillary Clinton on the electric chair to African-American effigies hung from trees , Trump supporters are clearly very passionate about their lawn displays. Add to the list a 56 year-old Michigan Man who is now facing felony weapons charges after holding six children – ages 12 to 14 – at gunpoint and forcing them to the ground for allegedly knocking down his Trump yard sign. 
That’s right. The kids were terrorized at gun point over a Trump yard sign. 
Michael Kubek, 56, of Allen Park, MI, said that he was angry at the children because he believed they had ‘vandalized’ his Trump sign, although he hadn’t actually seen them do it. The children told the police that they were simply walking to a local park when an unhinged Kubek “pulled out a pistol and ordered them to sit down on a neighbor’s lawn.” In any case, it appears that the ‘vandalism’ consisted in the sign simply being knocked down – perhaps Kubek should take out his anger on the wind – and the children were reportedly “traumatized” by the experience. 
When police, who were called to the scene by Kubek’s mother, arrived, they found the children lying on the grass with Kubek “standing over them yelling and cursing.” The children said he had pointed a gun at them and a neighbor described Kubek using “very profane language.” According to local news channel Fox 2, “the kids said they tried to tell Kubek they did not damage his sign, but it only resulted with Kubek telling them to shut up and continue cursing at them.” 
Kubek claims he felt “threatened” because he was “outnumbered” by the adolescents and invoked his second amendment right. Luckily, he was arrested by local police and had his gun confiscated — although he has now been released on a $5,000 bail. 
Just another day in Trump’s America, folks. Hopefully, the nightmare will be over soon…",1
"A Republican Election Official Just Blocked Door, Demanded Early Voters “Shut Up, Go Home!’","Comments 
A Republican election commissioner and volunteer poll watcher has been accused of voter intimidation after he tried to drive away voters from an early-voting polling place in Pine Bluff, Arkansas. The man, Stu Soffer, is a prominent Trump supporter who serves on the election commission of the majority-black Jefferson County. He has been the subject of national scrutiny before, most notably when he brandished a gun at an Election Commission meeting this Spring and then followed it up with quid-pro-quo corruption over the summer. 
Now, Soffer is facing suit in the local circuit court after Jefferson County Clerk Patricia Johnson and unrelated Pine Bluff voter Victor Johnson accused him of “interfering with and intimidating voters” at the Jefferson County Courthouse on October 24. According to attorney Chris Burks, who is representing Mr. Johnson, Soffer “stood in the doorway of the early voting location and told voters to ‘shut up and go home.’” 
Johnson states in his filings that he was waiting in line at the polling place when Soffer entered with a TV reporting crew. When a county sheriff told Soffer that the TV crew was causing a disturbance and ordered one of its members to leave, Soffer apparently blocked the door to the voting booths and yelled at the assembled citizens to “shut up and go home.” The suit filed by Mr. Johnson states that, “as a result of the disruption caused by Stu Soffer and other Republicans I was not able to cast my ballot that day.” Dozens of other likely voters were apparently turned away in similar fashion. 
Soffer resigned his position as a poll watcher in the aftermath of the incident, but the suit filed on behalf of Mr. Johnson is seeking to have him removed from his position on the county election commission as well. Soffer refused to comment when contacted by local publication Arkansas Online and a hearing date is yet to be set for the case. 
This admittedly localized incident comes against a backdrop of a massive campaign of voter suppression targeting minority communities that is underway across the nation , usually justified by the chimera of voter fraud . Republican officials and commissioners, knowing that Trump’s bigoted rhetoric will cost them the election in any fair vote, are using every dirty trick in the book to suppress minority turnout in a campaign of intimidation that a federal judge in North Carolina rightly characterized as “insane” and “like something that was put together in 1901.”",1
New Watergate: Someone Bugged The Democratic National Headquarters,"Comments 
A new story about the cyber attack on Democratic National Committee headquarters is giving rise to new questions. We have to stress that as of right now, it’s a single source exclusive report from Mother Jones , which comes from unnamed DNC sources who are quoted on background only. MJ reports that the Democratic Party’s outside security company found signal intelligence indicating that a cellular interception device was being deployed to intercept DNC, and that that information and technical details were turned over to the FBI for investigation. 
In an episode reminiscent of Watergate, the Democratic Party recently informed the FBI that it had collected evidence suggesting its Washington headquarters had been bugged, according to two Democratic National Committee officials who asked not to be named by Mother Jones : 
The second sweep, according to the Democratic officials, found a radio signal near the chairman’s office that indicated there might be a listening device outside the office. “We were told that this was something that could pick up calls from cellphones,” a DNC official says. “The guys who did the sweep said it was a strong indication.” No device was recovered. No possible culprits were identified. 
The DNC sent a report with the technical details to the FBI, according to the DNC officials. “We believe it’s been given by the bureau to another agency with three letters to examine,” the DNC official says. “We’re not supposed to talk about it.” 
The FBI did not respond to a request for comment 
Of course, would not the first time that Democratic National Committee headquarters have been targeted for bugging to intercept the information contained within those walls. 
We already know that the DNC’s emails have been compromised already, which itself IS a second Watergate incident not materially different than stealing memos from a filing cabinet. 
However, we cannot stress enough that the Mother Jones report may be inaccurate because is not supported by a major disclosure of the underlying facts, named sources or other corroborating media reports.

Arkansas Republicans Put The Word “Liar” In Hillary’s Name On Ballot,"Comments 
The signs that the Republican Party is purposefully doing everything they can to repress the vote and use every trick in the book to somehow sway voters is clear as day. As the Donald Trump campaign is hit with four different lawsuits over their voter suppression campaigns, it’s been discovered that the early voting ballots in Arkansas have a very disturbing “typo” on t hem. 
Early voting ballots in Lanoke County read “Hilliary Clinton.” 
Since the Republican Party has been demonizing Hillary Clinton for being “crooked” and a “liar” and a literal demon for years on end, it’s hard to imagine this being an honest “typo.” 
It’s just another subliminal way that the right-wing is trying to tip the scales in favor of their candidate, who, we need not remind you, is actually an a pathological liar, a serial sexual predator, a thief, and a racist.

BREAKING: Judge Issues Restraining Order Against Donald Trump,"Comments 
A federal judge in Ohio has slapped the Trump Campaign and dirty trickster Roger Stone with a restraining order for their minority voter intimidation tactics. Judge James S. Gwin issued an order that prohibits the Trump campaign and Roger Stone or his super PAC “Stop the Steal” from seven illegal activities, listed below. Stone did not make an appearance or send counsel. Amazingly, the Ohio Republican Pary avoided being enjoined by the order. 
Ohio Democratic Party Chairman David Pepper said in a statement to Cleveland.com that “with this decision, Ohioans can feel confident that they will be able to make their voices heard in this election.” Yale educated civil rights lawyer Subodh Chandra gave a play by play of the hearing on twitter, and noted that the Trump campaign had few answers for the judge’s questions. Chandra’s conclusions about the voter suppression hearing reflect the new terrain that the Republican party and Trump campaign have blazed in their open desire to suppress the vote: Graduating @YaleLawSch 22 yrs ago, I never thought I'd be sitting in a fed ct watching a hrng re enforcement of the KKK Act for an election. 
— (((Subodh Chandra))) (@SubodhChandra) November 4, 2016 
The federal judge’s ruling prohibits the following illegal behaviors by Donald Trump, Roger Stone and “Stop the Steal”: 
a. Hindering or delaying a voter or prospective voter from reaching or leaving the polling place fixed for casting the voter’s ballot; 
b. Engaging in any unauthorized “poll watching” activities inside of polling places, within one hundred feet of polling places (“the buffer zone”)11, or within ten feet of a voter standing in a line extending beyond the buffer zone.12 Unauthorized “poll watching” includes challenging or questioning voters or prospective voters about their eligibility to vote, or training, organizing, or directing others to do the same; 
c. Interrogating, admonishing, interfering with, or verbally harassing voters or prospective voters inside polling places, in the buffer zone, or within ten feet of a voter standing in line outside the buffer zone, or training, organizing, or directing others to do the same; 
d. Distributing literature and/or stating to individuals at polling places, in the buffer zone, or within ten feet of a voter standing in line outside the buffer zone, that voter fraud is a crime, or describing the penalties under any Ohio or Federal statute for impermissibly casting a ballot, or training, organizing, or directing individuals to do the same; 
e. Gathering or loitering, or otherwise being present without the intention to vote, at polling places, in the buffer zone, or within ten feet of a voter standing in line outside the buffer zone; 
f. Following, taking photos of, or otherwise recording voters or prospective voters, those assisting voters or prospective voters, or their vehicles at or around a polling place, or training, organizing, or directing others to do the same; 
g. Questioning, and training, organizing, or deputizing any persons to question voters at Ohio polling places, in the buffer zone, or within ten feet of a voter standing in line outside the buffer zone, under the guise of the purported “exit polling” or “citizen journalist” operations organized and encouraged by Defendants Stone and Stop the Steal. 
The Republican National Committee was also in court this morning, and a federal judge in Newark heard both sides of the DNC’s national action to stop minority voter intimidation under a 1982 consent decree. Spokesmen for the Democratic lawyers said that they were satisfied with the results of the hearing, and that the judge said he wouldn’t finish ruling today, but that a decision may be disseminated over the weekend in the emergency litigation. 
The Republican nominee’s efforts at voter intimidation and a campaign of suppressing the vote are the last refuge of a political loser. More importantly, Trump and Stone’s actions violate the federal laws meant to protect the right to vote, democracy and civil rights in America for all citizens.",1
Trump Just Revealed He’s Going To End ALL Federal Clean Energy Development,"Comments 
Republicans have successfully conducted an entire primary and general election without addressing a single key issue on the campaign trail. Now that we’re just days from the election ending, Donald Trump’s campaign has finally addressed climate change – by planning to cut $100 billion dollars in climate change spending, presumably to pay for the ridiculous tax cuts to the rich he proposes. 
It’s been days since the Trump campaign policy was unveiled, but the mainstream media hasn’t even noticed. Most major media outlets who consider themselves “objective” are interested in “FBI has become Trumplandia” drama, more than this vitally important policy matter that might actually inform voters. Luckily, Bloomberg noticed and reports : 
Donald Trump says he would save $100 billion over eight years by cutting all federal climate change spending—a sum his campaign says would be achieved by eliminating domestic and international climate programs. 
“We’re going to put America first. That includes canceling billions in climate change spending for the United Nations, a number Hillary wants to increase, and instead use that money to provide for American infrastructure including clean water, clean air and safety,” the Republican presidential candidate said Oct. 31 at a rally in Warren, Mich. “We’re giving away billions and billions and billions of dollars,” he said. The Trump campaign did not give a specific tally to account for the $100 billion total in response to a query from Bloomberg BNA. 
But in an e-mail, the campaign press office said that the figure combined an estimate of what the Obama administration had spent on climate-related programs, the amount of U.S. contributions to an international climate fund that Trump would cancel, and a calculation of what Trump believes would be savings to the economy if Obama’s and Clinton’s climate policies were reversed. The Trump campaign said the $100 billion total included $50 billion, or what it estimated the Obama administration has spent on programs related to climate change. “Eliminating that spending will save similar amounts over the Trump administration,” it said. 
Trump and his elected Republican supporters have spent this entire election practicing the art of political distraction by choosing a reality TV clown for President, and it’s worked perfectly on the mainstream media who have ignored actual policy for months, feasting on the high ratings of substantive debates about plagiarism, pussy grabbing and Putin. 
This story is important for any voter who’s not sure what you’re getting between the two parties, or torn between a third-party and Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton. While a third-party might promise the moon and the stars, letting Republicans take over the Oval Office with Trump guarantees that climate change efforts will be defunded, quickly. 
The first beneficiary of that kind of environmental know nothing-ism would be the Koch Brothers, oil companies and the wealthiest of the wealthy who will get the savings on their tax bills when Trump slashes every form of taxation on the rich to benefit himself and the top 1% of earners.

In this amusing but alarming musical number, famed songstress Rachel Bloom joins a star-studded crew to pen a parody of “We Are The World” as a last-ditch attempt to remind American voters of just what exactly is at stake in this election, pleading with the American people to please, please not vote for Donald Trump. 
Joined by such star-studded names like Zach Reino, Jack Dolgen, Moby, Mayim Bialik, Adam Scott, Adam Pally, Melissa Rauch, Jane Lynch, Jesse Tyler Ferguson, Bloom has a simple statement for everyone: “Holy Sh*t, Get Out And Vote.” 
“ I can’t believe I’ve had to stoop so low. But an orange talking STD has driven me to this recording studio! And now Moby is on the drums while Elizabeth Banks plays bass. So we can try to convince the USA not to shoot itself in the face.” 
At this point in the game, if you haven’t accepted that Donald Trump is a serial sexual predator who has made his entire business career off the backs of others and his entire political career off of appalling and un-American ethnonationalism who would destroy our economy and leave the world at the mercy of the predatory ambitions of dictators like Vladimir Putin, this song isn’t going to convince you. But it’s a fun little diversion that still hits home just how critical the result of this election is going to be.

A Cop Was Just Fired For Feeding A Homeless Man A Literal “Sh*t Sandwich”,"Comments 
In one of the more disturbing stories of police disrespect towards the people they are meant to be protecting and serving, a San Antonio police office has been f ired for giving a sandwich filled with fecal matter to a homeless man. 
Officer Matthew Luckhurst told one of his cop buddies that “he had picked up some feces, placed it in a slice of bread, and put it in a Styrofoam container next to the unknown homeless male. The officer reported that he told Luckhurst to go back and throw it away. The officer said he saw Luckhurst go back and he assumed that Luckhurst discarded the container” said the San Antonio Police Department in a statement. 
Luckhurst was immediately fired, but is appealing his suspension, saying it was just a “joke” that went too far. 
We applaud the San Antonio Police Department for doing the right thing and immediately firing this man, who is a disgrace to his badge. Despite America’s persistent refusal to recognize them as such, the homeless are people who deserve to be treated with the same dignity that every human deserves. 
The homeless are the victims of an uncaring society ruled by cutthroat capitalism, a waste of human potential and a representation of all our sins. For them to be abused by those sworn to protect just goes to show how law enforcement in the United States treat our citizens like occupiers and not as guardians.",1
AP Just Confirmed Melania Trump Worked Illegally As An Immigrant,"Comments 
The AP has uncovered concrete evidence that Melania Trump worked illegally in the United States, before obtaining an H-1B Visa as a fashion model: 
Melania Trump was paid for 10 modeling jobs in the United States worth $20,056 that occurred in the seven weeks before she had legal permission to work in the country, according to detailed accounting ledgers, contracts and related documents from 20 years ago provided to The Associated Press. 
Melania Trump’s immigration status was first questioned in early August after the New York Post released nude photos of the prospective First Lady. 
That led the Washington Post to fact check the story and concluded that the photos were taken the year before she claimed to have arrived in America. The facts are that she definitely worked in the United States before getting her first visa in 1996 : 
Mrs. Trump, who received a green card in March 2001 and became a U.S. citizen in 2006, has always maintained that she arrived in the country legally and never violated the terms of her immigration status. During the presidential campaign, she has cited her story to defend her husband’s hard line on immigration. 
The wife of the GOP presidential nominee, who sometimes worked as a model under just her first name, has said through an attorney that she first came to the U.S. from Slovenia on Aug. 27, 1996, on a B1/B2 visitor visa and then obtained an H-1B work visa on Oct. 18, 1996. 
The documents obtained by the AP show she was paid for 10 modeling assignments between Sept. 10 and Oct. 15, during a time when her visa allowed her generally to be in the U.S. and look for work but not perform paid work in the country. The documents examined by the AP indicate that the modeling assignments would have been outside the bounds of her visa. 
Later reports from the Trump organization about her immigration status appeared to show that under the Republican nominee’s own policies , Melania Trump probably would not be allowed in the country. 
Immigration violations can be re-litigated at any later date, if they are fraud or misrepresentation on any of the documents used to gain entry or US citizenship, although this almost never happens. 
The AP reports that the United States government only seeks to revoke citizenship in the “most egregious cases, such as instances involving terrorism or war crimes.” 
However, it’s likely that Melania Trump’s immigration status and her Republican nominee husband’s hypocritical stances towards immigration may be thrust into the maelstrom of the waning days of this year’s presidential campaign. 
The big question is: Using the Trump standard for deportation – which would send his wife home to Slovenia – will the Republican candidate petition to send his wife out of the United States?",1
"REVEALED: Trump’s Financial Backers Paid a Playmate $150,000 In Hush Money To Hide Affair","Comments 
The Wall Street Journal has revealed that the National Enquirer paid $150,000 to purchase but never print the story of Republican nominee Donald J. Trump’s affair with 1998 Playmate of the Year Karen J. McDougal. 
The alleged affair happened a decade ago, It will come as a surprise to nobody that Trump and CEO David J. Pecker (yup) of American Media Inc, which owns the National Enquirer , are long time friends. 
To say that the Enquirer has supported the Trump campaign is an understatement; they’ve recently run stories alleging that his rival, religious extremist Sen. Ted Cruz (R-TX) had five affairs and that his father killed John F. Kennedy; that President Obama is a secret homosexual and that Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton had only “six months to live,” published more than six months ago. 
The knowledge of the affair will come as little surprise to most of us, seeing as Trump is an admitted philanderer and an admitted sexual predator. It’s jsut hard to understand how so many evangelicals can still endorse him, seeing as he personifies everything but “family values.” Related Items:",1
Top Congressmen Just Demanded A Federal Investigation Into FBI’s Leaks To Giuliani,"Comments 
With the effects of recent politicized FBI leaks now frighteningly clear, senior Democratic lawmakers are calling on the Justice Department to probe the bureau for leaks to the Trump campaign. Specifically, they’re calling for an investigation into how Trump co-conspirator Rudy Giuliani knew about the FBI reopening its investigation into Hillary Clinton’s private email server before director James Comey made his scheming announcement in a letter to Congress last week. 
Representatives Elijah Cummings (D-MD) and John Conyers Jr. (D-MI), the ranking Democrats on the House Committees on Oversight and Government Reform and the Judiciary respectively, sent a scathing letter Friday to Inspector General Michael Horowitz. “It is absolutely unacceptable for the FBI to leak unsubstantiated — and in some case false — information about one presidential candidate to benefit the other candidate,” they wrote. “Leaking this information to former FBI officials as a conduit to the Trump campaign is equally intolerable.” 
Giuliani has repeatedly bragged about obtaining leaked information from former FBI agents. Just a few hours before the Cummings and Conyers letter was sent, the former New York mayor was asked on “Fox and Friends” if he knew of the reopened investigation before Comey’s announcement. He replied , “Did I hear about it? You’re darn right I heard about it, and I can’t even repeat the language that I heard from the former FBI agents.” 
For his part, Giuliani has denied having any role in leaking the information to the public, though he has in interviews he has been quick to tout his connections to the FBI and has served as somewhat of a middleman between leakers at the bureau and the Trump campaign. He has been adamant about how “outraged” FBI agents are at the bureau’s handling of the Clinton email scandal. Then, two days before Comey sent his letter to Congress, he said that the Trump campaign “has a couple of surprises left” that would be “enormously effective.” 
The Representatives’ letter also criticized the media’s unquestioning use of unsubstantiated “anonymous sources” from the FBI, singling out Fox News’ Bret Baier in particular. On Wednesday Baier ran a story claiming that the FBI’s investigation of Clinton would “continue to likely an indictment,” a lie so nefarious that he felt compelled to actually apologize for his false claims, a rather uncharacteristic occurrence at Fox News. 
The letter comes against the backdrop of an FBI that has increasingly been implicated as a source of a partisan leaks to the Trump campaign. Certain agents and even high ranking officials at the bureau – which in its demographics is similar to Trump’s base – have apparently been funneling sensational and often false anti-Clinton information to the Trump campaign. “These unauthorized and inaccurate leaks from within the FBI, particularly so close to a presidential election, are unprecedented,” the letter said. “For this reason, we are calling on your office to conduct a thorough investigation to identify the sources of these and other leaks from the FBI and to recommend appropriate action.” Related Items:",1
An Influential Pastor Just Nailed Misogynist Male Christian Trump Supporters,"Comments 
The extreme Christian supporters of Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump present themselves as righteous holy rollers doing the work of God, but that is a ruse meant to disguise their true intentions of making women mere sexual pawns and exert patriarchal dominance over them. This fact was aptly pointed out by John Pavlovitz , a minister from Raleigh, North Carolina who published a scathing statement indicting all of the individuals who partake in this behavior. 
Pavlovitz attempted to spare no feelings when he warned women about Trump, his supporters, and how those individuals truly view a woman’s role in society: 
To them, you aren’t separate but equal, as they might claim from the pulpit. You may be made in the image of God, but not in the same way that they are. You are inferior. You are lesser than. You are Adam’s rib meat; baby machines, meal preparers, arm candy, pleasure tools designed by God for men to use as they desire. Some of these men of God will have the guts to actually say this, others will simply prove it to you. They are proving it to you now. Listen to them.” Pavlovitz says in their twisted patriarchal world, the men on the Christian Right think all men act like Trump, all men talk this way, all men think this way, but adds, “No, we don’t—but they do.” 
A line was drawn in the proverbial sand by Pavlovitz who harpooned the hypocrisy of Trump’s supporters. Trump claims to respect women, as do those who are in favor of his candidacy. Yet, that does not rationally follow for if it were true, and if these individuals did have respect for women, they’d dump Trump immediately: 
If these professed men of God truly acknowledged your inherent value, they would be fiercely defending you right now, instead of Donald Trump. They would be openly condemning such disregard for the image of God within you, and sharply severing their ties with him—but many of them they aren’t. They’re making excuses. They’re blaming the victim. They’re doubling down. They’re digging in their manly heels right now. 
The good minister pulled back the curtain to expose the sickening philosophy of these individuals. They care not about women as human beings, but consider them to be mere disposable objects to be used for their own nefarious purposes: 
The real reason they’re doing it, is because to them you aren’t worth defending; not your intelligence or your gifts or your worth. As a result, your consent isn’t really a concern either; you may have noticed that. It’s why, in their minds sexual misconduct almost never occurs, and when it does, it’s because you were dressed too provocatively or sending mixed signals, or because their motives were misinterpreted.They don’t believe you have the right to say or no or to be offended. If anything, they believe you should be flattered. This is the hubris of men who think God made you as an accessory. 
In an act of contrition and humility Pavlovitz apologized for the behavior of despicable men who behave as cowardly dogs. He stopped short of apologizing on the behalf of the men, as if he were their spokesperson: 
As a Christian and a pastor and a man, I’d liked to apologize to you for these men and what you endure from them, but I won’t apologize to you on their behalf because that would mean aligning myself with them and I will not do that. They don’t speak for me. They don’t speak for many of us. They certainly don’t speak for God. 
Minister John Pavlovitz’s statement is worthy of a resounding round of applause. As a man of the cloth he truly embodies the values which he espouses, which is a rare and precious trait in a society full of millions of individuals who support Trump and believe that his word is the gospel. It is truly disheartening and frightening to know that while all citizens in the United States have the same rights, and all votes are equal, that so many would use those votes in a way which is detrimental to the lives of their fellow female citizens.",1
"Game Of Thrones Author Just Ripped Trump, Endorsed Hillary","Comments 
Author George R. R. Martin’s books inspired the hit HBO TV series Game of Thrones , and he’s no stranger to political intrigues. Even the legendary fantasy writer Martin never imagined an American demagogue, who could blithely step on every third rail of American politics and survive in the race until the general election. But the man who wrote television’s most hated character – Joffrey Baratheon – just took to his blog to explain definitively why Donald Trump will never be fit to sit on the Iron Throne be president. 
In my lifetime, there has never been a presidential candidate more unfit to lead this nation. 
You don’t need to like Hillary. You don’t need to listen to what Hillary says about Trump, or what I say about Trump. You just need to listen to Trump. If you can do that, and still consider voting for him… well… 
Martin’s book “Song of Fire and Ice” inspired the hit TV series, which is loosely based on the War of The Roses , as the warring clans of Westeros fight for control of the Iron Throne. For much of the series, the throne has been captured by golden haired Joffrey Baratheon, whose endless list of offensive behaviors begins as a callous child, and continues through his disastrous reign. Like the fictional boy-king, Donald Trump loves to sit on fancy, throne-like chairs and using his family’s wealth and influence to play at being king. 
The author Martin described the highly unusual nature of this year’s presidential election by zeroing in on the striking difference between negative advertisements for the two candidates. He shrewdly pointed out that Donald Trump’s attack ads are standard political ad hominem affairs – lots of selective editing and bluster, no substance – while Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton doesn’t even create traditional attack ads. 
Martin’s list of the many Clinton attack ads doubles as a fine reason that nobody in their right mind, should choose the Republican nominee for President this upcoming Tuesday, November 8th: 
Hillary does not need to use the sort of hoary attack ads that Trump is using. She only needs to present him as he is, and let his own words condemn them. 
And they do. 
No one has to accuse Trump of anything, he has laid it all out there in public for the world to see. 
Yes, he mocked a disabled reporter. There he is, doing it. 
Yes, he told Billy Bush he liked to kiss women without their consent and grab them by their pussies. There he is, boasting about it. When you’re a star, you can do anything. 
No need to accuse Trump of going into the dressing rooms of Miss Universe and Miss Teen USA pagaents when the contestants were changing so he could see them naked. There’s Trump himself, telling Howard Stern about it. 
Yes, he said women should be punished for having abortions. There he is, telling Chris Matthews. His own words, his own face. 
Yes, he said he wants to ban all Muslims from entering the US. Here, see the clip. 
Yes, he’s in favor of Japan and Saudi Arabia and South Korea having nukes, here’s the clip where he says so. 
And on and on and on and on. The Gold Star family, the bad hombres, Judge Curiel, the Miss Universe contestant… his own speeches, his own tweets, his own words. 
Martin even remarked that for a man whose campaign resembles a nastier version of George Wallace, it is eerily starting to look like his braggadocious claim was correct, when in January, Trump said he could shoot a man on Fifth Avenue in New York and get away with it. If there’s any one moment in the Republican’s campaign that could be described as Joffrey-esqe, that was the one, where like the fictional, twisted boy king , Donald Trump reveled openly in a threat to kill senselessly, and kill with impunity. 
The dastardly character Joffrey’s Uncle described him in a way that anyone watching Donald Trump might describe the oddly coiffed Republican candidate, “We’ve had vicious kings, and we’ve had idiot kings, but I don’t think we’ve ever been cursed with a vicious idiot for a king!” 
The same harsh words equally apply to Republican nominee Donald Trump’s disastrous fall as the standard bearer of his failed party, the GOP. 
We agree with George R. R. Martin, all any voter needs to do is listen rationally to the irrational Trump speak, and realize that he’s not Presidential material, and has a personality only fit to be an erratic boy-king, and certainly never to sit in the chair behind the Resolute Desk in the Oval Office.

Russia or the Neocons: Who endangers American democracy? | OffGuardian,"by Vladimir Golstein, via The Duran 
Political discourse of American mass media is inundated with another wave of Russophobia and fear mongering. Besides the obvious military threat (Russia’s nuclear arsenal), or the challenges to the US foreign policy (the conflicts in Ukraine or Syria), a new fear has been introduced into the news: the US political system is endangered by Russia’s computer hacking, informational warfare, and its support of Donald Trump. 
The newspaper titles sound like a commercial for the upcoming Invasion of the Body Snatchers sequel. The Washingon Post announces: “Russia Is Now a Threat. The US Should Treat It Like One.” Time magazine raises the stakes: “Russia Wants to Undermine Faith in the U.S. Election.” 
The Atlantic warns of the “The Dangers of the Putin-Trump relationship,” articulating the already familiar litany of complaints: “Russia is directly interfering in the US elections … it is a dangerous escalation that threatens the integrity of the US electoral process.” While US Today allows notorious neocon named Max Boot to discover not just the threat, but an actual war. His “Time to Get Real About Russia Cyber War,” is rather blunt: “Our democracy is under attack by Russia, but almost no one is treating the situation with the gravity it deserves.” 
Well, nobody treats the situation with the gravity it deserves because they are treating it with much greater gravity. In fact, some of the commentators are so grave, that they are ready to give in already. Zack Beauchamp concludes his tirades against Russian hacking in the following manner: “Russia’s strategy is even more dangerous that it appears. Not only does it undermine democracy using the press but it actually gets the press to undermine itself. And there’s not much we can reasonably do about it, either.” 
Reading all this, one might think that the former Secretary of Defense, James Forrestal , has been resurrected along with his 1949 battle-cry: “The Russians are coming. The Russians are coming. They’re right around. I’ve seen Russian soldiers.” 
What is behind this Russophobia? A real Russian threat? A smokescreen intended to cover failed policies of recent administration? The meeting between the Russophobic minds of a particular candidate (Hillary Clinton) and a particular group of voters (neocons)? 
I believe that these Joe McCarthy type accusations against both Russia and Trump seem to pursue only one goal: to give the veneer of respectability to the neocons’ and other Republican luminaries’ desertion of their own party. Thus, endless “confessions” of reformed Republicans and hardcore neocons , expressing their born-again zeal for the Democratic Candidate, Hillary Clinton. 
The neocons are not switching parties because they’ve seen the light. They are enamored with Hillary Clinton’s record of foreign policy and her willingness to embrace the US globalist claims. As reported by Rania Khalek in Intercept , Robert Kagan, one of the leading neocons, the co-founder of the notorious PNAC (Project for the New American Century, the blueprint of the recent policies of aggression and regime change intended to cement US hegemony in world affairs), has been on the record for quite some time: “I would say all Republican foreign policy professionals are anti-Trump,” Kagan told …at a “ foreign policy professionals for Hillary ” fundraiser… –I would say that a majority of people in my circle will vote for Hillary.” 
The neocons are very public about their desertion, and bear it as a badge of honor. Dubious honor, since in their pursuit of an ideal candidate for their agenda, neocons do not just betray their former party, but the very foundations of American democracy: the two party system. 
Their desertion reveals that American political system has finally internalized Francis Fukuyama proud words about the end of history. We’ve reached the consensus; there is no need to argue or challenge, history has ended, the truths are revealed and they are now the property of the elites united into one globalist Imperial party bent on equating American prosperity with the American hegemony over world affairs. 
To any objective observer it is clear that is not Russia that endangers US democracy but the political corruption, the rule of 1% oligarchy, and mad pursuit of PNAC policies. Even greater danger to democracy lies in the neocons’ desertion to the Hillary camp. 
Unsavory as the corporate rule and globalism might be, one can argue for and pursue these goals, provided they leave the room for the alternative vision. It is this neocons’ dismissal of the alternatives that betrays the very foundations of democracy, at least, in the way, a political philosopher Karl Popper formulated them in his celebrated 1945 treatise, Open Society and Its Enemies . 
The list of neocons and other prominent Republicans rushing toward one party system has been compiled by Eleanor Clift in Daily Beast at the end of June, and had obviously grown since then. Some of them, Max Boot in particular, are pretty explicit about the reasons for his desertion: in his May 8, 2016, article in LA Times , Boot announces simply that, “The Republican Party is Dead.” 
Why? Because it is no longer led by the likes of McCain, Rubio and Romney, for whom Boot served as foreign policy advisor, but by Donald Trump, “the ignorant demagogue” intending to break up “the most successful alliance in history — NATO.” Furthermore, Trump has “kind words for tyrants such as Vladimir Putin.” Indeed, how can anyone in the US political establishment have kind words for Putin? We keep our kind words only for “our SOBs.” 
The simplicity if not poverty of this argumentation makes it difficult to distinguish it from exaggerations, simplification, or ignorance, for which neocons consistently fault Trump. But neocons were never friends of irony; otherwise, they would not make statements about NATO’s spectacular success with a straight face. 
The alliance that followed every whim of its paranoid members, such as Baltic Republics or Poland, and which intended to drag Ukraine into NATO pushing the world to the brink of nuclear annihilation? If this is success, how does one define failure? And talking about exaggerations: “The risk of Trump winning, however remote, represents the biggest national security threat that the United States faces today.” 
As if being “dead” is not bad enough, Boot feels the need to drive a stake into the heart of the Republican Party: the party is stupid . Writing for NYT , the publication that never misses a chance to print something nasty about Republicans, Boot bemoans Republican complicity with Donald Trump phenomenon: “How the Stupid Party’ Created Donald Trump.” 
Why can’t there be an alternative to the neocons’ doctrines of world domination in the form of a populist, nationalist movement that wants Americans to take care of Americans first, before overextending the country’s economic and military reach? And should this alternative be immediately called stupid? 
Yet, for many neocons, it is Hillary or bust. James Kirchik goes out of his way trying to convince his fellow conservatives that it is Clinton who is a true conservative, and therefore, the last American hope: “It’s come to this: Hillary Clinton is the one person standing between America and the abyss.” 
Referring to a profound conservative thinker, Michael Oakeshott, Kirchik observed that Oakeshott “defines the conservative disposition as one that ‘prefers small and limited innovations to large and indefinite’ ones and ‘favors a slow rather than a rapid pace, and pauses to observe current consequences and make appropriate adjustments.’ … Clinton is the candidate of the status quo, something that conservatives, by definition, are supposed to uphold.” 
Kirchick fails to mention, however, that it is Clintons’ and Obama’s implementation of neocons’ policies which is nothing short of revolutionary. Military adventures, drastic regime changes, alliance redrawing, the willingness to sacrifice American lives and money in their pursuit, all these misguided policies that meet no political resistance –that’s what revolutionary. 
Trump’s realism and pragmatic approach to politics appears as revolutionary only to the ideologues who refuse to pause in their drive to reshape the modern world according to their childish dreams. 
This radical reworking of democratic and conservative process of slow incremental improvements into the hegemony of corporate sponsored elites is indeed revolutionary: a modern day version of Lenin’s hegemony of proletariat and its avant-garde, the elite party, all over again. 
Hillary Clinton is as conservative as Brezhnev, who, in his failure to modify or change the radical agenda set up by the party of Lenin and Stalin, was indeed, a conservative. Only an intellectual of Kirchick’s magnitude can see something Oakeshottian in this embrace of one party system. 
As someone who lived under one party rule in the former Soviet Union, I fully appreciate Popper’s rather minimalistic, but fundamental view of democracy, as the society that boasts a two party system and which guarantees the ease of deposing a ruling party in case of its failures. 
Karl Popper insisted on the necessity and practical usefulness of the two-party system, so that the loss of power would lead to self-scrutiny and therefore improvement. While the two parties and their loyal press try to police each other, they keep each other busy, allowing the rest of the citizens to live in peace and pursue their goals without too much interference or control. 
Obviously, all this goes down the drain with the one party system of globalists and the elites, the party that mocks and dismisses as ridiculous or deplorable anyone who happens to challenge it. 
In his The Open Society and its Enemies Popper proposes a rather paradoxical, yet extremely sensible theory of a democratic society. What is important for Popper, is not the discovery of a perfect government, but a much more mundane and pragmatic question: how to avoid the blatantly bad ones. And democracy does it better than any other system. Insisting on this pragmatism, Popper highlights the following syllogism: 
And we do not base our choice on the goodness of democracy, which may be doubtful, but solely on the evilness of a dictatorship, which is certain. Not only because the dictator is bound to make bad use of his power, but because a dictator, even if he were benevolent, would rob all others of their responsibility, and thus of their human rights and duties. This is a sufficient basis for deciding in favor of democracy—that is, a rule of law that enables us to get rid of the government. No majority, however large, ought to be qualified to abandon this rule of law.” 
Popper wrote this elucidation for The Economist ; where he explains his paradoxical thought in the following manner: 
In ‘The Open Society and its Enemies’ I suggested that an entirely new problem should be recognized as the fundamental problem of a rational political theory… how can we best avoid situations in which a bad ruler causes too much harm? 
When we say that the best solution known to us is a constitution that allows a majority vote to dismiss the government, then we do not say the majority vote will always be right. We do not even say that it will usually be right.” 
For Popper, the two-party system is a requirement not because any of these parties possesses the truth, but because they can lose, be removed from power, and thus given a chance to think things through and improve. Consequently, it is the very possibility of losing, and therefore improving, that makes democracies dynamic and progressive: 
From the point of view of the new theory, Election day ought to be a Day of Judgment. As Pericles of Athens said in about 430 BC, ‘although only a few may originate a policy, we are all able to judge it.’ Of course, we may misjudge it; in fact, we often do. But if we have lived through a party’s period of power and have felt its repercussions, we have at least some qualifications for judgment…In order to make a majority government probable, we need something approaching a two-party system…. for such a system encourages a continual process of self-criticism by the two parties.” 
For Popper, the two –party system is preferable since “an inclination to self-criticism after an electoral defeat is far more pronounced in countries with a two-party system than in those where there are several parties.” It is this self-criticism of a losing party; this desire to reform and modernize that provides healthy development for democracies. 
The rule of the last two decades did not improve the economic life of the majority of Americans; in fact, it resulted in the drastic redistribution of wealth. It didn’t bring peace to the world stage. In fact, we are standing on the threshold of nuclear confrontation. 
Yet, in the manner of the Germany in 1930s, we are rapidly overstepping democratic principles for the sake of one party and its global ambitions, of the consensus formulated by the PNAC, Council of Foreign Affairs, Atlantic Council, and other think tanks, along with the State Department, and the press, all of whom argue for the same policies all over again. Even now, weeks before the elections, we are reading about the same bureaucrats in Pentagon, CIA, or State Department, haggling for the place in the future Hillary cabinet. 
It is those rascals that can be sent home, who are worthy of being voted in. And conversely, it is those rascals, who want to stay in power no matter how wrongheaded, dangerous, or unpopular their policies are that should be thrown out. 
There is no absolute truth in politics, there is no end of history, and there is no one size fits all. Popper understood it much better than Fukuyama. History never ends: parties should continue to lose, and thus given a chance to come up with better policies for the next election. Only when Democratic Party is forced to take a back seat, it will contemplate on how it can improve, and offer new policies for the country. 
Propping up Hillary as the best embodiment of the failed policies, allowing the same bankers, diplomats, and generals to metastasize into next election and hold the same key positions in the Pentagon, the State Department, CIA or Treasury, is ultimately, the embrace of one party system; it provides a profound disservice to the United States and its democratic tradition. 
At the last presidential debate this electoral season, Hillary Clinton pretended to be appalled by Trump’s hypothetical refusal to accept the results of the November elections. Mass media echo chambers went into the override mode bemoaning Trump’s disrespect for the venerable political tradition of peaceful transition of power. Trump was never in power, however. 
What is truly appalling is the real, not the hypothetical threat of turning US into a one party system, the system which is so entrenched that it can only mock, dismiss, and conspire to denigrate its opponents. Maybe Mr. Forrestal was right after all. Russians, or rather Soviets, are here, but they do not hack the emails, they write them. Rate this: ",1

Huffington Post Continues Campaigning for Hillary Clinton | OffGuardian,"written by Admin Eric Zuesse 
See this screen-shot taken at 1:30 in the afternoon on November 9th, after Trump’s win. They pretend Trump’s win is a victory for bigots, instead of a defeat for the aristocracy (‘Wall Street’, ‘The Establishment’, or America’s billionaires and their agents such as lobbyists and the leading politicians). 
However, a close look at the evidence shows Huffington Post to be wrong: Trump’s win was overwhelmingly driven by Americans’ repudiation of the aristocracy itself (such as, for example, repudiation of the Institute that runs Huffington Post’s neoconservative international edition, World Post , the Berggruen Institute (including Eric Schmidt , Lawrence Summers , Fareed Zakaria , Arianna Huffington, Nicholas Berggruen , Ernesto Zedillo , Carl Bildt, Niall Ferguson, and Joseph Nye, all being proponents of Obama’s building war against Russia — such as: “To confront Putin, Europe will have to make changes that will be deeply controversial on a continent long committed to environmentalism and marked by an aversion to the use of force”). And, as far as global warming is concerned, which is a real problem about Trump, it’s also very much and demonstrably — not merely in words — a real problem about Hillary too (and one that back in July 2015 before the Party nominees had been chosen, even was courageously reported by some of HuffPo’s own reporters ), but HuffPo and other Democratic Party propagandists pretend there’s reason to believe that Trump’s actions would be even worse than hers have been, and HuffPo’s readers thus end up being little else than Democratic Party suckers who feel satisfied in their ‘news’ reading to soak up what is almost entirely Democratic Party propaganda, which means the propaganda emanating out of the White House whenever a Democrat resides there — sort of like a Democratic Party version of the Republican Party’s Fox ‘News’. 
The aristocracy (all of it, both its Republican and its Democratic Party branches) continue their campaign, and expect to crush their opposition — the public (of all parties). And that’s what a close look at the evidence shows explains Trump’s win — not bigotry on the part of the American public. Bigotry is a huge problem in every society, but especially amongst the aristocracy, who love to pretend that it’s mainly a problem ‘down below’ — so that they can continue to exploit the public while claiming to be superior to it. That’s the Big Lie, which Obama and the Clintons — and Huffington Post — promote and get paid very well to promote. 
Their campaign never ends. Only the personnel do. ",1
How Salon Gets Away with Deceiving Its Readers | OffGuardian,"written by Admin by Eric Zuesse, originally posted at strategic-culture.org Before I start this condemnation of lies from ‘liberal’ ‘news’ media, I should indicate that I am a former lifelong Democrat who left the Party over the corruption of the Obama Administration when the corruption became capped by their Democratic National Committee using many devices to steal the Presidential nomination away from Bernie Sanders, to hand it to Obama’s chosen successor Hillary Clinton, whom Obama expected would complete his pro-Wall-Street legacy by passing into law some version of his trade treaties and by Hillary’s conquering Russia, the latter of which goal was a U.S. government project that had actually started in secret on the night of 24 February 1990 when the then-President George Herbert Walker Bush initiated what has since become a ceaseless behind-the-scenes U.S. government program to expand NATO right up to Russia’s borders and ultimately to conquer Russia itself. Though the Cold War ended authentically on Russia’s side in 1991, it never really did end on the U.S. side (that was just a lie) — and Obama-Clinton were hoping soon to culminate the U.S. aristocracy’s conquest of Russia. I remain a committed progressive journalist but am no longer committed to any political party, because now both of the major political parties are vile and no third party in a Presidential system of government stands a realistic chance of controlling either the Executive branch or the Legislative branch of government — its only function is to serve as “spoiler” for one or the other of the two. So: I am neither a Democrat nor a Republican, nor a supporter of some ‘third’ Party, but remain unchanged throughout, consistently a progressive, which means totally dedicated to truth and against lies (such as dominate all forms of conservatism). My criticisms of ‘news’media reflect that, no political-party orientation. 
On November 9th, Salon’s reporter Brendan Gauthier headlined Salon’s top-of-homepage headline of the day, “In Donald Trump’s cabinet from hell, corporatism and cronyism run rampant — and Sarah Palin may be there, too” and reported what was at the time speculation that was sourced to an NBC news report, titled “Gingrich, Giuliani, Priebus Eyed for Top Jobs in Trump White House: Sources” , which stated that: 
Among the names being considered, according to conversations with three campaign advisers who requested anonymity to speak freely: Rudy Giuliani for attorney general, Newt Gingrich for secretary of state, retired Lt. Gen Michael Flynn for defense secretary or national security adviser, Trump finance chairman Steve Mnuchin for Treasury secretary, and Republican National Committee finance chair Lew Eisenberg for commerce secretary. 
Trump himself has not taken an active part in transition efforts, in part out of superstition: He fears too much planning before a victory might jinx the campaign. In 2012, he was shocked to read detailed stories on Mitt Romney’s preparations for the White House long before election day… 
Alabama Senator Jeff Sessions, a loyal supporter, has taken a major role managing the transition effort, especially as the official transition chief, New Jersey Governor Chris Christie, has drifted from the campaign… 
Asked for comment on the above names floated for cabinet posts, Trump campaign spokesman Hope Hicks replied by e-mail that “none of this is accurate.” 
Gauthier added nothing substantial to that NBC information (of which, maybe, “none of this is accurate”) except to say such uninformative things as that Gingrich “proved himself a rabid Trump surrogate” and as that Giuliani “has been a tireless, if controversial, surrogate for Trump on the trail and in the media.” But in one instance Gauthier linked to a New York Post op-ed by Michael Flynn as being his source by which to allege regarding: “ Department of Defense Retired Lt. Gen. Michael Flynn: Trump’s national security adviser was fired from his post as head of the Defense Intelligence Agency in 2014, which he attributed to his hawkishness.” 
That statement about Flynn is outright false. Here is all that Flynn’s op-ed — Gauthier’s cited source — actually said concerning his having been fired by Obama: 
Two years ago, I was called into a meeting with the undersecretary of defense for intelligence and the director of national intelligence, and after some “niceties,” I was told by the USDI that I was being let go from DIA. It was definitely an uncomfortable moment (I suspect more for them than me). 
I asked the DNI (Gen. James Clapper) if my leadership of the agency was in question and he said it was not; had it been, he said, they would have relieved me on the spot. 
I knew then it had more to do with the stand I took on radical Islamism and the expansion of al Qaeda and its associated movements. I felt the intel system was way too politicized, especially in the Defense Department… 
I was pissed but knew that I had maintained my integrity and was determined in the few months I had left to continue the changes I was instituting and to keep beating the drum about the vicious enemy we were facing (still are)… 
We’re in a global war, facing an enemy alliance that … picks up radical Muslim countries and organizations such as Iran, al Qaeda, the Taliban and Islamic State. 
That’s a formidable coalition, and nobody should be shocked to discover that we are losing the war. 
There was no indication whatsoever in the article, that Flynn had been fired on account of any “hawkishness.” That allegation by Salon was simply fabricated. 
The reality about Flynn’s firing was the exact opposite: he was too ‘dovish’ to suit the neoconservative Barack Obama, who was now demanding that all of his top military generals support his goal of going to war against Russia. Flynn objected to that by saying that only one war at a time makes any sense, and that this war must be the defeat of jihadists, nothing else — certainly not a war against the other nuclear superpower. 
Rather than Flynn’s support of Trump being a reflection of their shared ‘hawkishness’, it reflects their strong belief that the view that Barack Obama holds and that Hillary Clinton holds even more strongly — that the war against jihadists must be subordinated to the war against Russia — is a totally upside-down view of the priorities, and that instead of the U.S. supporting jihadists who are warring against Russia and its allies, the U.S. ought to be supporting Russia and its allies who are warring against jihadists. 
If Salon wants to support the Obama-Clinton view and oppose the Trump view on the basis of truthful assertions, then that’s journalism and it is not mere political propaganda. 
But if Salon wants to deceive its readers into holding the political viewpoint that they hold, then what else is there to call Salon but a propaganda-site? ",1
What do the protesters believe they are protesting? | OffGuardian,"written by Admin 
A victory for freedom, justice and human happiness it isn’t. Those currently frothing at the mouth about the dawn of a new golden age of peace and equality really should know better. A billionaire and friend of billionaires just won an election. 1789 it isn’t. 
But Clinton would have blown up the world. Trump probably won’t. Which makes the current situation a very tiny, possibly temporary, but still vanishingly rare moment of sanity in a largely insane world. For that small reason alone sane people everywhere should welcome it for what it is. 
So, what to make of those who don’t? 
Hysteria. Fainting. Screaming. Pseudo-Leftists happy to support Obama’s imperialism and domestic tyranny, beating their chests and seeking counselling for PTSD because democracy happened. “Mass” riots of thousands (or is it only hundreds? Depends on your source) of outraged identity-politicians. 
What do these protesters think they are protesting? 
Fascism? Well, ok, but where were they during the past sixteen years during which America has been dragged by inches into becoming the proto-facist state it now is? Besides what is more fascist-populist that using riot and civil unrest to overturn a democratic vote? 
Racism? Sexism? Climate-denial? Which of these offenses is worse than nuclear war? And where is it written in the US constitution that they justify the reversal of an election? 
And what about those alt news types supporting the “protesters”? Do they agree with Change.org that the vote should be overturned by the electoral college and Clinton given the presidency because she has a vagina and her chums can mobilise mass-hysteria? Are they basically saying they were for Hillary all along, because the Pentagon and Wall Street and WW3 are the lesser of two evils? 
If that’s not what they are saying, then what? Protest needs an aim, so what is the aim here? More Obama? Martial Law? Total societal disintegration? 
All better than Trump?

How Come Washington’s Humanitarian Concerns Always Result in Population Control,"by Jean Perier , via New Eastern Outlook 
Alleged humanitarian efforts have always been a rather important aspect of the state propaganda campaign carried out by the White House and its media. We’ve seen Washington using its proxy NGOs to fight against the alleged “humanitarian crimes” of the Syrian government, Russia, Iran, North Korea, Venezuela, Cuba and other states that Washington has declared its enemies. 
This large-scale campaign that is said to be driven by “common human values” has been supported by a number of modern American oligarchs. 
Among those “humanitarian champions” one may find the founder of Microsoft and one of the richest businessmen in the world, Bill Gates. He is a figure who likes to be presented as a benevolent philanthropist of sorts. By using the so-called “Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation,” this American oligarch attempts to put on the mask of the official representative of the US… View original post 547  ",1
Bernie Sanders's Hopes and Regrets,"License DMCA 
Leading protests and stirring up trouble in the Senate might be all that's left for Bernie Sanders to do in contesting Hillary Clinton's administration if, as many expect, it deviates from her public embrace of some Sanders positions if and when she becomes President. 
""I won't stay silent if Clinton nominates the same old, same old Wall Street guys,"" Sanders said this week. ""The leverage that I think I take into the Senate is taking on the entire Democratic Party establishment, and, you know, taking on a very powerful political organization with the Clinton people. We won 22 states and 46 percent of the pledged delegates, 13.4 million votes ... and a majority of the younger people, the future of the country. ... That gives me a lot of leverage, leverage that I intend to use."" 
Looking forward to Clinton's expected election on Nov. 8, the 75-year-old Vermont senator said he's begun to draft some of his planks that were accepted into the Democratic platform into legislation: on climate change, minimum wage and breaking up big banks. But given what we now know about what the Clinton machine thinks of him, it's debatable how much leverage he'll have. 
It's not hard to imagine Sanders contemplating what could have been as he sees the two most unpopular candidates in modern history beset by ever deepening scandals: Clinton from Wikileaks revelations and Trump from exposure of alleged sexual misconduct. 
Sanders now knows for certain how the Democratic National Committee undermined his candidacy when it was supposed to remain neutral. And he knows from Wikileaks' disclosure of Clinton's Wall Street speeches, which he repeatedly demanded that she make public, how cozy she is with plutocrats. - Advertisement - 
A Third-Party Run 
In the context of these revelations, is it not reasonable to assume that if Sanders had taken Jill Stein's offer to head the Green Party ticket that such a team would have gotten 15 percent in the polls and a place at the debates? Wouldn't Sanders's presence at the debates have given an alternative to voters who detest both Trump and Clinton and at least a chance to build a viable third-party movement? Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders in New Hampshire on July 12, 2016. License DMCA 
Sanders said he supports Clinton because an independent or a third-party run could have handed the election to Trump. ""I don't want to end up like Ralph Nader,"" Sanders told journalist Chris Hedges. Nader is blamed for handing the 2000 election to George W. Bush over Al Gore with his Green Party run, which kept the vote in Florida close enough for Bush, with the help of five Republicans on the U.S. Supreme Court, to claim its electoral votes and thus the presidency. [For how a full Florida recount would have given Gore the White House, see Consortiumnews.com's "" Gore's Victory "" and "" So Bush Did Steal the White House. ""] - Advertisement - 
But it is questionable whether Sanders would have divided the Clinton vote to make Trump president. Millions of angry voters from an eroding middle class could have supported Sanders instead of Trump. In other words, Sanders could have taken away just as many and perhaps more votes from Trump, as both were insurgency candidates against the Establishment's choice. 
Sanders who hasn't even a whiff of corruption about him might well be soaring above both of them in the polls by now. 
It also appears that Sanders made his decision to support Clinton almost wholly based on domestic issues, which he focused nearly exclusively on during his primary campaign. On immigration, climate change, gun control and a number of other issues, Sanders aligns with Clinton rather than Trump. 
And, Sanders rightly feared Trump's xenophobia, Islamophobia, misogyny, racism and demagoguery. But Sanders overlooked Trump's conciliatory approach toward Russia and Clinton's warmongering on Syria and her open hostility toward Russia. Given Sanders's accurate critique of Clinton's fondness for ""regime change"" wars, a Sanders's victory would have likely offered a greater hope for peace. 
In other words, Sanders had an historic opportunity and, arguably, an obligation in the face of the ruin of the American middle class and the danger of looming global conflict, but he failed to seize it. He either did not take seriously or failed to understand the urgency of the situation. He talked about a ""revolution"" to upend the status quo but ended up supporting a status quo candidate for President.",1
"Hillary Clinton is Playing With Thermonuclear Fire, and You Will be Glowing","License DMCA I would never vote for either Donald Trump or Hillary Clinton, and therefore have no dog in this fight. That said, I am an interested spectator, and clearly see that Ms. Clinton is playing a very dangerous game by using the Russians as an election issue and blaming them for everything. When asked about her leaked e-mails in the last debate, she skillfully avoided the damaging content of the e-mails, and turned the table on the Russians, claiming they are the danger. She argued we should all be alarmed at the attempt by Russia to manipulate our election, a charge which is totally untrue, and without any evidence. The leaked DNC e-mails clearly show that she and the DNC, not Russia, were successful in manipulating the election to defraud Sanders. Ms. Clinton lied about US intelligence agencies. She lectured Trump, saying 17 intelligence agencies said the Russians were behind the Wikileaks release of DNC emails. That is a lie on several counts. First, 15 agencies never said a word about leaked e-mails. Only two said anything, and this is what they said: The hacks ""are consistent with the methods and motivations of Russian-directed efforts. These thefts and disclosures are intended to interfere with the US election process. Such activity is not new to Moscow -- the Russians have used similar tactics and techniques across Europa and Eurasia, for example, to influence public opinion there. We believe, based on the scope and sensitivity of these efforts, that only Russia's senior-most officials could have authorized these activities."" Read it again. That's a far cry from saying the Russians did it, and here is the proof. To this day no one knows who leaked the e-mails to Wikileaks. No one. Clinton's using Russia as a political scapegoat is very dangerous. At a time when there is bad blood between the two thermonuclear powers, it is irresponsible, and demonstrates a callous lack of judgement to falsely accuse Russia of such a deed without the slightest bit of proof for purely political reasons. Provoking the Russians for political reasons speaks volumes about Ms. Clinton. Perhaps the moderator should have asked Ms. Clinton: Has the US ever attempted to influence another nations election, or have you Ms. Clinton, in your capacity, ever tried to influence another nations election? Trump, not a quick thinker, should have attacked Clinton, asking: Are these the same intelligence agencies that lied about WMD in Iraq resulting in over one million useless deaths? Another well founded accusation against her candidacy is her eagerness to make war. She supported the illegal war on Iraq which killed millions of innocents. She pushed and continues to push for the 15-year war in Afghanistan. She supported ""the surge"" in Afghanistan, a total failure. She assisted the overthrow of the democratically elected government of Honduras by supporting the military and a dictator. - Advertisement - She was the one of the primary architects of the Libyan debacle, which led to the bombing and total disintegration of Libya. It is now the leading terrorist breeding ground in Africa. It was Clinton who took on Cabinet members who argued against military intervention in Libya. She had her way. Result; utter disaster! Ms. Clinton never saw a war she did not want to avoid. But now she is playing with fire. Russia has made it clear that they will not tolerate another Iraq in Syria. They will support the Assad regime and not allow the US to overthrow yet another Middle Eastern government. Russia insists the US is intentionally trying to promote anarchy in Syria by destroying the country, maintaining brutal sanctions that only harm innocents, and giving ""moderates"" heavy weapons to help bring down Assad. Russia has drawn a line in the sand, and Ms. Clinton is showing a severe lack of judgment in provoking and blaming them for all that ails the world. She has even compared Putin to Hitler, which historically, is tantamount to declaring war. Manuel Noriega was called Hitler, Saddam Hussein was called Hitler, Muammar Gaddafi was called Hitler. The pattern is clear. Vilify the enemy and attack. Ms. Clinton, we are told, is intelligent. Her actions indicate she is either stupid, or she has no sense of sane judgment, or both. She has called for a No-Fly Zone in Syria, which General Dunford, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff said, would mean war with Russia and Syria. As Secretary of State Ms. Clinton's job was to maintain peace, not start a war. She was not interested in peace as Secretary of State, but did start wars, and added fuel to the many we are currently fighting. She compared Putin to Hilter. No respectable Secretary of State, the nation's chief diplomat, would call another world leader Hitler. Nor does the Chief Diplomat look for and argue for war, by shouting down all who wished to avoid war in Libya. What is even more alarming is that mainstream media has followed their leader, Ms. Clinton, in demonizing Russia. The press has lost its way and is merely an echo chamber for Ms. Clinton and her neocon supporters who are vengeful, militaristic, and bombastic. - Advertisement - In conclusion, take note of those who have rallied to her cause. Numerous war mongers from the past. They smell war, and like the smell of death. They want to escalate the conflict with Russia. Over 50 of those who brought you the War in Iraq, have pledged their fealty to the Warrior Queen. Her past war record, combined with a complete lack of judgment, and surrounding herself with war crazy neocons, make a recipe for thermonuclear war. Of course, MSM has kept the public totally in the dark about the impending day of doom, and most don't even see it coming. As a spectator, and one who would like to avoid a nuclear confrontation with Russia, I now maintain Clinton is far more dangerous to the world's future than Trump, even though he is woefully unfit. Thankfully there is a sane alternative candidate.",1
The big head fake by the US .1% Football team or,"License DMCA 
The play develops with the .1% quarterback doing a reverse pivot (causing the progressive linebackers to hold their position instead of rushing to sack the QB), faking a quick toss to the left outside, where only the down ballot players are located, turns and runs toward the right, threatening to keep the ball, pitch it to Icame/HenowDed or throw downfield to MSM.

Or that the trade deals were a bunch of crap for the 99.99%, certainly the 50%? No, it would not have been prudent. The .1% is not yet prepared to go for total population control this early in their Plan that a Trumpet presidency would cause: riots in the American cities and countryside and the resulting roll out of permanent martial law and surveillance. Their plate was full and their cup runneth over with the likes of a failed coup in Turkey for whom they and their western cohorts must pay the chump change of a couple of billion dollars in extortion demanded by Erdogan or face his unleashing of leased terrorists in European cities.

I could have edumacated myself about who was running down ticket and yelled and screamed and organize but I was too focused on the fact that the .1% was so obvious that everyone would know to vote downtown to throw out the .1% cronies. 
Unfortunately the .1% has a deep bench, and the defense was unprepared. Sucked in by the expectation that the court of referees would throw yellow flags against the .1% for voter interference, personal fouls, holding and widespread unsportsmanlike conduct of the Clinton primaries, I now watch in disbelief as the refs picked up their god damn flags and put them back into their pockets with only seconds left, while the .1% cronies stroll down field pushing barrels of quantitatively eased dollars to win over the brain dead including those with no brains.

"Tom Hayden, Courageous Warrior for Peace","License DMCA 
When Tom Hayden died on Oct. 23, we lost a courageous warrior for peace and equality. Hayden was on the front lines of nearly every major progressive struggle for more than 50 years. Vilified by the Right and at times criticized from the Left, Hayden remained steadfast in his commitment to social, economic and racial justice. 
An activist, political theorist, organizer, writer, speaker and teacher, Hayden was a Freedom Rider in the South during the 1960s; a founder of Students for a Democratic Society; a leader of the anti-Vietnam War movement; a community organizer; a negotiator of a gang truce in Venice, California; the author of more than 19 books; and an elected official in California for nearly two decades. 
""Tom made important contributions as a writer and a political leader, but his greatest strength was as a visionary strategist,"" said Bill Zimmerman, who worked with Hayden in the Indochina Peace Campaign and later managed his 1976 U.S. Senate campaign. ""Tom was able to see far over the political horizon, and was then able to create and lead political movements that were often ahead of their time. Whether it was radical opposition to war or mainstream support for candidates, progressive ballot initiatives and necessary legislation, he was a true leader, clay feet and all."" 
The Indochina Peace Campaign (IPC), founded in 1972 by Hayden and Jane Fonda, who became his wife the following year, was a traveling road show that opposed the war in Vietnam, Cambodia and Laos. Daniel Ellsberg, whose leak of the Pentagon Papers helped to end the war, traveled with Fonda, Holly Near and others for two weeks, speaking around the clock against the war. 
According to Ellsberg, IPC was instrumental in ending the war. While some in the organization took to the road to organize opposition to the war, others lobbied Congress to cut the funding for combat operations. Although the Paris Peace Accord was signed in 1973, many, including Ellsberg, knew the war was not over. - Advertisement - 
Secretary of State Henry Kissinger was pressuring President Richard Nixon to restart the bombing. Congress cut the funding in 1975 and the U.S. war in Vietnam finally ended. 
""IPC was a model of grassroots activism and lobbying,"" Ellsberg said. 
Hayden was steadfast in his opposition to the Vietnam War. He made several trips to North Vietnam, calling attention to the U.S. bombing of civilians. On one trip, at the request of the North Vietnamese government, Hayden returned to the U.S. with American prisoners of war. Since the U.S. government refused to recognize the government in Hanoi, the Vietnamese would only release the prisoners to Americans in the anti-war movement. 
Advice from Dr. King 
A transformative event in Hayden's life occurred in 1960 when he was a college student. He interviewed Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. on a picket line outside the Democratic National Convention in Los Angeles. The picket demanded that the Democratic Party include a strong commitment to civil rights in its platform. King told Hayden, ""Ultimately, you have to take a stand with your life."" - Advertisement -",1
What is the goal of the Progressive Movement: to gain power or to give it away?,"pirate clip art free printable | Illustration of Pirate Skull ...(image by ) The Pirate Party of Iceland, the one nation that jailed its crooked bankers, is poised to win the election, less than 4 years after forming.
Their motto is: "" ""We are not here to gain power. We are here to distribute power."" 
I think this formulation can serve the Progressive Movement in the US, as it approaches mainstream status and is the most popular political movement in the nation, with 67% approving of the term progressive, over 55% supporting Sanders, and a robust majority supporting progressive programs like gun and immigration reform, raising the minimum wage, etc. 
And this formulation also deals with the issue of Bigness, which many think incompatible with democracy and human rights. What if the purpose of bigness (ie winning elections) is NOT to consolidate power in new hands but to change the system by using this status to distribute power. - Advertisement - 
Progressives are commonly accused by the right of being for Big Government, for thinking that government power is the solution to all problems. This Pirate formulation disrupts that claim, by showing a way to use the consolidation of power in order not to create a stronger state but to redistribute power and thus lessen the power of the state and powerful corporations and other institutions, public and private. 
This formulation comes out of the anarchist tradition of decentralized power. The Pirate party has allied libertarians of both the right and left to take power, in order to distribute it from the banks and their servants back to the people themselves. Anarchism, we understand, is self-government, which means decentralized power. - Advertisement - 
The success of the Pirate party shows how anarchists and libertarians of all kinds can come together to form a coalition Big enough to win but committed to breaking up the concentration of power, mostly in the hands of the financial institutions and their corrupt public servants. 
The way to get beyond the ""Iron Law of Oligarchy,"" which over 100 years ago German sociologist Robet Michels, which states "" states that all forms of organization, regardless of how democratic they may be at the start, will eventually and inevitably develop oligarchic tendencies, thus making true democracy practically and theoretically impossible, especially in large groups and complex organizations."" is to use consolidation of power (bigness) in the service of decentralizing power, pushing it back to the people and smaller communities. 
Therefore, the goal of Progressives is NOT to gain power that is the means: the goal is to replace the old hierarchical system with a system of decentralized power, a model of self-government.",1

"Equal Parenting Rights, A synopsis of the facts","License DMCA In a recent advancement, 12 men are in the process of going legal against the state of Utah in the Federal court challenging a law which allows mothers to put their babies up for adoption without the biological father's consent, or knowledge.
Our family court system must re-access this provision and make amendments in a way that establishes the fact that fathers are an integral part of a child's life. Every other weekend and one night a week is not a parent child relationship for sure and hence, cannot be considered as equal parenting. Until the courts cease ordering visitation and start affiliating the fathers with the same rights as mothers, children of divorce will continue to suffer. 
Children's best interest lies in equal parenting. Even after a couple goes through a divorce, equal parenting must be advocated for children's best interest. Some reasons for this are listed below; Fatherless children are at a dramatically greater risk of drug and alcohol abuse, mental illness, suicide, poor educational performance, teen pregnancy, and criminality.""

Terrorists attack police training college in Pakistan: 60 cadets killed and 120 injured,"(7 fans) - Advertisement - At lease 60 cadets were killed and more than 116 injured as terrorists attack the Police Training College in Quetta, Pakistan, in one of the deadliest extremist attacks this year. Three gunmen burst into the sprawling academy, targeting sleeping quarters home to some 700 recruits, and sent terrified young men aged between 15 and 25 fleeing, Dawn News reported. Communication intercepts showed the attack was carried out by Al-Alimi faction of the Lashkar-i-Jhangvi militant group, IG Frontier Corps (FC) Major General Sher Afgan said. The group itself has not claimed the attack. Most of the deaths were caused when two of the attackers blew themselves up. The third was shot dead by Frontier Corps (FC) troops. At least 120 people were injured, according to Dawn News. The IG FC said ""terrorists were communicating with their handlers in Afghanistan"". ""There were three terrorists and all of them were wearing suicide vests,"" he added. The training college is situated on Sariab Road, which is considered to be one of the most sensitive areas of Quetta. Militants have been targeting security forces in the area for almost a decade. 
The attack comes a day after militants belonging to the Baloch Liberation Army on a motorcycle shot dead two coast guards and a civilian and wounded a shopkeeper in a remote southwest coastal town in Balochistan. 
In August, a suicide bombing at a Quetta hospital claimed by the Jamaat-ul-Ahrar faction of the Pakistani Taliban killed 73 people, including many of the city's lawyer community who had gone there to mourn the fatal shooting of a colleague. - Advertisement - Pakistan says intelligence agencies of India and Afghanistan are fanning unrest in Balochistan by helping the rebels and sectarian militant outfits. According to Islamabad Policy Research Institute, the Indian consulate in Kandahar, a border town, provides a firm base to train, arm and dispatch militants across the border to undertake sabotage activities in Balochistan. Indian companies have been awarded contracts on various projects to link Kabul with Balochistan near Iranian border; and in the bargain it makes the job of the Indian intelligence agency RAW easier. Last month Indian government formally offered political asylum to secessionist Baloch leaders. The Zee News of India reported that the media is buzz with reports that Brahumdagh Bugti, grandson of Nawaz Akbar Khan Bugti, is set to get Indian citizenship. He is currently living in exile in Switzerland. 
Balochistan is a key region for China's ambitious $46 billion China-Pakistan Economic Corridor infrastructure project linking its western province of Xinjiang to the Arabian Sea via Pakistan.

The attack on Sept 18, which took place near the de facto border between India and Pakistan in the disputed region, was one of the deadliest on an army base in Kashmir since militant attacks began in 1989, according to CNN. Tension remains high between the neighbors following the Uri attack. The Indian Prime Minister, Narendra Modi, has been under intense pressure from his own party and the Indian public to respond to the Uri army base attack. Mr Modi came to power pledging to toughen India's response to what he calls cross-border incursions from Pakistan. He vowed that the Uri raid ""will not go unpunished"". On September 29, India announced that it had carried out early morning ""surgical strikes"" on terrorist camps in Pakistani controlled Kashmir. However, Pakistan denied that a cross border strike had taken place, saying that Indian troops had fired small arms across the Line of Control, killing two soldiers and injuring nine. The notion of surgical strike linked to alleged terrorists' bases is an illusion being deliberately generated by India to create false effects,"" the Pakistani military said in a statement.",1
War on Drugs Heading in Wrong Direction?,"License DMCA My guest today is Maya Schenwar, Truthout's editor-in-chief, author of Locked Down, Locked Out: Why Prison Doesn't Work and How We Can Do Better , and co-editor of Who Do You Serve, Who Do you Protect? Police Violence and Resistance in the United States . Joan Brunwasser: Welcome back to OpEdNews, Maya. We last spoke back in January, 2015. Now, I'd like to discuss your recent piece: Death Penalty for Heroin Dealers? More Proof the Drug War Is Not Over . Who thought the drug war was over in the first place and why? - Advertisement - Maya Schenwar: There has been a shift in mainstream politics toward condemning the drug war, and for good reason. It has done nothing to stem drug misuse, and meanwhile it has resulted in the criminalization and incarceration of millions of people, overwhelmingly Black and Brown people. With countless studies demonstrating its ""failure"" (I put this in quotes because I don't think the drug war was actually devised to help people in the first place), politicians who defend it end up looking pretty bad. So the current line is to say it's in the past, and that we have a new approach to drugs going forward. The Obama administration, many state governments, and even conservative politicians (including the ""Right on Crime"" crowd) have said that we need to leave behind the old war on drugs. In February, Eric Holder said the drug war is ""over,"" and Obama increasingly talks about treating drug-related issues as ""public health problems"" instead of criminal problems. JB: How does that change anything: the disproportionate numbers of minority members locked up for possession, more single moms incarcerated for the same, families split up and minors left with no parent at home? Are they, then, opening the prison gates and saying, ""We were wrong. This was all a big mistake; it didn't work and we diverted and wasted billions of dollars that could have been used to good purpose. And we ruined your lives for nothing. Oops. Sorry.""? MS: No, no one is opening the prison gates, unfortunately! There are some limited steps being taken toward scaling back drug-war-related incarceration. For example, Obama has issued hundreds of commutations to people serving super-long drug sentences. Some states have taken steps to reduce some very low-level drug offenses to misdemeanors instead of felonies, which means people are a lot less likely to be incarcerated for them. (California's Proposition 47 is an example of this, although the emphasis on ""low-level offenses"" has actually entrenched the idea that people should be severely punished for ""higher-level offenses.) - Advertisement - Obviously, in a number of states, marijuana is being decriminalized, and some are legalizing it. However, that doesn't mean there are no longer marijuana arrests -- in fact, an ACLU study released recently showed there were more marijuana possession arrests last year than arrests for all violent crimes. The study also showed that Black people are still disproportionately arrested in far greater numbers than white people, despite using marijuana at about the same rate as white people. JB: How do we understand this, Maya? Beyond being convinced that the whole penal system is seriously screwed up, what's the point of increased marijuana arrests? Is this a last gasp effort or at least partly to fill up jail cells and local or private prison coffers? MS: There wasn't an increase in marijuana arrests overall last year; there was a decrease. But obviously it was a small decrease, given that there was a larger number of possession arrests than all violent crime arrests. I don't think it's about filling private prison coffers. Ultimately, prisons are expensive for states, and I don't actually see money as a primary motivator to incarcerate people. Until we challenge criminality itself -- and challenge the white supremacy that underlies the US's version of criminality -- we won't be done with large-scale incarceration. We have to understand incarceration by looking at how people are being labeled as disposable and as ""dangerous,"" and how those things are racialized. Whether it's marijuana possession or something else, there will always be a convenient ""crime"" with which to charge Black and Brown people unless white supremacy itself is confronted. We also have to think about ableism, transmisogyny, patriarchy, economic injustice, capitalism -- really confronting the structures that make it possible for our society to lock millions of people in cages. If we look at the drug war through this lens, we understand that's it's not some stand-alone entity; it's one tool deployed by a larger power structure that continually targets marginalized people in order to keep itself going. JB: Good point. Does the fact that the penal dysfunction is part of a larger overarching dysfunction make it easier or harder to improve it? And what's ableism? I don't know that I'm familiar with that term. MS: I think the fact that it's part of an overarching structural problem means that it can't really been improved, per se -- it really has to be uprooted. I wouldn't say that can happen extremely easily; it's more a goal to move toward while making incremental changes. Ableism is the structural oppression against and devaluation of people with disabilities. One of the ways it plays out in relation to prison is the extremely high level of incarceration of people with psychiatric and intellectual disabilities. 'Locked Down, Locked Out: Why Prison Doesn't Work and How We Can Do Better' by Maya Schenwar(image by Berrett-Koehler Publishers) License DMCA JB: Quite true. I believe much of that shift occurred when President Reagan ""reallocated"" resources, closing many state mental hospitals and dumping the patients onto the streets and the unprepared public. And we've been paying the price, one way or another, ever since. What haven't we talked about yet? MS: There's of course much more to talk about, but we have to end things somewhere, right? One thing I'd caution people against is assuming that the automatic alternative to incarceration for people convicted of drug offenses should be drug treatment. First of all, most people arrested for drug offenses aren't dependent on drugs (most people who use drugs are not dependent on them); there are safe ways to use drugs and we have to challenge laws that stigmatize their use.",1
The U.S. National Bird Is Now a Drone,"(128 fans) - Advertisement - 
Officially, of course, the national bird of the United States is that half-a-peace-sign that Philadelphia sports fans like to hold up at opposing teams. But unofficially, the film National Bird has it right: the national bird is a killer drone. 
Finally, finally, finally, somebody allowed me to see this movie. And finally somebody made this movie. There have been several drone movies worth seeing , most of them fictional drama , and one very much worth avoiding ( Eye in the Sky ). But National Bird is raw truth, not entirely unlike what you might fantasize media news reports would be in a magical world in which media outlets gave a damn about human life. 
The first half of National Bird is the stories of three participants in the U.S. military's drone murder program, as told by them. And then, just as you're starting to think you'll have to write that old familiar review that praises how well the stories of the victims among the aggressors were told but asks in exasperation whether any of the victims of the actual missiles have any stories, National Bird expands to include just what is so often missing, and even to combine the two narratives in a powerful way. 
Heather Linebaugh wanted to protect people, benefit the world, travel, see the world, and use super cool technology. Apparently our society did not explain to her in time what it means to join the military. Now she suffers guilt, anxiety, moral injury, PTSD, sleep disorder, despair, and a sense of responsibility to speak out on behalf of friends, other veterans, who have killed themselves or become too alcoholic to speak for themselves. Linebaugh helped murder people with missiles from drones, and watched them die, and identified body parts or watched loved ones gather up body parts. 
Even while still in the Air Force, Linebaugh was on a suicide watch list and had a psychologist recommend moving her to a different sort of job, but the Air Force refused. She has episodes. She sees things. She hears things. But she's forbidden to discuss her work with friends or even with a therapist who doesn't have the proper ""security clearance."" 
We let Daniel down even more than Heather. He says he actually opposed militarism but was homeless and desperate, so he joined the military. We could have given him a house for much less than we paid him to help murder people at Fort Meade. 
Lisa Ling worked on a database filled by drone surveillance that compiled information on 121,000 ""targets"" in two years. Multiply that by a dozen years. With 90% of victims not among the targets, add up how many people would die in the targeting of the whole list. That'd be over 7 million. But it's not numbers that have poisoned the souls of these three veterans; it's children and mothers and brothers and uncles lying in pieces on the ground. 
Ling travels to Afghanistan to see the place at ground level and to meet with drone victims. She meets a little boy who lost his leg and his 4-year-old brother and his sister and his father. On February 2, 2010, drone ""pilots"" at Creech Air Base murdered 23 innocent members of one family. - Advertisement - 
The filmmakers have voices read the written transcript of what the drone operators said to each other before, during, and after sending in the missiles that did the damage. This is worse than Collateral Murder . The people whose job it is to identify children and others who should not be murdered have identified children among the group of people being targeted. The ""pilots"" at Creech are eager to reject this information and to get onto killing as many people as they can. Their lust for blood drives the decision process. Only after they've killed 23 people do they recognize children among the survivors, and the lack of guns. 
We see the bodies brought home to bury. Those injured describe their suffering, physical as well as mental. We see people being fitted with artificial legs. We hear Afghans describe their perception of drones. They imagine, just as many Americans may imagine, and just as viewers of Eye in the Sky would imagine, that drone operators have a clear, high resolution view of everything. In fact, they have a view of fuzzy little blobs on a computer screen that looks like it was created in the 1980s. 
Linebaugh says there is no way to distinguish the little ""civilian"" blobs from little ""militant"" blobs. When Daniel hears President Obama claim that there is always near certainty that no civilians will be killed, Daniel explains that such knowledge is simply not possible. Linebaugh says she was often on the side of the conversation telling the ""pilots"" at Creech not to murder innocents, but that they always pushed for permission to kill. 
Jesselyn Radack, attorney for whistleblowers, says in the film that the FBI told two whistleblowers that a terrorist group had put them on a kill list. She said that the FBI has also contacted Linebaugh's family and warned her that ""terrorists"" have been searching for her name online, suggesting that she fix this problem by shutting up. (She had written an op-ed in the Guardian ). 
The FBI also raids Daniel's house, arriving with 30 to 50 agents, badges, guns, cameras, and search warrants. They take away his papers, electronics, and phone. They tell him he is under investigation for a possible indictment under the Espionage Act. This is the World War I-era law for targeting foreign enemies that President Obama has made a routine of using to target domestic whistleblowers. While Obama has prosecuted more people under this law than did all previous presidents combined, we probably have no way of knowing how many people have been explicitly threatened with the possibility. - Advertisement - 
While we should be apologizing to, comforting, and aiding these young people rather than denying them the right to speak to anybody and threatening them with decades in prison, Lisa Ling did manage to find some kindness. Victims of drone strikes in Afghanistan told her that they forgave her. As the film ends, she's planning another trip to Afghanistan.

Google And God,"(16 fans) - Advertisement - Yeah. I know, I know. I'm an iconoclast. Yep and I'm proud of it. So the other day I got to thinking about religion and other things in the Homo Sapiens space called life. You know I get philosophical from time to time. And then I get inspired to tackle some very touchy and sensitive subjects that usually set off a lot of people. I get a perverse joy in rubbing people the wrong way and send them into WFT hissy fits. So you know that this article is going to have some folks seeing red and the God-police will start pulling out their truncheons to give me a whack on the ole noggin just to prove their point that I should not meddle in the affairs of the Great Father somewhere in a place called Heaven. The fact is that today, with the click of a mouse button the era of seeking answers and advice about God directly from rabbis, pastors, or imams is gradually coming to an end. And the cause of this backsliding and undermining of the hitherto unquestioned role of these ""emissaries of God on earth?"" Well, it's not a human person but Artificial Intelligence personified and its called ""Google."" Google may be the well-known supercomputer system that processes information by nano-seconds but AI has been with us for a long time. Consider the following: Self-driving cars have arrived; Siri (on your Iphones and Ipads) can listen to your voice and find the nearest movie theatre; and I.B.M. set the "" Jeopardy""- conquering Watson to work on medicine, initially training medical students, perhaps eventually helping in diagnosis. Nowadays, scarcely a week goes by without the announcement of a new A.I. product or technique. And for all the constant complaining about the religious right's inappropriate influence in politics and religious conservatives' attempts to tear down the church-state wall, the secular movement in America is actually doing quite well. The most recent Pew Research Center poll says 23 percent of Americans are religiously unaffiliated (atheists, agnostics and no-religion people); that percentage increases to 35 percent for Americans under thirty-five -- young people are not doing too many religious conversions, and see God as part of a belief system of their parents. So, for Americans in the Bible Belt and elsewhere this is alarming news - if secularism hasn't yet taken over the country, its on track for that to happen. And its all the fault of artificial intelligence as epitomized in the incredible superpower of Google . Now I do NOT intend to be dismissive of religion or disrespect people's beliefs OR their right to worship and believe what they want to. Me? I believe that every Thursday night when karaoke takes place in Brooklyn my bulldog Max turns into a werewolf seeking cats to relieve them of their hemoglobin fluids. You get my drift -- you can believe what you want but that does not make what you believe true. But one thing is not in doubt -- Google and God are on our daily human agendas. Indeed, the questions that Americans type into Google searches about God appear to confirm the country's rising secularism. For example, according to an economist writing in the New York Times : ""Despite the rising popularity of Pope Francis, who was elected in 2013, Google searches for churches are 15 percent lower in the first half of this decade than they were during the last half of the previous one. The top Google search including the word ""God"" is ""God of War,"" a videogame, with more than 700,000 searches per year."" Bummer, people searching for a videogame with the word ""God"" in it? WFT! Are people losing their cotton-picking minds? And to make matter worse the same economist, Stephens-Davidowitz, also discovered that ""Searches questioning God's existence are up."" He went further to seek what questions people Google whilst in their periods of doubt: The No. 1 question? In the United States of America? Is without a doubt: ""who created God?"" And the second? ""why God allows suffering?"" in number 3 ""why does God hate me? And in fourth place: ""why God needs so much praise?"" - Advertisement - It now appears from this data that people in America are looking to Google for answers to some pertinent and serious questions about God and in an oblique way questioning what they were taught by their parents and learned in churches on Sundays for so many years. There is absolutely no doubt that the Internet and Google have been at odds with religion. The Google phenomenon is also explainable in the context of the adversarial relationship between science and religion -- they just don't mix. Religion -- all religions -- are based on a system of blind, unquestioning belief and a rejection of objective inquiry that is substituted with faith. Religions place and validate this faith by statements found in their Holy Books that's interpreted by preachers, pastors, priests and ministers. These writings and teachings MUST be accepted without question by the faithful. Science on the other hand believes that ALL things in nature should be questioned and examined. And that it is only by this kind of objective inquiry that humankind has progressed and will progress. The Internet and Google are not the products of a Sunday sermon or the dogmatic faith or prayers of the faithful. Advances in medicine, communications technology, transportation, and other things that define modern human existence are the results of science -- not faith or belief. In fact, the cornerstone of the scientific method is to question everything; science accepts nothing that is not provable -- again and again and again. The rise of American secularism and of individuals with no religious affiliations is directly due to the rise and use of the Internet. Hitherto the Internet, and in particular Google , people used libraries and their church leaders for research on questions of faith, belief, and the existence of God. Religion had a stranglehold on knowledge and issues of God and Sin. But with the advent of Google information and knowledge became readily available and a new generation is now growing up in a society more open to doubting old canards and traditional belief systems. Google has undermined religion's central premise for the belief in God -- his all-knowing faculty. Google now processes over 40,000 search queries every second on average which translates to over 3.5 billion searches per day and 1.2 trillion searches per year worldwide. Google can bring up literally millions of hits SIMULTANEOUSLY on every conceivable topic that the human mind can imagine -- including Biblical history, origins and that of other religious books, and their pros and cons. For iconoclasts like me declining religious affiliation is akin to social improvement. It's evidence of the clarifying influence of scientific rationality that's the end result of the global information revolution. I know that one of the questions here will undoubtedly be about personal faith in the context of our ability to pay bills, order clothes and food, communicate with friends and family and send emails across the word in seconds. And too, I'll hear the issue of the difference between Google as a profit-making, altruistic organization, and the church whose primary concern is about the condition of our souls. These are valid arguments when it comes to God and Google. I'm not suggesting that this is an either or situation. But what I am suggesting is that modern experiences in the secular world are now impacting religious belief and not in a very positive manner. - Advertisement - And yes, from a religious standpoint the question is: because of the rise of Google are religious institutions that used to answer questions about God and Sin crowdsourcing the acts of faith that the entire system is built on? Put another way, does religion risk losing its ability to provide answers to life on earth when Google's data cannot do so? And, in today's Internet and Google dominated world will faithful people when in doubt, Google ""who created God?""",1

The following is a lengthy list of the entirety of the Podesta Emails database as released by Wikileaks (updated as of 10/24/14 through the 14th dump of records). It provides a quick graphic representation of the structure of the database (which is organized alphabetically by the sender [see the Introduction to the Guide: Navigating WikiLeaks: A Guide to the Podesta Emails ]). In particular this view, which contains a set of documents by the Alphabetical set (one for each letter and a PRE and POST category for the emails that fall prior to A and after Z), can show the gaps in the records thus far released. It is thus a useful tool to see whether a particular sender may be missing or what further emails from a particular sender have yet been released. This can be done using the colored bands - the DARK ORANGE band highlighting the as yet unreleased emails. Each of the other colored bands represents the data dumps from the 7th through the latest. The second to last column (dump) indicates which dump the email was released in. I will present an alphabetical list at the start which provides a direct link to a PDF version (links not active) and a SPREADSHEET version (active links if download Excel file [Viewable online but doesn't work if open in Google Sheets]). The links provide a link to the Wikileaks page (Link) and to directly download the .eml email file (Get). This will be followed by an image representation of the entire alphabetical list. Unfortunately due to the limitations on using table formatting I have chosen to use the image rather than the data itself on this page. Thus the user might find the PDF and/or SPREADSHEET useful. I will also provide the links to the PDF and SPREADSHEET above each alphabetical section.

Healthcare system bleeds us dry by design,"License DMCA The U.S. healthcare system is produced and fueled by crony capitalism. Activist investor Dave Chase bottom-lined the result ( Forbes ): ""the Middle Class is in a 20-year long economic depression that is at least 95% due to healthcare."" Studies show our healthcare industry is providing worse care than those of many other wealthy nations, at an astounding 50% per capita higher cost than the next most expensive nation. Ask the price of any service and you always receive the same answer: ""What insurance do you have?"" Billing is determined by how much can be extracted from each patient on a case-by-case basis, often when the patient is at his or her most vulnerable. By any definition, this is a predatory, non-competitive system. So-called price-transparency initiatives serve to perpetuate this system in which prices can vary by a factor of 100 for the exact same service performed by the same provider. Healthcare is the only consumer industry legally permitted to shield itself from the usual requirement of legitimate pricing and competition. Patients have been rendered powerless. Ethically, this is institutionalized fraud. To stop the bleeding, Congress need only require that healthcare providers publish ""legitimate pricing"", which means they can continue to set their own rates, but - a different rate for each patient - must be prohibited. Without legitimate pricing, price competition cannot exist and healthcare costs will continue to skyrocket. Consumer-protection laws are applied to virtually every other industry and require both that (i) prices be disclosed; and (ii) prices be stated in a common format. Gas is uniformly priced in gallons (not pints, quarts, ounces or liters). Food is generally priced in ounces and pounds and state agencies protect consumers by inspecting scales. Scores of regulation specify precisely how annual percentage rate must be calculated and disclosed in all credit transactions (i.e., the price of borrowed money). Healthcare's exemption from consumer-protection laws is a national disgrace. Healthcare providers, like other sellers of consumer and financial products, must be required to publish their rates in a uniform format such as industry-standard CPT codes or a percentage of Medicare rates. Every citizen would be empowered to search any medical procedure online and see pricing for all providers within X miles. It would be as easy and familiar as checking the price of any other goods or services. Legitimate prices mean networks will be obsolete, along with the administrative burdens, tremendous costs, and limitations on patient choice that they impose. Health insurance will function like homeowner's, fire or auto insurance. When a house burns down, the price of drywall and paint does not depend on whether the home was insured by State Farm or Allstate. Patients would buy health insurance providing a reimbursement level that they select; for example, 100% of Medicare rates. Consumers could shop every provider in the nation and easily determine their out-of-pocket costs. - Advertisement - High amounts of corporate debt have been incurred acquiring medical facilities on the assumption they could continue to impose predatory pricing. Disruption of current business models will lead to bankruptcies. Just as in all other industries, currently non-competitive providers will be acquired at low cost and be operated by more efficient providers. Ultimately, the industry will adjust to a competitive environment and offer health services at far lower prices. University of California researchers reported that a consumer-oriented incentive to generate competition, known as reference pricing , lowered hospital costs by more than 20% for the 1.3 million members (and their families) of the California Public Employees' Retirement System. The insurance plan stated the maximum amount it would pay for a group of common medical procedures, thereby incentivizing participants to shop prices. Lower-priced hospitals saw market share growth of 28 percent, prompting many higher-priced hospitals to lower their prices. Legitimate pricing would be a far more powerful stimulus to competition than mere reference pricing. Legitimate pricing would compel wide-open free-market competition and would, in this author's opinion, virtually overnight reduce U.S. health expenditures by a minimum 33%. Disposable incomes and prosperity would boom. The U.S. deficit would shrink. Lower underlying healthcare prices is the sole and exclusive way to materially lower health-insurance premiums. Anyone who says otherwise is, to be kind, incorrect. Reform is difficult because the healthcare industry spends more on lobbying than the defense, aerospace, and the oil-and-gas industries combined . The American public understands our predatory pricing system is morally and economically unjustifiable and is demanding change. A Petition to End Predatory Healthcare Pricing and to require legitimate pricing rapidly gained more than 100,000 signatures this year. - Advertisement - To the many polarized groups in our nation, we have added free-market versus single-payer devotees. While this author takes no position on this issue, legitimate pricing is an essential prerequisite to either system. Nobody knows what prices would look like in an open market. For example, a study by The Department of Health and Human Services compared Medicare-allowable prices for lab charges to the negotiated prices paid for 20 high-volume and high-expense lab tests by health insurers. While providers generally complain that Medicare rates are too stingy, the study found that prices paid by Medicare exceeded fair market value: ""Medicare could have saved $910 million, or 38 percent, on these lab tests if it had paid providers at the lowest established rate in each geographic area."" In the absence of legitimate pricing, bureaucrats administering single-payer would have no basis on which to negotiate or set rates. That will likely leave lobbyists in control of pricing. For many Americans this concept evokes memories like the Pentagons purchase of $1,000 hammers and toilet seats. If we didn't know how much those items cost in hardware stores (i.e., legitimate prices), there would be no reference point and nobody would have even batted an eye. To reverse our nation's financial bleeding and end restrictions on patient choice resulting from restricted provider networks, Congress must empower citizens by mandating legitimate healthcare pricing.",1
Throwing off the shackles,"Headlined to H3 10/26/16 - Advertisement - Philippines president Duterte announces 'separation' from US during China visit Philippines President Rodrigo Duterte announced his 'separation' from the United States, expressing his desire for the Philippines to become more dependent ... License DMCA 
Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte in Beijing, China announcing separation from the United States Considering US belligerence in the world particularly since 9/11, the idea of a countries elected leader standing up and defying the US hyper power is something to behold. The latest leader to exercise his countries right of sovereignty is Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte. Duterte speaking during a state visit to Beijing, China announced, ""Your honors, in this venue, I announce my separation from the United States...both in military and economics also"".[1] He said, ""America has lost"" while announcing a new alliance the Philippines, China and Russia, ""there are three of us against the world"". Of course Duterte is not the first leader to poke his middle finger at the US imperialist. Fidel Castro did it with Cuba in 1959, as did Hugo Chavez in Venezuela in 1999. Two at least who spoke truth to power, put his people first at great risk to himself when they separated their country from US hegemony over them, survived many US attempts to undermine or assassinate and overthrow them. There's too many others to mention here that didn't survive or were overthrown in CIA initiated coups, color revolutions, regime change et al. Is this somehow subversive coming from an American extolling foreign leaders that have defied the US? Or is it an acknowledgement that we, the US, can't dictate to the world. That it's a countries elected leaders purpose to exercise his judgment to do right by his people, follow an independent course to best serve his people, not be subservient and dictated to by the US. If the people disagree with such a leader they can elect someone else or impeach him for felonious behavior. Maybe that's a bit naive, too ideal for the complex world we live in today. - Advertisement - But we as a country have completely lost our way, been an imperialist bully, initiating illegal wars and occupations, aggression against countries that are no threat, imminent or otherwise to America. Authorized torture, indefinite detention, extraordinary rendition, kill innocents in drone strikes and missile attacks, order the targeted assassination of anyone, anywhere, including American citizens if the president alone so decides. Initiate coups and regime change against any country that defies the US while conducting surveillance of ALL electronic communications of everyone in the world. This is not the behavior of a country capable of having mutual respect for others particularly those countries taking an independent course and not bowing to US diktat. We Americans can close our eyes, pretend or ignore what we have become; a rogue actor on the world stage. Yes rogue. What gave us the right to be the ""indispensible country"", exceptional, entitled, run roughshod against any leader-Putin being the leader now most demonized in US crosshairs. As for the Philippines, we took it as well as Cuba and Puerto Rico; booty from Spain in the aftermath of the Spanish American war of 1898. - Advertisement - Of course earlier in our countries inglorious history we stole much of what is now California, Texas and the southwest from Mexico while committing genocide and stealing most of the arable and tribal lands of the indigenous native peoples all in the name of ""manifest destiny"", as if it was some benign, natural, yet inexorable happenstance. Yeah right. Let's admit it. Today we're the beneficiaries of our countries earlier ""successful"" aggression against the indigenous peoples as well as a country built on slavery; peoples the government has never formally apologized to. We can ignore the truth of this aggressive history, believe it to have been the inevitable consequence overthrowing British colonialism and ridding the country of what the government and most white people then referred to as Indian ""savages"". Then later came the masses of millions of mostly European immigrants; those ancestors who came to America, a consequence of repression, lack of opportunity, religious intolerance they suffered in their native countries. And with them the American demographic changed forever from its colonial past. So now we're a mass of different peoples, mostly adapted to our earlier British colonial heritage, ""connected"" to those who threw off British tyranny, declared their independence, formed a union and soon thereafter a formal constitution of rights under the rule of law. A country that began not wanting to engage in foreign entanglements, fiercely independent, embracing the protestant work ethic, most probably considered inward looking by today's standards. It feels quaint, distant, a different sort of people than most in America now.",1
Newt Gingrich goes berserk when Fox News Megyn Kelly referred to Trump as a sexual predator,"License DMCA 
In an explosive interview, Newt Gingrich became completely unhinged, verbally attacking Fox News' Megyn Kelly for referring to Trump as a sexual predator. Throughout the interview, Newt Gingrich seemed to live in an alternate state of reality. He continued to discount polls that show Trump losing badly. He refused to acknowledge that all the tossup states are moving towards Clinton. 
The interview was already contentious when a couple of words from Megyn Kelly turned it explosive. (Video here .) 
""You want to know why Trump has had a rough time?"" Newt Gingrich asked. 
""If Trump is a sexual predator,"" Megyn Kelly said. ""That is ..."" - Advertisement - 
""He is not a sexual predator,"" Newt Gingrich shouted. 
""That's your opinion,"" Kelly said. ""I am not taking a position on it."" 
""You could not defend that statement,"" an unhinged Gingrich shouted. ""Now I am sick and tired of people like you, using language that's inflammatory, that's not true."" 
""Excuse me Mr. Speaker,"" Kelly interjected. ""You have no idea whether it is true or not. What we know is that at least ..."" 
""Neither do you,"" Gingrich shouted. - Advertisement - 
""That's right,"" Kelly replied. ""And I am not taking a position on it unlike you. So what I said is incorrect?"" 
""Yes you are,"" Gingrich replied. ""When you use the words you took a position. And that is very unfair of you Megyn. I think that is exactly the bias people are upset by."" 
""I think that your defensiveness on this may speak volumes, sir,"" Kelly replied. ""What I said is if -- no, no, no, -- let me make my point and then I will give you the floor. What I said is if Trump is a sexual predator, then it is a big story. And what we saw on that tape was Trump himself saying that he likes to grab women by the genitals and kiss them against their will. That's what we saw. Then we saw ten women come forward after he denied actually doing it at the debate to say that was untrue. 'He did it to me. He did it to me.' We saw reporters. We saw people who had worked with him; people from Apprentice and so on and so forth. He denies it all, which is his right. We don't know what the truth is. My point to you is, as a media story we don't get to say the ten women are lying. We have to cover that story, sir."" 
Gingrich then went into full spin mode. He attempted to characterize the media as biased for covering more about the growing Trump sexual predator scandal than Clinton speeches to banks, a false equivalency. He then unleashed his anger and abuse again.",1
Election 2016 Endgame: Vote!,"License DMCA We're getting down to the wire. It's been a tough haul. Actually, the campaign season has felt endless. But now is not the time to drop the ball. In the days remaining, it is essential to motivate other voters who may be sitting on the fence -- or are too disgusted -- to go to the polls about why that option is not viable. Actually, it's dangerous. Their voices are crucial. Personally, it's hard for me to understand how the issue of climate change can be put on the back burner by any American. Maybe I feel the urgency so deeply because I have been writing about the environment for five years. Okay, and the mother thing definitely kicks in; wanting to protect my kid, other people's kids, and future generations. Still... it goes beyond that. It's about the birds that are dying, the wildfires ignited by droughts, the chemicals in water that was previously used for fracking and are now irrigating our country's fruits and vegetables. It encompasses the flooding, record temperatures, the lack of environmental justice for those who live in low-income communities, and the famines causing mass migration. Every time I write an article, it's with the hope of putting a spotlight on a concern folks may not know about. I hope someone new is ""going to get it."" - Advertisement - It's tough when you are up against the big-money boys of the fossil-fuel industry and their supporters like the Koch brothers (who have their fingers in everything from Grand Canyon National Park to campaign funding). Yup, your state's Attorney General, who is elected and tasked with being the ""People's Lawyer,"" may be one of those people who have received money to jump on the lawsuit to derail the Clean Power Plan. Most of the media has dropped the ball on featuring stories on climate change and its ramifications. When guests appear on shows spouting disinformation, most interviewers don't push back. News stories with hard scientific facts don't get traction because they may not be ""sexy."" Well, there's nothing sexy about extreme weather. Just ask people who have been the victims of hurricanes, including New York City and environs. Homes destroyed, businesses wrecked, Manhattan subways deluged with water. Unfortunately, too many Americans still don't get how climate change is the catalyst behind the challenges -- both now and in the future -- for America's health, economy, and national security. It can be hard to hear that message when ads pushed by the American Petroleum Institute and individual oil companies (like Chevron and Exxon) are busy promoting the agenda that Americans have no choice except to choose between a robust economy and clear air. - Advertisement - Okay, I'm not naĂÂŻve enough to expect the fossil-fuel industry to elevate the conversation about renewable energy. They don't want to promote what the growth of a green economy has to offer in terms of building a viable new job sector, that can implement change and employ workers. Donald Trump has made outrageous statements about the environment. Both he and Mike Pence are on the record as being climate deniers. Oh, and Trump wants to get rid of the EPA. Great. With no regulations on the table, big polluters will be able to get away with toxic dumping the same way Trump ""legally"" avoided paying taxes (see "" Halliburton Loophole ""). Who will suffer? Not the Exxon executive who didn't want fracking in his backyard . It will fall to everyday Americans who be unaware of the toxins in the air, chemicals in the products they buy and ingest, unborn children at risk in the womb, and low-income communities and people of color who live daily without environmental justice. The list goes on.",1
An Outrageous Merger,"It's outrageous that AT&T and Time Warner may be permitted to merge. Of course, there are antitrust issues. If it's approved, some competitors will go out of business, others won't get started, and consumers will pay more and get less. Antitrust law is not designed to regulate anticompetitive behavior; it is designed to prevent anticompetitive behavior. Permitting AT&T to acquire Time Warner would be like giving a small boy a ball and then saying, ""Now don't bounce it"" -- or hiring someone to watch him. Regulation doesn't work. What's called ""agency capture"" is widespread and well documented. In the BP oil-spill case, it involved the regulators literally sleeping with the regulated. Even if an agency isn't captured it probably doesn't have enough personnel to do meaningful regulation. The FCC of my day had three employees to respond to 85,000 complaints, and they travelled in pairs. - Advertisement - The only way to prevent anticompetitive corporate behavior is to forbid the mergers that make it possible. But antitrust law and lawyers often have ways of finding adequate competition when no one else can see it. Moreover, the serious antitrust issues and economic impact of this proposed merger are the least of our concerns. Mergers of media firms, unlike those in other industries, raise issues involving our democracy, analogous to those associated with the First Amendment. Some involve politics and governing. Major media owners are more politically powerful than major donors. When a single owner has dominant control of newspapers, radio, television and cable systems within a state or region it can affect elections. When a weapons manufacturer also owns a network, it creates an appearance of possible conflict in its war coverage. Other issues involve the creative community. Suppose a single corporation owns movie studios, theaters, a TV network, book publishers, newspapers, and other forms of media. It can favor its movies in its theaters, make its authors guests on its TV shows, and advertise all its products in its newspapers. - Advertisement - Both AT&T and Time Warner are among the world's largest corporations. Time Warner's HBO and Cinemax programming is sold in 150 countries, its Turner programs in 200. AT&T is the largest telecommunications company in the world, also in 200 countries. Both are holding companies, conglomerates, that together own dozens of corporations. Many are known to you, like CNN, HBO, or DirectTV. Check their corporate Web pages for more. Worst of all, and what ought to absolutely preclude this merger, they will represent a gigantic combination of programming and delivery (""content and conduit"") -- the ultimate chokehold on the distribution of a diversity of content. The AT&T of old only provided distribution, the conduit. Everyone was entitled to a phone. And once you got one, you could send any ideas you wanted into that phone and through AT&T's lines. Other institutions might come after you for disclosing national-security secrets, fraudulent marketing, or defamation, but not AT&T. There was a legal ""right of entry"" into the old AT&T network. No longer. There will be no legal rights for America's creators of content. Nor will there be a financial incentive for AT&T to carry their content.",1
What Does It Take to Survive Where You Live?,"License DMCA 
How much does it take to get by where you live? A new report concludes that current federal minimum wage of $7.25 per hour doesn't come close, anywhere in the United States. It takes more than $15 per hour to earn a living wage in most states. When you throw in the rising cost of student debt, low-income Americans are even further underwater. 
The report, "" Waiting for the Payoff: How Low Wages and Student Debt Keep Prosperity Out of Reach (pdf),"" was issued this week by the People's Action Institute. Among its findings: 
* It takes more than $15 per hour to earn a living wage in 42 states and the District of Columbia. That figure is over $16 in more than half of the country, comes to nearly $20 per hour in California, and is more than $20 in New York state. 
* New York State's minimum wage of $9 per hour provides only 44 percent of a living wage for a single adult and less than a quarter of the living wage for a single adult with two children."" 
* Arkansas had the lowest hourly rate of any state, but at $14.58 per hour it was barely below the $15 per hour minimum proposed by Fight for 15 . - Advertisement - 
* The situation is even more dire for working parents. A single adult with two children needs more than $26 per hour to get by in South Carolina, more than $41 per hour in New York state, and nearly $44 per hour in Washington DC. 
* 43 states and Washington, D.C. have a lower minimum wage for tipped workers. Half of tipped workers are 30 years old or older, and tipped workers are three times as likely as other workers to be impoverished. 
What's the price of a dream? For people who saw college as the way to a better life, this country's student debt crisis offers a harsh answer. More than 43 million Americans now carry some level of student debt. 
Student loan debt in this country now totals more than $1.3 trillion -- and it's getting worse. Common Dreams' Deirdre Fulton points to a new study from the Institute of College Access and Success which shows that the average undergraduate borrower now graduates with $30,100 in debt, a 4 percent increase from last year's figure. 
Living wage figures rise even higher when the cost of student debt is factored in. The national median payment for student debt comes to $242 per month. Student debt cost increases the national average living wage from $17.28 to $18.67 per hour. - Advertisement - 
College graduates typically earn higher wages, but the discrimination faced by women and people of color contributes to ongoing wage inadequacy. For example, African Americans are considerably more likely to take on student debt that white Americans, and are more likely to go to higher-cost private institutions. Women and people of color are more likely to work in tipped occupations, so the sub-minimum wage affects these groups disproportionately. 
Wage discrimination is also a critical problem, both for student debt holders and low-wage workers as a whole. As the report notes: 
""... Majors with a high proportion of white males, such as computer and information sciences, see starting salaries of $65,000. At the same time, English and Psychology, which see more women and people of color, have median starting salaries of $35,000 and $32,750 per year, respectively -- lower even than the traditional living wage for a single adult."" 
Discrimination in hiring and other systemic problems take a heavy toll. For each dollar paid to white male college graduates with degrees, black men are paid 78 cents; Latinos are paid 81 cents; black women are paid 72 cents; and Latinas are paid 69 cents.",1
Does The Russian Government Have A Reality Disconnect?,"License DMCA 
During the decades-long Cold War the belief in America was that the Soviet Union had an ideology of world domination. Every nationalist movement, such as Vietnam's effort to throw off French colonialism, was misinterpreted as another domino falling to Soviet world conquest. This mistaken American belief persisted despite Stalin's purge of the Trotsky elements that preached world revolution. Stalin declared: ""socialism in one country."" 
As the Soviets did not have the aim that the US attributed to them, the two governments could cooperate in reducing the dangerous tensions that nuclear weapons presented. 
The rise of the American neoconservatives and their doctrine of US world hegemony has given the United States the expansionist ideology formerly attributed to the Soviets. Only this time the expansionist ideology is real. Yet, Russia's foreign minister, Lavrov, said today that ""we [the US and Russia] have no ideological differences which make the Cold War inevitable."" - Advertisement - 
The inability of the Russian government to understand that the neoconservative ideology of US world hegemony is the driving force of US foreign policy leaves Lavrov puzzled at the high level of hostility toward Russia. As Lavrov believes that there are no ideological differences between the two countries, he doesn't understand the hostility. However, he does understand that this hostility toward Russia is a negation of Cold War rules that both countries avoid surprising the other with what could be perceived as a dangerous threat. 
There is no sign that the US government understands the danger in Russia's perception of threat -- or that Washington cares. - Advertisement -",1

Donald Trump has long campaigned on the promise of running the country the way he's run his businesses. On that basis, we essentially already know what it would mean if he entered the Oval Office and applied his personal business acumen to this nation (and the rest of the world). There's a surprisingly full record to cite. Who can forget, for instance, what happened to his signature gambling resorts in Atlantic City? Who can forget their serial failures in what was still relatively good times in that city, including the repeated trips to bankruptcy court and the way he stiffed local contractors and suppliers, running them out of business? As Russ Buettner and Charles Bagli of the New York Times summed it up : ""He put up little of his own money, shifted personal debts to the casinos and collected millions of dollars in salary, bonuses, and other payments. The burden of his failures fell on investors and others who had bet on his business acumen."" 
In his pre-political years, he perfected what Kurt Eichenwald of Newsweek dubbed ""the art of the bad deal"": ""lost contracts, bankruptcies, defaults, deceptions, and indifference to investors."" And from every bad deal for those who supported him, he's almost always walked away better off. All in all, it's quite a record (and don't even mention Trumped Up University ). There is no reason to believe that this pattern of behavior would change in the White House. After all, The Donald's record shows a remarkable consistency, so it's possible to imagine with a fair degree of accuracy what you're going to get. 
Take election night 2012 when The Donald was still a Mitt Romney supporter. CNN recently reported on his tweets that night and judging by his comment on the Chinese invention of climate change, his complaints about polling violations, his outburst about ""sham"" elections, and in the wake of Romney's loss his call for ""revolution,"" there hasn't been much truly new under the Trumpian sun in 2016 -- not even his last tweet of that night four years ago: ""We have to make America great again!"" In other words, his record should be considered remarkably predictive. So count on this: from the Oval Office, he'll walk away a richer man, leaving the rest of us holding the bag, and his supporters, particularly white working class men, in a striking version of hell. 
Then, of course, there's the other candidate. You know who -- the woman who never saw a bank CEO she couldn't get a couple of hundred thousand dollars from for giving thoroughly unsurprising speeches. Today, TomDispatch regular Nomi Prins, author of All the Presidents' Bankers , explores what our world might be like if The Donald goes down in flames and Hillary Clinton enters the White House next January.

Waking Up in Hillary Clinton's America Wall Street in the Saddle By Nomi Prins 
As this endless election limps toward its last days, while spiraling into a bizarre duel over vote-rigging accusations, a deep sigh is undoubtedly in order. The entire process has been an emotionally draining, frustration-inducing, rage-inflaming spectacle of repellent form over shallow substance. For many, the third debate evoked fatigue. More worrying, there was again no discussion of how to prevent another financial crisis, an ominous possibility in the next presidency, whether Donald Trump or Hillary Clinton enters the Oval Office -- given that nothing fundamental has been altered when it comes to Wall Street's practices and predation. 
At the heart of American political consciousness right now lies a soul-crushing reality for millions of distraught Americans: the choices for president couldn't be feebler or more disappointing. On the one hand, we have a petulant, vocabulary-challenged man-boar of a billionaire, who hasn't paid his taxes, has regularly left those supporting him holding the bag , and seems like a ludicrous composite of every bad trait in every bad date any woman has ever had. On the other hand, we're offered a walking photo-op for and well-paid speechmaker to Wall-Street CEOs, a one-woman money-raising machine from the 1% of the 1%, who, despite a folksiness that couldn't look more rehearsed, has methodically outplayed her opponent. - Advertisement - 
With less than two weeks to go before E-day -- despite the Trumptilian upheaval of the last year -- the high probability of a Clinton win means the establishment remains intact. When we awaken on November 9th, it will undoubtedly be dawn in Hillary Clinton's America and that potentially means four years of an economic dystopia that will (as would Donald Trump's version of the same) leave many Americans rightfully anxious about their economic futures. 
None of the three presidential debates suggested that either candidate would have the ability (or desire) to confront Wall Street from the Oval Office. In the second and third debates, in case you missed them, Hillary didn't even mention the Glass-Steagall Act, too big to fail, or Wall Street. While in the first debate, the subject of Wall Street only came up after she disparaged the tax policies of "" Trumped-up, trickle down economics "" (or, as I like to call it, the Trumpledown economics of giving tax and financial benefits to the rich and to corporations). 
In this election, Hillary has crafted her talking points regarding the causes of the last financial crisis as weapons against Trump, but they hardly begin to tell the real story of what happened to the American economy. The meltdown of 2007-2008 was not mainly due to ""tax policies that slashed taxes on the wealthy"" or a ""failure to invest in the middle class,"" two subjects she has repeatedly highlighted to slam the Republicans and their candidate. It was a byproduct of the destruction of the regulations that opened the way for a too-big-to-fail framework to thrive. Under the presidency of Bill Clinton, Glass-Steagall, the Depression-era act that once separated people's bank deposits and loans from any kind of risky bets or other similar actions in which banks might engage, was repealed under the Financial Modernization Act of 1999. In addition, the Commodity Futures Modernization Act was passed, which allowed Wall Street to concoct devastating unregulated side bets on what became the subprime crisis. 
Given that the people involved with those choices are still around and some are still advising (or in the case of one former president living with) Hillary Clinton, it's reasonable to imagine that, in January 2017, she'll launch the third term of Bill Clinton when it comes to financial policy, banks, and the economy. Only now, the stakes are even higher, the banks larger, and their impunity still remarkably unchallenged. 
Consider President Obama's current treasury secretary, Jack Lew. It was Hillary who hit the Clinton Rolodex to bring him back to Washington. Lew first entered Bill Clinton's White House in 1993 as special assistant to the president. Between his stints working for Clinton and Obama, he made his way into the private sector and eventually to Wall Street -- as so many of his predecessors had done and successors would do. He scored a leadership role with Citigroup during the time that Bill Clinton's former Treasury Secretary (and former Goldman Sachs co-Chairman ) Robert Rubin was on its board of directors. In 2009 , Hillary selected him to be her deputy secretary of state. - Advertisement - 
Lew is hardly the only example of the busy revolving door to power that led from the Clinton administration to the Obama administration via Wall Street (or activities connected to it). Bill Clinton's Treasury Under Secretary for International Affairs , Timothy Geithner worked with Robert Rubin, later championed Wall Street as president and CEO of the New York Federal Reserve while Hillary was senator from New York (representing Wall Street), and then became Obama's first treasury secretary while Hillary was secretary of state . 
One possible contender for treasury secretary in a new Clinton administration would be Bill Clinton's Under Secretary of Domestic Finance and Obama's Commodity Futures Trading Commission chairman, Gary Gensler (who was -- I'm sure you won't be shocked -- a Goldman Sachs partner before entering public service). These, then, are typical inhabitants of the Clinton inner circle and of the political-financial corridors of power. Their thinking, like Hillary's, meshes well with support for the status quo in the banking system, even if, like her, they are willing on occasion to admonish it for its ""mistakes."" 
This thru-line of personnel in and out of Clinton World is dangerous for most of the rest of us, because behind all the ""talking heads"" and genuinely amusing Saturday Night Live skits about this bizarre election lie certain crucial issues that will have to be dealt with: decisions about climate change, foreign wars, student-loan unaffordability, rising income inequality , declining social mobility , and, yes, the threat of another financial crisis. And keep in mind that such a future economic meltdown isn't an absurdly long-shot possibility. Earlier this year, the Federal Reserve, the nation's main bank regulator, and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation , the government entity that insures our bank deposits, collectively noted that seven of our biggest eight banks -- Citigroup was the exception -- still have inadequate emergency plans in the event of another financial crisis.",1
Who Can Compete in Our Elections?,"opednews.com - Advertisement - 
In the last two articles of this series we described the makeup of voters and considered the likely outcomes under a variety of different voting systems. Here we will repeat that thought-experiment but consider a different makeup of the voter attitudes. 
In the chart below, the results for the various voting systems are shown for both systems, serving both as a review and as a preview. But more importantly, the chart illustrates the difference between traditional voting systems and balanced ones. It is worth noting that in the traditional column, only Celeb (celebrity) candidates are competitive whereas in the balanced column the non-celebrity (Ghost) candidate is consistently at least competitive. Who Has a Chance of Winning(image by Paul Cohen) License DMCA 
Clearly, by these results, the balanced systems tend to be open to more candidates, and sometimes different candidates, than traditional systems. The difference stems from the fact that balanced voting systems consciously take into account both support and opposition of candidates -- whereas traditional systems only consider support. 
This election is between three candidates, two of whom are celebrities, well known by nearly all voters. Al Celeb has strong support from 35% of voters but is strongly disliked by 60%. Beth Celeb is strongly supported by 33% of the voters but very much disliked by 52%. The other candidate, Ghost, draws his support from the 12% of voters, who disapprove both of the Celeb candidates. Ghost is well regarded by the relatively small number of voters who know much about him. 
You might now take some time to think about which of the four candidates deserve to win the election. 
If the election were held using plurality voting, it is pretty clear that Al Celeb would be the winner with 35% of the vote. The fact that both Celeb candidates have more opposition than support does not matter because opposition is not a factor in traditional voting systems like plurality voting. 
On the other hand, if the election were held using balanced plurality voting , then presumably 35% of the voters would vote for Al Celeb and 33% would vote for Beth Celeb. But each of the Celeb candidates will face opposition votes as well. Al Celeb might have as much as 60% of voters casting votes against him, or as few as 48% against him if all 12% of voters who favor Al Ghost choose to vote for Ghost. So Al Celeb will have a net vote of somewhere between -13% and -35% of the voters. By the same reasoning, Beth Celeb will receive a net vote between -7% and -19% of the vote. Ghost, with between 0% and 12% of the vote will win the election. When opposition to them is taken into account, celebrity candidates lose their great advantage. - Advertisement - 
With approval voting , Al Celeb and Beth Celeb will respectively get 35% and 33% of the vote while Ghost will get only 12%. As with plurality voting, Al Celeb will be declared the winner. 
With balanced approval voting , (where the voter is asked to indicate approval or disapproval -- or neither - for each of the candidates), Al Celeb and Beth Celeb will respectively get -25% and -19% of the vote while Ghost will get 12% so Ghost will be declared the winner. 
In this election there are few enough candidates that one might question the motivation for using ration voting , but for the sake of providing an example we can consider it nonetheless. Each voter would be handed three plurality ballots (it could be more or less than that, but three seems reasonable with just three candidates). It seems likely that a Ghost voter would cast all three ballots for Ghost, giving Ghost 12% of the vote. But Al Celeb and Beth Celeb would respectively receive 35% and 33% of the vote. Al Celeb would be declared the winner. However, if sentiment among Ghost voters favored Beth Celeb over Al Celeb then some might cast some of their ballots for Beth Celeb and this could turn Beth Celeb into the winner. 
If this election were held using balanced ration voting, each voter would be handed three balanced plurality ballots. Any outcome is possible for this election, the voters have free reign to decide. This may not immediately obvious to you -- it was not to me. I had to set up a spread-sheet to try out scenarios to see this to be the case. 
It is the Ghost voters who will make the selection between the two Celeb candidates and that will be by deciding how many of their 12% of ballots will go to Celeb candidates. If 2% more of those 12% are cast against Al Celeb than are cast against Beth then the race between the Celeb candidates is a tie. Of course if more than 2% go against Al Celeb then he will lose and the contest will be between Ghost and Beth Celeb. If that margin is less than 2% then the contest will be between Ghost and Al Celeb. - Advertisement - 
Also as might be expected, whether Ghost can win will depend on how many of the Celeb voters decide to vote against the candidate they dislike (rather than for the Celeb candidate they like). If 23% of voters (Celeb voters) decide to cast votes against the Celeb candidate they dislike then the race becomes a toss-up. 
It is worth mentioning that voters will likely make these decisions according to their real feelings. They will cast votes against a candidate they dislike and they will vote for candidates they like. With balanced voting methods, voters can freely express dislike for particular candidates and that means they are not forced to resort to strategic methods to express this very real and very natural belief. 
With IRV , Celeb voters are likely to put the candidate they favor in first place on their ballots. Ghost will garner at most 12% of the vote, so Ghost will be eliminated in the first round of counting. Now the Ghost voters may all decide to not even list a second choice since that would mean voting for a candidate they dislike. The choice between the two Celeb candidates lies in the hands of these Ghost voters who do not like either of them. If just a little more than 2% more voters (necessarily these would be Ghost voters) list Beth Celeb as a second choice than those who list Al Celeb as second choice then that would give the election to Beth Celeb rather than to Al Celeb. Under IRV, the Ghost supporters would be well advised to give some serious consideration to whom they consider the lesser of the two evils. As with other traditional systems, with IRV a little-known candidate does not stand a ghost of a chance and the only real choice is apt to be between two celebrities. 
With IRBV , voters have more freedom of expression. Might any voters decide to cast their first priority against some candidate? Since there will be only two counts of the votes, some Celeb voters may well choose to cast their first-ranked choice as a vote against the Celeb they dislike. Presumably they would do that if they preferred Ghost to win rather than letting the wrong Celeb candidate winning. If enough voters choose to vote against one or the other of the Celeb candidates then Ghost actually could survive to the second round of voting and if a preference for Ghost by the voters whose Celeb candidate lost in the first round then it is quite possible for Ghost to become the winner. Under IRBV, this race is wide open with any of the three candidates having a chance to win.",1
ObamaCare: Things Fall Apart,"Headlined to H3 10/26/16 - Advertisement - 
The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, aka ""ObamaCare,"" was intended to dramatically increase the number of Americans with health coverage while ""bending the cost curve"" (that is, reducing the expected increases in price over time). 
The plan managed the first goal, at least in the short term. Unsurprising, isn't it, that more people get coverage when the law requires them to buy it, penalizes those who won't, and subsidizes those who can't afford to? 
But the progress on that metric is beginning to disintegrate and we're moving in the other direction. Bloomberg reports that 1.4 million Americans in 32 states will lose the health plans they now have next year as major providers pull out of the ObamaCare ""exchanges"" because they're losing money. Apaprently a business has to take in more than it spends if it wants to remain a going concern. I'm sure I've read that somewhere. 
As far as ""bending the cost curve"" is concerned ... well ... according to the US Department of Health and Human Services, cited by US News & World Report , average premiums rose by 7.5% last year and will rise by 25% in 2017. Price inflation for most consumer goods over the 2015-2016 period averaged a little more than 1%. Forgive me for thinking that when costs increase at 7-25 times the rate of inflation, that's not really a lot of ""bend"" to the ""curve."" 
In 2009, I described (the then notional, yet to be passed into law) ObamaCare as ""[g]overnment feeds you to the insurance companies, while simultaneously feeding the insurance companies to you. The state takes home a doggie bag."" Which is about the size of it, and I was far from the only person who noticed and warned that the plan not only wouldn't work, but COULDN'T work, if the goal was reducing costs and increasing access to health care. Artificially increasing demand relative to supply can only have the opposite effects. 
Since 2010, Republicans (who, by the way, first proposed the ""individual mandate"" scheme) have slowly but surely retreated from the idea of repealing ObamaCare and replacing it with nothing, instead proposing various schemes for keeping government as involved as possible in health care while pretending to ""return"" it to ""the free market"" (there hasn't been a free market in health care for more than a century, since the American Medical Association got licensing schemes imposed by the states so that it could limit the number of doctors and thereby keep their salaries high). - Advertisement - 
Most Americans are now worse off vis a vis health care than they were six years ago. The only winners have been government health bureaucrats. And unfortunately, the politicians don't seem to be interested in getting out of the way and letting the market fix things. Next stop: ""Single payer."" - Advertisement -",1
"Hillary, The Political Scientist","Happy Birthday, Hillary. You were destined to great things. And you knew it. *** I am astounded . I graduated in political science from the University of Naples, the university of Saint Thomas Aquinas, Giambattista Vico, and Benedetto Croce, in something like the 750 th graduating class; I have tried to keep up with the field as much as I could, even though I have preferred to concentrate on economics and political economy. I have always gotten along with the assumption that politics is ""the art of the possible."" But, let us give a good look at it. What is in this formula, if not a put down; a downgrading, so downgrading, characterization of this noble science? No wonder politics has become the art of bickering; the art of discord; the art of grasping at reefs, while we are drowning in perilous waters. No wonder, politics in the United States and much around the world has become polarized between two factions that fight for supremacy to the death. Not the death of the political class, but to the psychological and physical death of millions of people--in this country, the richest of the countries, the last best hope for mankind. Let alone the millions overseas. No wonder both the right and the left are focused on this set of policies: ""Deny them their rights; take their dignity away; give them a warm soup in a cold winter night; and go to sleep in peace.""

These are the words, not of Hillary of today or yesterday. These are the words of a young woman who breaks with tradition at the stodgy prestigious Wellesley College and becomes the first valedictorian in the history of that college. This is Hillary who is called to lead her class, not via invitation by academicians or administrators at Wellesley, but by her classmates who recognized the force of her leadership. This is Hillary Rodham, later to become Clinton, who throws away her prepared speech and delivers her oration extemporaneously: ""Politics is not the art of the possible"" politics is the art of making the impossible"" possible."" This is Hillary who is immediately recognized in the national press as a force of nature: woman's nature.

Wait a Minute! Is Early Voting Part of Campaigning?,"(39 fans) - Advertisement - 
We've long had early voting - by a few days, as I recall. And this wasn't something people were prompted to do. Voting License DMCA 
In most 'democratic' countries, campaigning stops twenty-four hours before an election, and during the election, exit polls are not broadcast until very late in the day. 
This year, for the first time, I believe, large numbers of people are voting weeks ahead of the election date, and what is most disturbing, is that the media is broadcasting the trends - so many democrats, so many republicans - even if they those votes have not yet been counted, and there could be any crossovers. I haven't seen anything about this on television and I presume the NYT has kept quiet about it, but it certainly doesn't look kosher to me. - Advertisement -",1
What Is At Stake In The Election,"Here Are The Presstitutes Who Control American's Minds . 
I just heard an NPR presstitute declare that Texas, a traditional sure thing for Republicans was up for grabs in the presidential election. Little wonder if this report on Zero Hedge is correct. Apparently, the voting machines are already at work stealing the election for Killary. 
From my long experience in journalism, I know the American public is not very sharp. Nevertheless, it is difficult for me to believe that Americans, whose jobs, careers, and the same for their children and grandchildren, have been sold out by the elites who Hillary represents would actually vote for her. It makes no sense. If this were the case, how did Trump get the Republican nomination despite the vicious presstitute campaign against him? 
It seems obvious that the majority of Americans who have been suffering terribly at the hands of the One Percent who own Hillary lock, stock, and barrel, will not vote for the people who have ruined their lives and the lives of their children and grandchildren. 
Furthermore, if Trump's election is as impossible as the presstitutes tell us--Hillary's win is 93% certain according to the latest presstitute pronouncement--the vicious 24/7 attacks on Trump would be pointless. Wouldn't they? Why the constant, frenetic, vicious attacks on a person who has no chance? - Advertisement - 
There are reports that a company associated with Hillary backer George Soros is supplying the voting machines to 16 states, including states that determine election outcomes. I do not know that these reports are correct. However, I do know for a fact that the oligarchic interests that rule America are opposed to Trump being elected President for the simple reason that they are unsure that they would be able to control him. 
It is hard to believe that dispossessed Americans will vote for Hillary, the representative of those who have dispossessed them, when Trump says he will re-empower the dispossessed. Hillary has denigrated ordinary Americans who, she says, she is so removed from by her wealth that she doesn't even know who they are. Clearly, Hillary, paid $675,000 by Goldman Sachs for three 20-minute speeches, is not a representative of the people. She represents the One Percent whose policies have flushed the prospects of ordinary Americans down the toilet. 
What is really disturbing is the pretense by the presstitute scum that Trump's lewd admiration for female charms is deemed more important than the prospect of nuclear war. At no time during the presidential primaries or during the current presidential campaign has it been mentioned that Russia is being assaulted daily by propaganda, threatened by military buildups, and being convinced that the United States and its European vassals are planning an attack. 
A threatened Russia, made insecure by inexplicable hostility and Western propaganda, is a danger manufactured by the neoconservative supporters of Hillary Clinton. 
If the American people are really so unbelievably stupid that they think lewd remarks about women are more important than avoiding nuclear war, the American people are too stupid to exist. They will deserve the mushroom clouds that will wipe them and everyone else off the face of the earth. - Advertisement - 
Donald Trump is the only candidate in the primaries and the general election who has said that he sees no point in conflict with Russia when Putin has shown nothing but desire to work things out to mutual advantage. 
In contrast, Hillary has declared the thrice-elected president of Russia to be ""the new Hitler"" and has threatened Russia with military action. Hillary talks openly about regime change in Russia. 
Surely, in a free media at least one person in the print and TV media would raise this most important of all points. But where have you seen it?

"Inside The Invisible Government: War, Propaganda, Clinton & Trump","License DMCA The American journalist, Edward Bernays, is often described as the man who invented modern propaganda. The nephew of Sigmund Freud, the pioneer of psycho-analysis, it was Bernays who coined the term ""public relations"" as a euphemism for spin and its deceptions. In 1929, he persuaded feminists to promote cigarettes for women by smoking in the New York Easter Parade -- behavior then considered outlandish. One feminist, Ruth Booth, declared, ""Women! Light another torch of freedom! Fight another sex taboo!"" Bernays' influence extended far beyond advertising. His greatest success was his role in convincing the American public to join the slaughter of the First World War. The secret, he said, was ""engineering the consent"" of people in order to ""control and regiment [them] according to our will without their knowing about it."" 
He described this as ""the true ruling power in our society"" and called it an ""invisible government."" Today, the invisible government has never been more powerful and less understood. In my career as a journalist and film-maker, I have never known propaganda to insinuate our lives and as it does now and to go unchallenged. Imagine two cities. Both are under siege by the forces of the government of that country. Both cities are occupied by fanatics, who commit terrible atrocities, such as beheading people. - Advertisement - 
But there is a vital difference. In one siege, the government soldiers are described as liberators by Western reporters embedded with them, who enthusiastically report their battles and air strikes. There are front page pictures of these heroic soldiers giving a V-sign for victory. There is scant mention of civilian casualties. In the second city -- in another country nearby -- almost exactly the same is happening. Government forces are laying siege to a city controlled by the same breed of fanatics. The difference is that these fanatics are supported, supplied and armed by ""us"" -- by the United States and Britain. They even have a media center that is funded by Britain and America. Another difference is that the government soldiers laying siege to this city are the bad guys, condemned for assaulting and bombing the city -- which is exactly what the good soldiers do in the first city. Confusing? Not really. Such is the basic double standard that is the essence of propaganda. I am referring, of course, to the current siege of the city of Mosul by the government forces of Iraq, who are backed by the United States and Britain and to the siege of Aleppo by the government forces of Syria, backed by Russia. One is good; the other is bad. - Advertisement - What is seldom reported is that both cities would not be occupied by fanatics and ravaged by war if Britain and the United States had not invaded Iraq in 2003. That criminal enterprise was launched on lies strikingly similar to the propaganda that now distorts our understanding of the civil war in Syria. Without this drumbeat of propaganda dressed up as news, the monstrous ISIS and Al-Qaida and al-Nusra and the rest of the jihadist gang might not exist, and the people of Syria might not be fighting for their lives today. Some may remember in 2003 a succession of BBC reporters turning to the camera and telling us that Blair was ""vindicated"" for what turned out to be the crime of the century. The US television networks produced the same validation for George W. Bush. Fox News brought on Henry Kissinger to effuse over Colin Powell's fabrications. The same year, soon after the invasion, I filmed an interview in Washington with Charles Lewis, the renowned American investigative journalist. I asked him, ""What would have happened if the freest media in the world had seriously challenged what turned out to be crude propaganda?""",1

Those presumably more enlightened individuals [bear with me] in turn define and explain their versions of truths, beliefs, and obligations--all in the context of a judging, to-be-feared-and-obeyed, person-like Entity. No small measure of self-interest factors in to their assessments. Keeping ardent followers sufficiently agitated about some loving Deity's wrath [an oxymoron on a grand scale!] allows those professing a direct phone line to the One and Only all the time and opportunity they need to preserve their political and economic advantages without so much as a peep from those loyal supplicants. Hell of a racket.... The current crop of Its spokespeople earn kudos for the ways in which they have fashioned very creative takes on what they claim to be The One and Only Word. Perhaps it's time that we all recognize and simply accept [assuming we accept any kind of theology to begin with] that one religious conviction is in fact no more rational--or irrational--than another. With so many contradictory beliefs, either there is some other unifying and overarching principle, or we will continue to sabotage ourselves and the future of generations to follow by fighting to assert we're right and everyone else is wrong. We own that choice. By its very nature the Source of our Universe is unfathomable. We simply do not have the means or capabilities to define with certainty that great mystery--try as we do. So instead, a great many among us have fashioned a notion that some human-like-but-slightly-better-and-bigger-person-like God/Allah/Whatever created all. Furthermore--apparently--only some know just what It wants from us. That is so convenient, isn't it! - Advertisement - That also frees up some thinking time on the part of those same loyal followers. Why think if someone else is willing to do all of that hard work for us, Right? Aside from that perk, this ceding of rational contemplation is a problem. Always has been. It will continue to be. For all of us, that must change. Acquiescence--or silence--each carry consequences. Were they limited to those followers disinclined to ponder their marching orders, we would certainly have at least one less set of concerns on our plates. If only.... Any honest reading of American history does not suggest a Christian nation that has had secularism forced on it in recent years by liberal forces, but the opposite. Ours is a country that has always been basically secular but has always had to contend with a loud-mouthed minority of theocrats who periodically succeed at using government to push religion until the forces of secularism beat them back again. It's obvious why conservative Christians would like to believe otherwise. Believing they're an oppressed group being denied their birthright is a lot more fun than accepting that they are an oppressive group trying to steal basic freedoms from everyone else. Ignorance, narrow-mindedness, self-serving behaviors, paranoia, fears, and the full range of irrational, fact-challenged nonsense do not manifest themselves inside a protective bubble. The more we collectively permit the subtle infiltration of curiously hypocritical mandates into policy-making, the more certain we can be that outcomes will benefit only very few. Basic math skills tell us that when only a few ""win,"" most lose. That's not a good place for us to be. - Advertisement - Adapted from a blog post of mine View Ratings | Rate It http://richardturcotte.com/

Preventing Crime in New Jersey,"(7 fans) - Advertisement - 
Recently, around midnight, two young men were trying to steal some money from my car. Unknowingly, they tripped the car alarm and I woke up as soon as it went off since my bedroom is very close to the driveway. They stole my registration and insurance card. I immediately called Middle Township Police. The police were very kind and helpful, and I'd like to thank them. This is one example of many of increasing terror/criminal activities in New Jersey, which is an issue we need to address without delay. We have to make sure we are taking appropriate action to deter crimes throughout New Jersey. According to a report on NJ.com, the 2015 FBI data showed there were 363 murders in New Jersey -- up from 349 the previous year. The slight bump increased the rate to 4.1 murders per 100,000 residents. Sexual assault, murder, manslaughter, rape, and robbery are also increasing. Last month, in some counties, disputes between police and criminals resulted in shootings. Crime seems to be rising steadily and violently at an accelerating rate in New Jersey's major counties. The above-mentioned issues might affect tourism, which in turn will affect New Jersey's economy as a whole. New Jersey is a beautiful state but recently, higher taxes, limited job opportunities, crimes and poorly paid workers are adding to poverty, and need to be addressed properly. I think this has and will hinder the growth of New Jersey's economy and the rise of crime now and in the future. The executive director of the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime, Yury Fedotov, told the Convention in Vienna, the 2030 agenda for sustainable development acknowledged that confronting crime and promoting the rule of law were essential to the achievement of the sustainable-development goals. World Health Organization said, ""We need to integrate violence prevention into social and educational policies, and thereby promote social equality."" There is a variety of intervention programs we need to implement that may help people, especially young people, stop committing crimes. If our goal is to reduce crimes then programs related to those should be located in local areas. We also need a systematic approach to support schools to activate their involvement against crime activities to develop these kinds of programs that will demonstrate positive results. We also need to teach crime-resolution skills to our small children. In my opinion, the key to making New Jersey less dangerous is to reduce the time and effort that makes it so expensive to arrest and convict the guilty people, costing more for New Jersey as a whole. I think creating more job opportunities will reduce the crime. It is a basic human right to live crime-free and from being a victim of one. - Advertisement - However, many countries around the globe failed to identify the problems and have no program against it that has left many people with no choice but to become a victim of crime. There is an urgent need for crime protection and human-rights monitoring. - Advertisement -",1
Permit Me To Clarify My Position (An Apology for Prometheus),"Prometheus Brings Fire To Man(image by Friedrich Fuger) License DMCA I have been 'accused' by another contributor at OEN of advocating violent resistance against the US government. So I need to address this issue. In a comment on an anti-war article by David Swanson, I stated clearly that I am not a violent revolutionary because peace has to begin somewhere and the only place I have real control is with myself so I accept the principle that a peace and an anti-war position begins with me. But what does taking a serious peace-position mean? Many years ago, more than once, I protested and 'marched' with Martin Luther King Jr. for peace and justice at home and abroad (Vietnam). I paid for this with threats on my life, a broken wrist, and a fractured occipital bone. A man I knew at the time told me that if I had cut my hair and stayed at home or just gone to a baseball game or some other proper American activity instead of walking the street and asking for trouble, I would never have suffered those threats and injuries. He said that I was the one who caused the violence. And in a way, he was right. When MLK decided to organize protests and marches, he was asking for trouble. And he knew it better than anyone. When he was talking and marching about racial equality and against war he was risking the possibility of injury or death, but when he moved to Chicago to live with the poor and began openly demanding changes in the economic system that risk possibility became a certainty. From that decision on there was a bullet with his name on it. Many people suffered threats, injury, and sometimes death because of MLK. He caused a great deal of violence because he was serious about radically changing the socio-economic system he lived in and knew the change would never come if he simply wrote letters to his congressman and restricted his activity to baseball games and other proper things. When Bobby Kennedy decided to begin dismantling the CIA, he was asking for big trouble. And he got it: Murder. Poor man should have just stuck to baseball games, flag waving, and ineffective idealistic speeches. Or he and King should have just dropped out of public view and retreated into an Eastern monastery, anonymously meditated for the rest of their lives, and let karma take care of everything. Because taking a serious position in the world (outside a monastery) is just asking for trouble, as in VIOLENCE. - Advertisement - When I was a teenager there was a huge popular wave of anti-Christian and pro-Hindu sentiment among mostly white young people in the US. India was endlessly referred to as the true Holy Land in which rose the true Holy Men. All Western 'saints' were just shallow pretenders. I was always troubled and alienated by this partly because I had some knowledge of the history of India and was quite aware of its age-long atrocious poverty and class-discrimination reality. I was amazed at the fact that hip kids in the US would rant about poverty and injustice and class distinction in the US and simply ignore these realities in India because there were these bearded-beaded gurus in lotus-position Samadhi transcendence in India. Very strange reality-disconnect. I never bought it and it took me years of academic study and self-examination to see how deep this doubt on my part really went. I finally realized that I actually saw the transcendental Hindu philosophy of India as itself being ethically lacking in some essential way that I had difficulty articulating to myself. It wasn't a matter of political activity. By this time I had already realized that I was an anarchist and rejected political structures on principle because they were inevitably hierarchical and therefore gave powers and rights to a few people and denied these powers and rights to the rest of the people. My rejection of India and its spiritual philosophy wasn't political. It went deeper than that. Then it suddenly hit me that India's poverty was a blazing symbol of India's denial of the reality and value of the material world. It simply didn't matter that masses of people lived in nightmare poverty. I was a child in the Roman Catholic Church and I took it very seriously. I took Jesus Christ very seriously. I took all of Christian mythology very seriously. I thought and felt and evaluated all things in life in terms of this mythology. Then something began to happen that caused some major cracks in the walls of my cathedral world. I began to get a sense, a tormenting sense, that there was some sort of core contradiction in the whole thing. I started becoming very uneasy about this unimaginably big guy called GOD. It wasn't that I doubted that He was there (somewhere). It was more that I was profoundly troubled about what it was exactly that He was up to. I mean what was all this really about? I was a serious theology student even as a young man and this is the problem I ran into: If God was infinite, eternal, omniscient, omnipotent and perfect in every possible way, then what was the point of me? I was completely unnecessary because everything was already perfect. And me? I was unimaginably far away from perfect. So what was the point of me? I was like an infinitesimal stain on perfection. And I couldn't erase myself. I could only hope that GOD would tolerate me. Forever. And the idea that I was loved by GOD precisely because I was a miserable and hopelessly imperfect little sinner was actually more disgusting and terrifying than it was affirming. I mean what the HELL was going on? Why was I created? I was sure that I knew exactly how Frankenstein's monster felt. And I began to sense what I would later think of as the blind cruelty of the transcendent. Let me explain one more thing before I return to the original question of revolutionary violence. The story of the resurrection and ascension of Jesus Christ in Christian mythology is very peculiar if one looks at it very closely. I am not referring merely to the claim that someone actually rose from the dead. It goes beyond that. Please look at this with me. The mythology claims that Jesus rose from the dead physically and showed himself to his disciples who saw and heard and touched him physically. It was a physical body addressing them. Then this physical body began to do things that physical bodies can't ordinarily do. It moved through physical walls without doing any damage to itself or the wall. Then it finally ascended. That is, it disappeared leaving absolutely nothing physical behind. The ordinary explanation for this in Christian teaching is that the body of Christ was spiritualized. But if that is the correct explanation then why was it ever physical or material to begin with? Why did Jesus bother to rise from the grave physically at all if he was only going to spiritualize in the end? For that matter, what was the point of 'imperfect' material creation at all if its destiny is only to return into pure spirit in the end? It's not only senseless, it is downright perverse. It's a grotesquerie that has no point. The material world has a point in itself or it doesn't and if it doesn't then why is it even here? And if it does then we need to become conscious of what its point is. The frequently expressed opinion that we are really spiritual beings who are just here in the material world to learn is nonsense to which I say, ""Learn what? How to be spiritual? If we are meant to be learning how to be spiritual then we should have stayed spiritual. And if we are learning how to be material then material existence has a meaning in itself that is not just spiritual. And if material existence has meaning in itself then we need to learn how to guard the sanctity of material existence, which means that it is not acceptable that people force other people into poverty or into war or into any form of material deprivation or abuse . We material revolutionaries fight for the sanctity of material existence. To fight for this means to stand up physically and if standing up physically leads to violence then that is the price we pay for doing what is right. And to deny the sanctity of the material world is to render it absurd and therefore to render reality absurd."" - Advertisement - I do not advocate any initiation of violence. But if violence comes to us for standing up for human material dignity then we accept it and we persist until we triumph or until death lays us down.

The Cannon Ball Saga: An Epic Story From The American Heartland,"License DMCA 
There is an epic clash of two cultures -- one with a guiding ethic of harmony between people and nature, the other driven by an ethos that encourages the exploitation of both. Yet, for months, our clueless media gave this match-up little coverage. 
For the face-off is between Energy Transfer Partners, one of the world's largest pipeline corporations, and the Standing Rock Lakota Sioux Tribe. It's not merely big news, but the panoramic story of America itself. It's a real reality show -- a cultural, political and moral drama featuring raw greed, grassroots courage, class war, ancient rites, human rights, defenders of the common good, the most nefarious Texas oilman since J. R. Ewing, a historic gathering of Native tribes and a Bull-Connor-style sheriff -- all on location near a North Dakota town named Cannon Ball! 
The Dakota Access Pipeline is a massive 1,172-mile-long pipeline being constructed by EPT. It will cut through North Dakota, South Dakota, Iowa and Illinois. This pipeline, owned by oilman Kelcy Warren, crosses 200 rivers and countless farms, and it cuts through the ancestral lands and burial grounds of the Tribe. 
DAPL risks economic and environmental disaster. The corporation plans to bury its oil pipeline under the Missouri, beneath the Lakota people's main source of water for drinking, bathing, irrigation, fishing, and recreation. As a Lakota phrase says -- water is life -- and one rupture could be ruinous. 
In April, the Standing Rock Sioux made their stand. Some 35 tribal leaders established Sacred Stone Camp, just off their reservation and near where ETP's engineers intend to tunnel under the river. After the tribe's social media network spread word of the rebellion, a spontaneous migration of Native people -- not coordinated by anyone -- began arriving at the camp to stand in solidarity against ETP. - Advertisement - 
They came in cars, campers, and caravans -- some even paddled down the Missouri in traditional canoes. By August, representatives of 280 Native American tribes had joined, making this the largest, most diverse, cross-tribal action in U.S. history. Sacred Stone Camp pulsated with a sense of rediscovered power, ancestral duty, and indigenous culture. Not only were spirits high, but the extraordinary unity of so many diverse Native cultures -- boldly gathering in a show of strength and shouting ""NO"" to yet another arrogant act of gross injustice -- seemed to herald a reawakening. 
As the protest gained strength -- and was joined by thousands of progressives and covered by independent media -- ETP and its political minions responded predictably: with panic, whining, lies, and brute force. 
North Dakota's governor, Jack Dalrymple falsely wailed that ""unlawful acts associated with the protest near Cannon Ball have led to serious public safety concerns and property damage."" He declared a state of emergency, set up road blocks to seal off the reservation, brought in riot-clad troopers, removed state water and health services from the protest area, and used his state PR machine to demonize the activists as a violent threat to surrounding towns of white people. 
ETP's legal beagles have attempted to silence protesters by filing hokey lawsuits against several tribal leaders and activists that may be aimed at bankrupting defendants with legal fees; seeking a federal injunction against anyone interfering with pipeline construction; and threatening to prosecute Native Americans for -- Oh, the irony! -- trespassing on land that was theirs before it was stolen from them. 
On Labor Day weekend, a DAPL crew suddenly started construction on the under-river tunnel, reportedly damaging tribal burial sites. When unarmed protesters put their bodies in front of the machinery, a line of private ""pipeline guards"" showed up and blasted at least 30 protesters with pepper spray and sicced a pack of attack dogs on them. At least six people were bitten, including a child and a pregnant woman. - Advertisement - 
At least four reporters have been charged with everything from criminal trespass to conspiracy for trying to cover what the mainstream media won't touch. Charges are still pending for some of these journalists. 
Standing Rock tribe's chair, Dave Archambault has made clear that the Native people are committed to the higher values of ""our lands, people, water, and sacred sites."" As they have been for millennia, the tribe's actions today must be based on the common good of their grandchildren and their grandchildren-generations into the future. The Standing Rock Sioux are in this fight for the long haul: ""Our fight isn't over until there is permanent protection of our people and resources from the pipeline. We won't stop until they [EPT] stop."" To find out more and join the fight, go to www.SacredStoneCamp.org .",1
Study Confirms Network Evening Newscasts Have Abandoned Policy Coverage For 2016 Campaign,"License DMCA 
Walking away from a long-standing tradition of covering issues and presidential policies during campaign season, the network evening newscasts have all but abandoned that type of reporting this year, according to recent tabulations from Tyndall Report, which for decades has tracked the flagship nightly news programs. 
Since the beginning of 2016, ABC's World News Tonight , CBS Evening News and NBC Nightly News have devoted just 32 minutes to issues coverage, according to Andrew Tyndall. 
Differentiating issues coverage from daily campaign coverage where policy topics might be addressed, Tyndall defines issues coverage by a newscast this way: ""It takes a public policy, outlines the societal problem that needs to be addressed, describes the candidates' platform positions and proposed solutions, and evaluates their efficacy."" 
And here's how that kind of in-depth coverage breaks down, year to date, by network: 
ABC: 8 minutes, all of which covered terrorism. - Advertisement - 
NBC: 8 minutes for terrorism, LBGT issues, and foreign policy. 
CBS: 16 minutes for foreign policy, terrorism, immigration, policing, and the Environmental Protection Agency. 
And this remarkable finding from Tyndall [emphasis added]: 
""No trade, no healthcare, no climate change, no drugs, no poverty, no guns, no infrastructure, no deficits. To the extent that these issues have been mentioned, it has been on the candidates' terms, not on the networks' initiative."" 
These numbers are staggering in terms of the complete retreat they represent from issues-orientated campaign coverage. Just eight years ago, the last time both parties nominated new candidates for the White House, the network newscasts devoted 220 minutes to issues coverage, compared to only 32 minutes so far this year. ( CBS Evening News went from 119 minutes of issues coverage in 2008 to 16 this year.) - Advertisement - 
Note that during the Republican primary season alone, the networks spent 333 minutes focusing on Donald Trump. Yet for all of 2016, they have set aside just one-tenth of that for issue reporting. 
And look at this: Combined, the three network newscasts have slotted 100 minutes so far this year for reporting on Hillary Clinton's emails while she served as secretary of state, but just 32 minutes for all issues coverage . (NBC's Nightly News has spent 31 minutes on the emails this year; just eight minutes on issues.) 
Indeed, this approach used to be a hallmark of presidential campaign reporting; outline what candidates stand for, describe what their presidency might look like, and compare and contrast that platform with his or her opponents. i.e., What would the new president's top priorities be on the first day of his or her new administration? 
It seems clear that the media's abandonment of issues coverage benefits Trump since his campaign has done very little to outline the candidate's core beliefs. Clinton, by contrast, has done the opposite.",1
Public vs. Media on War,"(128 fans) - Advertisement - 
A new poll from an unlikely source suggests that the U.S. public and the U.S. media have very little in common when it comes to matters of war and peace. 
This poll was commissioned by that notorious leftwing hotbed of peaceniks, the Charles Koch Institute, along with the Center for the National Interest (previously the Nixon Center, and before that the humorously named Nixon Center for Peace and Freedom). The poll was conducted by Survey Sampling International. 
They polled 1,000 registered voters from across the U.S. and across the political spectrum but slanted slightly toward older age groups. They asked: 
""Over the last 15 years, do you think U.S. foreign policy has made Americans more or less safe?"" 
What, dear reader, do you say? 
If you say less safe, you not only agree with dozens of top U.S. officials the week after they retire, but you agree with 52.5% of the people polled. Those who said ""more safe"" add up to 14%, while 25.2% said ""about the same"" and 8.3% just didn't know. 
Well, at least all these humanitarian wars to spread democracy and eliminate weapons and destroy terror have benefited the rest of the world, right? 
Not according to the statistics that show terrorism on the rise during the war on terrorism, and not according to 50.5% of poll respondents who said U.S. foreign policy has made the world less safe. Meanwhile 12.6% said ""more safe"" while 24.1% said it was about the same and 12.8% didn't know. - Advertisement - 
Asked about four wars in particular, registered U.S. voters said each of them had made the U.S. less secure, by a margin of 49.6% to 20.9% on Iraq, 42.2% to 18.9% on Libya, 42.2% to 24.3% on Afghanistan, and 40.8% to 32.1% on bombing ISIS in Syria. 
These answers should not immediately be taken to prove that the U.S. public is universally wise and well informed, and (not coincidentally) at odds with U.S. media. Not only is that margin pretty slim on ISIS, but 43.3% of those polled said ISIS was the greatest threat the United States faces. Meanwhile 14.1% named Russia, 8.5% North Korea, 8.1% the national debt, 7.9% domestic terrorists, and bringing up the rear with the correct answer of global warming as the greatest threat were a grand total of 4.6% of those polled. 
A survey of U.S. news reports would certainly suggest a point of agreement here between the public and the media. But here is where it gets interesting. Although the public believes the hype about danger emanating from these foreign forces, it does not favor the solution it is endlessly offered by the media and the U.S. government. When asked if, compared to last 15 years, the next president should use the U.S. military abroad less, 51.1% agreed, while 24.2% said it should be used more. And 80.0% said that any president should be required to get congressional authorization before committing the U.S. to military action, while 10.2% rejected that radical idea that's been in the U.S. Constitution since day 1. 
The U.S. public may look quite depressingly ignorant in a quick survey of Youtube videos, but check this out: Asked if the U.S. government should deploy U.S. troops on the ground in Syria 51.1% said no, compared to 23.5% who said yes. Only 10% said yes on Yemen, while 22.8% said no -- however, 40.7% said the U.S. government should keep ""supporting"" Saudi Arabia in that war. 
Good majorities also oppose Japan acquiring nuclear weapons, Germany acquiring nuclear weapons, or the U.S. defending Taiwan against a Chinese attack. (Who invents these scenarios?) - Advertisement - 
This moderately encouraging survey of public sentiment stands in stark contrast to U.S. media coverage of wars in general and Syria in particular . The New York Times' Nicholas Kristof is ready for a bigger war as are columnists in the Washington Post and USA Today , as well as, of course Chuck Todd and other televised talking head. Meanwhile Hillary Clinton's comment to Goldman Sachs that a ""no fly zone"" would require ""killing a lot of Syrians"" has received dramatically less press than her brave calls for creating a humanitarian no fly zone, and the steady depiction of that proposal as ""doing something"" -- in contrast to the only other option: ""doing nothing."" 
The public, however, rejects the only ""something"" that's on offer and just might leap at the opportunity to try something else, if anyone ever proposed anything else .

"The Cosmic Story: Scorpio New Moon, October 30, 2016","The Cosmic Story: Scorpio New Moon, October 30, 2016 Entering the Cauldron of Regeneration The Sun entered the sign of Scorpio on Saturday, October 22, 2016. Leaving behind the airy social realm of Libra, we now plunge into the dark watery realms of the Unconscious. As we worked to balance our inner and outer lives in Libra, now we come to the point where we have to let go of what no longer serves us. This requires that we turn within and look at those emotions which keep us imprisoned in our pasts. As we face our inner darkness, the world outside is also growing dark. The Sun moves lower into the southern hemisphere, bringing them the warmth of Spring and coming Summer, while leaving us in the North with fading light, shorter days and colder weather. Nature is letting go of its life as the year dies. Samhain Ritual 2012 License DMCA Samhain Ritual/Sekhmet Just after this intense New Moon we'll be celebrating Samhain, the last Gate of the Wheel of the Year. At Samhain, the old year dies so the new year can be born. The veils between the world are very thin, and the spirits of the dead are very close to us. We celebrate Samhain, Halloween, All Hallow's Eve, the Day of the Dead, All Saints Day and All Souls Day to honor our ancestors at this transitional time. - Advertisement - The great goddess who embodies the energies of Samhain is Hecate, most ancient Goddess of the Triple Crossroads, Queen of the Witches and Guide and Protector on the road to the Underworld. She stands at the Crossroads with her two torches and her black dog at her side. She can see the past, the present and the future and while we each have to choose our path, she lends us one of her torches and sends her faithful companion to guide our steps into the mystery of our future selves. For more about Hecate: http://ladywisdomchronicles.blogspot.com/ Scorpio New Moon Scorpio is often considered the most powerful sign in the Zodiac, and those who incarnate as Scorpios, some of the most powerful souls. For Scorpio's initiation is pivotal to our soul's growth, which is to die to be reborn again. For anyone living under patriarchy, where we have been disconnected from our feminine, soulful consciousness, death is the ultimate test to our unconscious Ego. We have been taught to fear death as a punishment or an end, rather than as a transition, a change that will give us back eternal life. And so FEAR is the Gatekeeper we have to face as we sink into the dark, murky emotions from past lives which keep us stuck in old patterns of disconnection, betrayal, horror and hurt. It's interesting that the American elections are always held during the Sun's transit through Scorpio, signaling a transition of power, a transformation of our collective lives. Indeed, that's also what Scorpio is about. Power. The ruling planets of Scorpio are Mars and Pluto. Pluto, or Hades, is the Lord of the Underworld, ruling the unconscious depths within us. These depths can lie quiet when we live by ourselves, but they get stirred up when we relate to others. And that's why Scorpio also rules intimacy, the emotional sharing that's necessary for a deep, rich life. And Mars the Warrior is what is needed to give us the courage to face those emotions. Scorpio is concentrated emotional power which propels the energy of evolution, and so it is the repository of unconscious instinctual drives, old emotional patterns and attachments and the compulsive tendencies that we bring with us personally and collectively from other lifetimes as well as from our early childhood. These old emotional wounds keep us stuck in fear and suspicion. Jung called them the Shadow. They are the parts of us that we can't see about ourselves and which we tend to project onto others instead of taking responsibility for ourselves. The Shadow is alive and well in our culture at the moment. Perhaps the very obvious examples we see in the news will help us deal with our personal Shadows. - Advertisement - When we operate out of these unconscious patterns, we tend to use emotional manipulation, defensiveness and vindictiveness to get our way. This is the lowest form of Scorpionic energy, the unconscious energy of survival at all costs. The Snake often symbolizes this aspect of Scorpio, although its transformation is possible with the shedding of its skin--or our unconscious Ego drives. In many ways, snake is best seen as our instinctual wisdom so perhaps the better symbol is the Scorpion, which will sting itself in its frenzy to sting the other. We've seen this kind of lower Scorpio energy in some of Donald Trump's attacks on women and minorities instead of admitting his own mistakes. Eagle License DMCA Scorpio has three symbols because it concerns the process of transformation, and three is the number of process. The unconscious residue from other lifetimes which eats away at us is symbolized by the scorpion. Once we begin to recognize our Shadow and can name it, the symbol shifts to an Eagle. And Eagle is the highest flying bird, able to see far and wide. Like Great Spirit, it gives us an overview of our lives. Eagle Scorpios can look at and name their Shadows, but they can also repress those shadowy instincts and certainly not talk about them! They use their will power to keep those negative instincts in line. But that's just a step to the third part of the process: the death of old habits and complexes. The re-integration of those repressed emotions and instincts then give rise to a new birth, which is symbolized by the phoenix, who burns up old karma and arises out of the ashes with a new, spiritual vision. This is the initiation of Scorpio. To go through all the tests that life brings us and learn from our mistakes and find the meaning of what it is we are sent here to learn.",1
"The Modern History of ""Rigged"" US Elections","License DMCA 
The United States is so committed to the notion that its electoral process is the world's ""gold standard"" that there has been a bipartisan determination to maintain the fiction even when evidence is overwhelming that a U.S. presidential election has been manipulated or stolen. The ""wise men"" of the system simply insist otherwise. 
We have seen this behavior when there are serious questions of vote tampering (as in Election 1960) or when a challenger apparently exploits a foreign crisis to create an advantage over the incumbent (as in Elections 1968 and 1980) or when the citizens' judgment is overturned by judges (as in Election 2000). 
Strangely, in such cases, it is not only the party that benefited which refuses to accept the evidence of wrongdoing, but the losing party and the establishment news media as well. Protecting the perceived integrity of the U.S. democratic process is paramount. Americans must continue to believe in the integrity of the system even when that integrity has been violated. 
The harsh truth is that pursuit of power often trumps the principle of an informed electorate choosing the nation's leaders, but that truth simply cannot be recognized. 
Of course, historically, American democracy was far from perfect, excluding millions of people, including African-American slaves and women. The compromises needed to enact the Constitution in 1787 also led to distasteful distortions, such as counting slaves as three-fifths of a person for the purpose of representation (although obviously slaves couldn't vote). - Advertisement - 
That unsavory deal enabled Thomas Jefferson to defeat John Adams in the pivotal national election of 1800. In effect, the votes of Southern slave owners like Jefferson counted substantially more than the votes of Northern non-slave owners. 
Even after the Civil War when the Constitution was amended to give black men voting rights, the reality for black voting, especially in the South, was quite different from the new constitutional mandate. Whites in former Confederate states concocted subterfuges to keep blacks away from the polls to ensure continued white supremacy for almost a century. 
Women did not gain suffrage until 1920 with the passage of another constitutional amendment, and it took federal legislation in 1965 to clear away legal obstacles that Southern states had created to deny the franchise to blacks. 
Indeed, the alleged voter fraud in Election 1960, concentrated largely in Texas, a former Confederate state and home to John Kennedy's vice presidential running mate, Lyndon Johnson, could be viewed as an outgrowth of the South's heritage of rigging elections in favor of Democrats, the post-Civil War party of white Southerners. 
However, by pushing through civil rights for blacks in the 1960s, Kennedy and Johnson earned the enmity of many white Southerners who switched their allegiance to the Republican Party via Richard Nixon's Southern strategy of coded racial messaging. Nixon also harbored resentments over what he viewed as his unjust defeat in the election of 1960. - Advertisement - 
Nixon's ""Treason"" 
So, by 1968, the Democrats' once solid South was splintering, but Nixon, who was again the Republican presidential nominee, didn't want to leave his chances of winning what looked to be another close election to chance. Nixon feared that -- with the Vietnam War raging and the Democratic Party deeply divided -- President Johnson could give the Democratic nominee, Vice President Hubert Humphrey, a decisive boost by reaching a last-minute peace deal with North Vietnam.

The documentary and testimonial evidence is now clear that to avert a peace deal, Nixon's campaign went behind Johnson's back to persuade South Vietnamese President Nguyen van Thieu to torpedo Johnson's Paris peace talks by refusing to attend. Nixon's emissaries assured Thieu that a President Nixon would continue the war and guarantee a better outcome for South Vietnam.",1

[NOTE: By necessity this is a very long PDF document - nearly 500 pages - and I have tried to squeeze as much data as is useful per page while keeping the data on a single page format. You can enlarge the text by enlarging the Acrobat reader window.] 
I have made this spreadsheet so that you can filter and sort the data. For example you can use the sender information (as received) using the ""From"" Column (L). In addition I have separated out the email address and the sender name into two columns at the end of the spreadsheet. What you will find is that some email addresses are associated with multiple user names. Sorting according to these columns will provide a means to determine all emails from a particular email address which will not be visible if you only use the alphabetical sort order of the file names. (This data is only in the spreadsheet. I kept it out of the PDF for presentation). I also include a number which corresponds to how many instances of each (the email address, the user name, and the third (last column) is the number of instances of the original ""From"" column (which combines both email address and user name). This extra data is essential to determining how many emails were sent from particular individuals rather than just one email address and vice versa. 
The first column (C) is the actual file name - an eight digit number - of the original .eml file. This is followed by the second column (E) which contains the Email ID - this is a number assigned by Wikileaks and can be used in their search engine and is essential to identify the URL to the Wikileaks page for that email. The ""Get"" column will allow you to download the original .eml file from the Wikileaks database. The ""Link"" column will open the Wikileaks page to that email on their website. 
The information is presented with a series of colored bands. This is useful for getting a visual image of the whole. Each different colored band represents a different set of emails by data dump (the number of the dump provided in the column of that name ). The DARK ORANGE bands stand out the most - as they represent emails that have yet to be released . This provides a quick visual guide to what is remaining and gaps within a particular sender's set of emails (the emails are listed from the first 1.eml to the last in numerical order - which generates a sort based on the first letter recognized from the ""From"" column - and this is thus listed alphabetically. This can be confusing, however, as while most names are listed with the first letter of the first name some use the first of the last name (i.e. Paul Begala can be found in the ""B"" set toward the beginning of the list when sorted by file name (number)).",1
Pot Decriminalization Saves Philadelphia Millions,"Headlined to H3 10/27/16 - Advertisement - A vivid example of benefits from decriminalization of possessing small amounts of marijuana occurred at the Philadelphia airport recently, a few days after the release of a report from two prominent organizations that called for the national decriminalization of personal use/possession of marijuana and other illicit drugs. This example, interestingly, occurred on the day of the second anniversary of Philadelphia's implementation of decriminalization, the enforcement practice that replaces possession arrests with issuance of traffic-ticket like citations. That enforcement change has saved the City of Philadelphia at least $9-million in costs related to arrests and adjudications for marijuana possession, analysts calculate. However, a few days after that decriminalization anniversary in Philadelphia, a news media report detailed the ordeal experienced by a Philadelphia resident arrested in a suburban county adjacent to Philadelphia for a small amount of marijuana. That chance arrest ultimately led to weeks of needless incarceration in New Jersey, the state where Republican Chris Christie, an avowed opponent of decriminalization, serves as governor. Philly pot arrests drop after decriminalization.(image by LBW Photo) License DMCA The Philadelphia airport discovery of a small amount of marijuana in the luggage of three-time Philadelphia GOP mayoral candidate Sam Katz resulted in embarrassment for Katz but not his arrest and subsequent court proceedings. At the airport, Philadelphia police issued a $25 citation to Katz. Receipt of that citation allowed Katz, a nationally respected municipal finance expert turned award winning documentary filmmaker, to continue to Florida for a planned fishing trip instead of a trip to jail. The 2015 discovery of a similar small amount of marijuana at the then suburban Philadelphia home of Ivan Haynes produced a chain of events dramatically different from what happened to Katz. - Advertisement - Police in the suburban Philadelphia community of Bensalem, Bucks County found a few grams of marijuana when serving a warrant on Haynes for a minor offense. Haynes missed court dates for that marijuana possession arrest because Bucks County authorities sent court date notices to the wrong address. Bucks County authorities issued a bench warrant for the arrest of Haynes when he did not appear in court despite his lack of awareness of those court proceedings. In July 2016, when Haynes was in an automobile that had a minor accident on the New Jersey turnpike, State Police detained him on that bench warrant. That detention led to Haynes' imprisonment in NJ for 41-days before his extradition to Bucks County. Upon return to Pennsylvania Haynes was quickly released by Bucks County authorities and subsequently sentenced to time served (in NJ) for that 2015 marijuana possession arrest. That NJ incarceration robbed the self-employed Haynes of jobs and cost him good-will of some clients. In 2015, Bucks County registered the third highest number of marijuana possession arrests in Pennsylvania at 1,010. Bucks County, Pa -- like the entire state of New Jersey -- has not decriminalized possession of small amounts of marijuana. Over half of the nearly 25,000 marijuana possession arrests in New Jersey during 2014 were for amounts of 50-grams or less. Marijuana prohibition has cost NJ taxpayers between $150-200-million since 2010 when Christie took office, experts estimate. - Advertisement - Before Philadelphia became the largest city in America to implement decriminalization of simple possession of marijuana on October 20, 2014 thousands endured arrest annually. Those arrests produced the stain of a criminal record and often incarceration. During the years 2012-2013 before decriminalization in Philadelpia police arrested 8,580 adults and juveniles. Philadelphia possession arrest figures for 2015 and part of 2016 after implementation of decriminalization, around 1,500 Philadelphians experienced arrest for marijuana possession -- a marked decrease. ""Decriminalization has been a resounding success for the municipal government and for cannabis consumers in Philadelphia,"" PhillyNORML official Chris Goldstein said. Goldstein, an expert on cannabis policy, writes a weekly column on cannabis issue for philly.com, the news website for Philadelphia's two daily newspapers. Days before the decriminalization of marijuana possession anniversary in Philadelphia a report issued jointly by Human Rights Watch and the American Civil Liberties Union called on federal and state authorities to decriminalize personal use and possession of drugs due to the documented failures of the War on Drugs. The two organizations recommended a shift from shift enforcement to prevention and harm reductions.",1
A Christmas Story / There Is No Better Purpose Than To Serve Others.,"License DMCA 
A Story from Far Away 
The holiday season is upon us, and I have a beautiful story to share with you. I told this story to a customer of mine, and, when I'd finished, she told me this in response: 
""I was a manager of a business,"" the customer related, ""and every Christmas I would leave a gift on each of the employees' desks around four o'clock in the morning. I never told them the gift was from me, but I noticed how each recipient would react to it with a sense of ""wonder,"" which seemed to last through the following year. When I quit my job, I told the owner that I was the one who had left those gifts for everyone. I told him I had been doing that for the past ten years, and asked him to promise me that, as the owner of the business, he would continue the tradition after I left."" 
What could I say to this customer, except that she had obviously understood the story I had told her and that she had in effect recapitulated it in spirit in her own life. It still feels good to me to tell that story, and the fact that it spurred my customer to mention its connection to her own good deeds at Christmas makes me want to tell it to you now"". - Advertisement - 
"" A LONG TIME AGO before there were microscopes, it was not uncommon for a man to lose his whole family to a virus. Medical people only had suspicions about what could be causing those illnesses, and they used terms like ""unfilterable substances"" to describe what we now identify as viruses. 
""A man who lived in Turkey many years ago experienced such illness at first hand, losing his entire family to it in one fell swoop. He walked the streets every day, thinking about nothing except how much he missed his family. In his heartbreak, he heard people around him arguing about money in front of their children. How were they going to pay the rent, or buy food? Feeling, in spite of his own sorrow, great compassion for the troubles of others, this Turkish man listened through each window, or cracked door, or hollow wall in the houses of his neighbors to try to determine whom they owed money to or which groceries they were lacking. 
""With the information he garnered, this great man did what he could to help his neighbors. He never told anyone that he was the one who delivered the needed groceries, but simply left them at the door and sneaked away. For him, bereft of his family, it must have been a relief to feel needed and make his existence meaningful again. Later, he would walk by the same homes in the area and see how much happier his neighbors were. He also sensed the relief the children themselves must have felt. Yet, even when he paid his neighbors' bills, he did so in a manner that would not leave a trail leading to him. I tell you this, because the kind Turkish man kept up his charitable works for over ten years, and yet not a soul ever discovered who it was that mysteriously left the loving gifts. 
""Life is filled with wonder, and one day it comes to an end. After the good Turk died, the whole town kept asking, ""Where are the gifts?"" ""Who was doing this?"" Finally, putting two and two together, they figured it out. I am proud to say that, in this case, humanity took care of one of its own. They dug up the old man's bones and built a small walkway to the museum where he now rests. By this Samaritan's example, they taught the children how a great man should act and encouraged them to do him the honor of visiting him in the museum. I can only imagine the anxiety felt by the townspeople in trying to live up to the greatness with which they had been confronted! 
""Since the great man did his deeds, every succeeding generation has willingly retold his story with ever a bit more embellishment. But the imagination they display in doing so can never surpass or even compare to what one man did in helping others while not ever seeking either recognition or praise."" - Advertisement -",1
First Amendment Rights Must Be Protected for Those Peacefully Opposing the Dakota Access Pipeline,"License DMCA 
I stand with the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe in their opposition to the Dakota Access Pipeline . We have witnessed inspiring and brave acts by Native Americans and their allies who are defending and trying to protect their sacred sites and the safety of their sole source of water. 
The fossil fuel industry -- and the owners of the Dakota Access Pipeline in particular -- have been proceeding with what appears to be a dangerous project in blatant disregard of obvious risks to the Missouri River and with disrespect to the Standing Rock Sioux. 
In the process, those trying to force completion of this pipeline have -- according to independent news reports -- been using oppressive practices against this community. In response, Standing Rock Chairman David Archambault has requested that the Justice Department deploy observers to ensure that the First Amendment rights of those peacefully opposing this pipeline are protected. I hope his request is honored. 
The non-violent resistance to the Dakota Access Pipeline is also one of the front-line struggles that collectively mark a turning point in the decision by humanity to turn away from the destructive path we have been following and aim instead toward a clean energy future for all.",1
Russia Calls the War Party's Bluff,"License DMCA 
Cold War 2.0 has reached unprecedented hysterical levels. And yet a hot war is not about to break out -- before or after the November 8 US presidential election. From the Clinton (cash) machine -- supported by a neocon/neoliberalcon think tank/media complex -- to the British establishment and its corporate media mouthpieces, the Anglo-American, self-appointed ""leaders of the free world"" are racking up demonization of Russia and ""Putinism"" to pure incandescence. And yet a hot war is not about to break out -- before or after the November 8 US presidential election. So many layers of fear and loathing in fact veil no more than a bluff. Let's start with the Russian naval task force in Syria, led by the officially designated ""heavy aircraft-carrying cruiser"" Admiral Kuznetsov, which will be stationed in the eastern Mediterranean at least until February 2017, supporting operations against all strands of Salafi-jihadism. 
The Admiral Kuznetsov is fully equipped with anti-ship, air defense, artillery and anti-submarine warfare systems -- and can defend itself against a vast array of threats, unlike NATO vessels. - Advertisement - 
Predictably, NATO is spinning with alarm that ""all of the Northern Fleet,"" along with the Baltic Fleet, is on the way to the Mediterranean. Wrong; it's only part of the Northern Fleet, and the Baltic Fleet ships are not going anywhere. The heart of the matter is that when the capabilities of this Russian naval task force are matched with the S-300/S-400 missile systems already deployed in Syria, Russia is now de facto rivaling the firepower of the US Sixth Fleet. 
To top it off, as this comprehensive military analysis makes clear, Russia has ""basically made their own no-fly zone over Syria""; and a US no-fly zone, viscerally promoted by Hillary Clinton, ""is now impossible to achieve."" That should be more than enough to put into perspective the impotence transmuted into outright anger exhibited by the Pentagon and its neocon/neoliberalcon vassals. 
Add to it the outright war between the Pentagon and the CIA in the Syrian war theater, where the Pentagon backs the YPG Kurds, who are not necessarily in favor of regime change in Damascus, while the CIA backs further weaponizing of ""moderate,"" as in al-Qaeda-linked and/or infiltrated, ""rebels."" Compounding the trademark Obama administration Three Stooges school of foreign policy, American threats have flown more liberally than Negan's skull-crushing bloody baton in the new season of The Walking Dead. 
Pentagon head Ash Carter, a certified neocon, has threatened ""consequences,"" as in ""potential"" strikes against Syrian Arab Army (SAA) forces to ""punish the regime"" after the Pentagon itself broke the Kerry-Lavrov ceasefire. - Advertisement - 
President Obama took some time off weighing his options. And in the end, he backed off. So it will be up for the virtually elected -- by the whole US establishment -- Hillary Clinton to make the fateful decision. She won't be able to go for a no-fly zone -- because Russia is already doing it. And if she decides to ""punish the regime,"" Moscow already telegraphed, via Russia's Defense Ministry spokesman Major-General Igor Konashenkov, there will definitely be ""consequences"" for imposing a ""shadow"" hot war. 
Sun Tzu doesn't do first-strike Washington, of course, reserves for itself a ""first-strike"" nuclear capability,   fully supports (Donald Trump does not, and for that he's also demonized). 
If we allow the current hysteria to literally go nuclear, then we must consider the matter of the S-500 anti-missile system -- which effectively seals Russia's air space; Moscow won't admit it on the record because that would unleash a relentless arms race. A US intel source with close connections to the Masters of the Universe but at the same time opposed to Cold War 2.0 as ""counter-productive,"" adds the necessary nuance: ""The United States has lost the arms race, indulging in trillions of dollars of worthless and endless wars in Afghanistan, Iraq, Syria, Libya, and now is no longer a global power as it cannot defend itself with its obsolete missiles, THAAD, Patriot and Aegis Land Based Ballistic Defense System, against Russian ICBMs, even as the Russians have sealed their airspace. The Russians may be as much as four generations ahead of the US."" 
Moreover, in the deep recesses of shadow war planning, the Pentagon knows, and the Russian Defense Ministry also knows, that in the event some Dr. Strangelove launched a nuclear preemptive strike against Russia, the Russian population would be protected by their defensive missile systems -- as well as nuclear bomb shelters in major cities. Warnings on Russian television have not been idle; the population would know where to go in the -- terrifying -- event of nuclear war breaking out.",1
Michael Moore Owes Me $4.99,"(128 fans) - Advertisement - 
Michael Moore has made some terrific movies in the past, and Where to Invade Next may be the best of them, but I expected Trumpland to be (1) about Trump, (2) funny, (3) honest, (4) at least relatively free of jokes glorifying mass murder. I was wrong on all counts and would like my $4.99 back, Michael. 
Moore's new movie is a film of him doing a stand-up comedy show about how wonderfully awesome Hillary Clinton is -- except that he mentions Trump a bit at the beginning and he's dead serious about Clinton being wonderfully awesome. 
This film is a text book illustration of why rational arguments for lesser evilist voting do not work. Lesser evilists become self-delusionists. They identify with their lesser evil candidate and delude themselves into adoring the person. Moore is not pushing the ""Elect her and then hold her accountable"" stuff. He says we have a responsibility to ""support her"" and ""get behind her,"" and that if after two years -- yes, TWO YEARS -- she hasn't lived up to a platform he's fantasized for her, well then, never fear, because he, Michael Moore, will run a joke presidential campaign against her for the next two years (this from a guy who backed restricting the length of election campaigns in one of his better works). 
Moore maintains that virtually all criticism of Hillary Clinton is nonsense. What do we think, he asks, that she asks how many millions of dollars you've put into the Clinton Foundation and then she agrees to bomb Yemen for you? Bwahahaha! Pretty funny. Except that Saudi Arabia put over $10 million into the Clinton Foundation, and while she was Secretary of State Boeing put in another $900,000, upon   reportedly made it her mission to get the planes sold to Saudi Arabia, despite legal restrictions -- the planes now dropping U.S.-made bombs on Yemen with U.S. guidance, U.S. refueling mid-air, U.S. protection at the United Nations, and U.S. cover in the form of pop-culture distraction and deception from entertainers like Michael Moore. 
Standing before a giant Air Force missile and enormous photos of Hillary Clinton, Michael Moore claims that substantive criticism of Clinton can consist of only two things, which he dismisses in a flash: her vote for a war on Iraq and her coziness with Wall Street. He says nothing more about what that ""coziness"" consists of, and he claims that she's more or less apologized and learned her lesson on Iraq. 
What? It wasn't one vote. It was numerous votes to start the war, fund it, and escalate it. It was the lies to get it going and keep it going. It's all the other wars before and since. She says President Obama was wrong not to launch missile strikes on Syria in 2013. She pushed hard for the overthrow of Qadaffi in 2011. She supported the coup government in Honduras in 2009. She has backed escalation and prolongation of war in Afghanistan. She skillfully promoted the White House justification for the war on Iraq. She does not hesitate to back the use of drones for targeted killing. She has consistently backed the military initiatives of Israel. She was not ashamed to laugh at the killing of Qadaffi. She has not hesitated to warn that she could obliterate Iran. She is eager to antagonize Russia. She helped facilitate a military coup in Ukraine. She has the financial support of the arms makers and many of their foreign customers. She waived restrictions at the State Department on selling weapons to Saudi Arabia, Algeria, Kuwait, United Arab Emirates, Oman, and Qatar, all states wise enough to donate to the Clinton Foundation. She supported President Bill Clinton's wars and the power of the president to make war without Congress. She has advocated for arming fighters in Syria and for a ""No Fly"" zone. She supported a surge in Iraq even before President Bush did. 
That's just her war problem. What about her banking problem, prison problem, fracking problem, corporate trade problem, corporate healthcare problem, climate change problem, labor problem, Social Security problem, etc.? 
Moore parts company from substantive critique in order to lament unproven rightwing claims that Hillary Clinton has murdered various people. ""I hope she did,"" screams Moore. ""That's who I want as Commander in Chief!"" Hee hee hee. - Advertisement - 
Then Moore shamelessly pushes the myth that Hillary tried to create single-payer, or at least ""universal"" healthcare (whatever that is) in the 1990s. In fact, as I heard Paul Wellstone tell it, single-payer easily won the support of Clinton's focus group, but she buried it for her corporate pals and produced the phonebook-size monstrosity that was dead on arrival but reborn in another form years later as Obamacare. She killed single-payer then, has not supported it since, and does not propose it now. (Well, she does admit in private that it's the only thing that works, as her husband essentially blurts out in public.) But Moore claims that because we didn't create ""universal"" healthcare in the 1990s we all have the blood of millions on our hands, millions whom Hillary would have saved had we let her. 
Moore openly fantasizes: what would it be like if Hillary Clinton is secretly progressive? Remember that Moore and many others did the exact same thing with Obama eight years ago. To prove Clinton's progressiveness Moore plays an audio clip of her giving a speech at age 22 in which she does not hint at any position on any issue whatsoever. 
Mostly, however, Moore informs us that Hillary Clinton is female. He anticipates ""that glorious moment when the other gender has a chance to run this world and kick some righteous ass."" Now tell me please, dear world, if your ass is kicked by killers working for a female president will you feel better about it? How do you like Moore's inclusive comments throughout his performance: ""We're all Americans, right?"" 
Moore's fantasy is that Clinton will dash off a giant pile of executive orders, just writing Congress out of the government -- executive orders doing things like releasing all nonviolent drug offenders from prison immediately (something the real Hillary Clinton would oppose in every way she could). 
But when he runs for president, Moore says, he'll give everybody free drugs. - Advertisement - 
I'll tell you the Clinton ad I'd like to see. She's standing over a stove holding an egg. ""This is your brain,"" she says solemnly, cracking it into the pan with a sizzle. ""This is your brain on partisanship."" hillary and bush",1
Can any U.S. President Ever Overcome the Power of the Establishment and Bring Substantive Change to America?,"OpEdNews Op Eds 10/28/2016 at 10:15:27 Can any U.S. President Ever Overcome the Power of the Establishment and Bring Substantive Change to America? License DMCA We're finally approaching the end of this long, drawn-out, and very boring process of electing this country's next president. Millions upon millions of Americans are backing either Hillary Clinton or Donald Trump in the hope that she or he will bring long-awaited, substantive change to this government and this country. They have been waiting, fervently hoping to finally see some individual who possesses great courage, strong leadership skills, and a deep sense of ethics and morals, become president; and to use the power of the presidency to take this country in an entirely new direction, with a government that adheres to the will of the people. Unfortunately, it doesn't look like either of the two current candidates possesses those qualities and characteristics in abundance sometime in the future we may see such an individual emerge. What kind of real substantive change am I talking about? Well in the latter half of the 20 th Century we saw major accomplishments made during the tenures of various presidents, such as sending a man to the moon, together with important advancements in medicine, science and technology, as well as the creation and development of the internet. Those were very significant achievements but not the kind of substantive changes that greatly impacted the direction of this country. The kind of change of which I speak would be more like the enactment of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 or the creation of the Medicare and Medicaid health care systems in 1965; and in years past, the Social Security system. Here's the type of change this country and society needs as we navigate the 21 st century. First and foremost we need to see very ambitious government/business efforts and programs to create millions jobs for Americans. That would help greatly to reinvigorate the middle class and jumpstart our sluggish economy; it would also result in significant reductions in the number of Americans who are dependent on food stamps and other forms of government welfare. - Advertisement - Such a program should include the repair and modernization of our deteriorating national infrastructure, the development of solar and wind power, and the creation of a universal health care system that would finally cover all Americans at much lower costs. We need substantive changes in the way we deal with rampant violence in this country; this problem has been escalating and its way past time that something were done to curtail the proliferation and illegal use of guns that are slaughtering far too many of our innocent fellow Americans. But so far the government and, in particular, this Congress, has refused to address this situation because of the power wielded by the gun industry and the NRA. That continued governmental vacillation combined with NRA obstructive tactics must not be allowed to continue. A large majority of Americans would like to see real, substantive changes such as those identified above put into effect; and all of them are clearly doable. However, that's just not happening because there is a massive, seemingly immovable object standing in the way. That object of obstruction is, of course, the Establishment, which is diametrically opposed to any such progress because its own objectives clash with those of the people. It is very difficult and virtually impossible for any president to overcome the power of this Establishment because of what I refer to as the Circle of Power and Control that exists in Washington; here's how this ultra-powerful, self-perpetuating circle operates; - Advertisement - At the seat of this power is Corporate America which uses monumental amounts of $$$ to influence and control our elections so that a large majority of elected senators and representatives return to the Congress time and again; not to advance the needs of the people but, rather, the interests and objectives of Corporate America. We might refer to these politicians as indentured servants. The Corporatists want to slash corporate taxes to further increase profits, to significantly water down the regulations and restrictions on the banking industry., They support the lobbyists and special interest groups that have infiltrated this Congress and are, not only greatly influencing the enactment of legislation, but are often actually writing it. Congress has, as a very top priority, the ongoing funding of the massive Military-Industrial Complex, i.e., the Pentagon, the CIA, the State and ""Defense"" Departments, and the defense industry corporations which produce the machinery of war. Too many taxpayer dollars that should be used to strengthen this country's deteriorating foundations are, instead, directed to the military establishment to maintain its huge empire of bases and installations all over the world, to conduct invasions and occupations of other nations, and to remove elected leaders and/or dictators in various countries.",1
Who's Racist?,"Street scene near Temple University, 2016(image by Linh Dinh) License DMCA Over three days last week, at least 150 blacks attacked whites at random around Temple University. Victims were surrounded, punched and kicked. Wallets and phones were stolen. Rocks were thrown at passing cars. When cops showed up, one was knocked from her bike and a police horse was even punched twice in the muzzle. Most of the assaults took place on Friday. On Saturday, Joe Lauletta, a father of one victim, reported on FaceBook : I spent last night in the ER at St. Mary's HospitaI. I received a call from my daughter Christina after my sons football game. She was crying, I couldn't understand her, my heart dropped, I became scared, I said what is the matter? Dad, I was jumped, I'm beat up pretty bad. Where r u? Temple, they stole my phone. We're heading to the police station. I do not hear from her until she gets to her apartment. Rage is running through my mind the whole time. She said she is getting a ride home and wants to go to St. Mary's. I find out that her and her 2 male friends where badly beaten by a group of 30-40 black teenagers on their way home from the Temple football game. This happened after they got off the subway at Broad and Cecil B Moore. These sick animals held her down and kicked and stomped on her repeatedly. Thank god, the people from the pizza place intervened. They arrested 2 people at the scene. I have not let Christina out of my sight, she is resting. Every part of her body is badly bruised, it makes me cry just thinking about it. No broken bones. If you have children at Temple, tell them to be careful. Please keep Christina Lauletta in your thoughts. CBS Philadelphia describes another victim's ordeal: He says around 9:30 Friday night he was leaving work when he saw what looked to be at least 200 juveniles walking in large groups. He said he overheard police saying the kids were playing the knockout game. He says a juvenile around 10 years old started shouting obscenities at him and grabbed his phone out of his hand. The student says the juvenile then came back and threw the phone at him, striking him in the face. - Advertisement - Around 15 minutes later, the student says he was walking with his girlfriend when they were approached by at least seven juveniles. The student says he went to hit the Temple Police alert button when his girlfriend was struck by one of the juveniles. As the student was chasing them away, he says he was struck in the face by a someone he estimates to be eight years old. This is not new. In 2014, five black girls, aged 17, 15, 15, 15 and 14, committed three separate attacks on random white people at Temple University. Struck across the face with a brick, a 19-year-old white student suffered a fractured jaw and nearly had her teeth knocked out. Her 15-year-old assailant, Zaria Estes , was given a 2 -6 year sentence. Across America, gangs of blacks have beaten random people for decades, just for the sport of it. This cathartic recreation has been dubbed wilding, catch and wreck , knock out game or flash mob, and it can happen at parks, shopping malls, state fairs or even your living room. In 2012, a mentally-handicapped woman was relaxing on her stoop in Chester, just outside Philadelphia, when she was attacked by six black teenaged girls. When the terrified woman tried to flee inside, they rushed into her living room to continue the savage beating . Had these girls not posted their exhilarating workout on FaceBook, they might never have been caught. - Advertisement - A white bartender at my neighborhood dive was attacked, just outside her front door, by a group of black kids around 12 years old. After throwing a rock at her head and knocking her down, they kicked her a few times as she curled up on the ground, then they scattered. ""Just like that, it was over. All I could do was go inside and cry."" Not surprisingly, the latest incident at Temple University has received scant media attention. Though AP did cover it, it never pointed out that these were racial crimes. As usual, only ""teens"" are fingered, with their race not mentioned. Had mobs of whites attacked random blacks, the entire world would have known about it by now. Locally, a black writer editorializes in the Philadelphia Inquirer that gentrification is ultimately responsible.

Russian S-500 Anti-ballistic missile system Question #1. Is ""Full Spectrum Dominance"", the Pentagon's ambitious plan to have military control over the land, sea, air and outer space, a mirage? Question #2. Has the plan been effectively neutralized by Russia's advanced technology in missile defense systems and superior early warning detection capability? Reading Pepe Escobar's latest, ""Russia Calls the War Party's Bluff"" [1] , he doesn't refer directly to the Pentagon's plan to exercise ""Full Spectrum Dominance"" yet he does mention the S-500 anti-missile system effectively seals Russia's air space . Escobar quoting a US intel source, ""The United States has lost the arms race, indulging in trillions of dollars of worthless wars...no longer a global power as it cannot defend itself with its obsolete missiles, THAAD, Patriot, and Aegis Land Based Ballistic Defense System, against Russian ICBM's, even as the Russian's have sealed their air space. The Russian's may be as much as four generations ahead of the US"". Hmm...""Full Spectrum Dominance""? Back to that in a bit. Escobar's primary focus is on Syria and the Russian S-300, 400 missile systems brought to Syria now operational on land and sea which he says, ""Russia has basically made their own no-fly zone over Syria; and a US no-fly zone is now impossible to achieve"". That effectively neutralizes any future plans the Obama administration has in mind as well as a new Hillary Clinton regime in waiting contemplating such an idea; something she's been pushing during the presidential campaign against Trump. This much seems clear. Russian President Vladimir Putin has chosen to make a stand militarily and diplomatically -the latter shouldn't be forgotten-to support Syrian President Bashar Assad's government against the assorted Pentagon, CIA, Saudi Arabia, Turkey, GCC backed proxy mercenary jihadist terrorists trained and supported by them then brought to Syria to bring about regime change. - Advertisement - With Russia entrenched in Syria regime change isn't going to happen. The current siege against the terrorists by Assad's Syrian Arab Army supported by Russian air power in eastern Aleppo continues. Meanwhile over the border in Mosul, Iraq a battle is raging to extricate IS terrorists that have controlled the city since 2014 when it routed the Iraqi army. Now an unlikely conglomeration of Shiite militia's, Sunni tribesmen, Peshmerga Kurds, Turkish army, Iraqi army, US special forces supported by US planes are besieging the city. In all likelihood when IS loses control of Mosul its remaining forces will retreat into eastern Syria becoming a new force presumably used by the US as the newest proxy force to take on Assad. This hasn't occurred yet so the focus by Assad's SAA forces is retaking and freeing the Syrian people in besieged Eastern Aleppo. Back to the original premise of this piece, the Pentagon's Full Spectrum Dominance, FSD. Nothing is really secret anymore. - Advertisement - Russia and China had to know the Pentagon's FSD plan from its inception. They had to know it was mandatory to develop and upgrade their ballistic missile technology to effectively neutralize any US plan to initiate a nuclear first strike-something that's still on the table while Russia and China have rejected the idea. Regrettably, we're in a new cold war with Russia and China. And despite some fiery rhetoric from Hillary Clinton, ""Putin's the new Hitler, wanting a no-fly zone over Syria"" and her generalized disposition to show how tough she is, there should be enough reality based resistance coming from the military, intel agencies that should short circuit any aggressive moves she has in mind that would bring any direct confrontation with Russia and China, whether in Syria, Ukraine, the South China Sea or anywhere else that could escalate into a nuclear confrontation. In conclusion the madness of initiating a nuclear first strike against Russia and China is being effectively neutralized by Russian ABM, ICBM superiority now evidenced in Syria making the Pentagon's Full Spectrum Dominance a mirage, including for Hillary ""mad dog"" Clinton.",1
The Geniuses Who Brought You the Iraq War Are at It Again,"License DMCA 
The following was originally published in The Nation 
The ""Blob"" -- the epithet Obama speechwriter Ben Rhodes used to scorn Washington's inbred, vainglorious, bipartisan foreign-policy elite -- is striking back. In a series of foreign policy reports designed to influence the incoming administration, Greg Jaffe of The Washington Post reveals , the Blob will publicly criticize Obama's ""reluctance"" to exercise America's military prowess and call for a more ""muscular,"" ""interventionist,"" assertive policy, from the South China Sea to the Russian border, but particularly in the Middle East. They are pumping for more war. 
The names are familiar -- former secretary of state Madeline Albright and former Bush national security adviser Stephen Hadley lead the Atlantic Council task force. Former Bill Clinton NSC adviser Brian Katulis and former Bush deputy secretary of defense Rudy deLeon are senior fellows at the Center for American Progress. The inescapable Martin Indyk heads a Brookings group of former top officials from Obama, Bush, and Clinton administrations. 
These are the apostles of American exceptionalism, from the neoconservatives who promoted the invasion of Iraq to the ""indispensable nation"" liberal interventionists who championed regime change in Libya. Virtually without exception, all supported Bush's invasion of Iraq, the most catastrophic foreign policy debacle since Vietnam. Virtually without exception, none were held accountable for that folly. 
The reports -- and the Blob -- share two conclusions. They censure Obama for excessive timidity. ""There's a widespread perception that not being active enough or recognizing the limits of American power has costs,"" the Post quotes Philip Gordon, a senior foreign-policy adviser to Obama until 2015. ""So the normal swing is to be more interventionist."" - Advertisement - 
And all favor ramping up US military activity -- on the Russian borders, in the South China Sea, and particularly in the Middle East, promoting no-fly and safe zones in Syria, more special forces, more aggressive use of air power, more military aid, and a more integrated security partnership. The objective is not only to defeat ISIS and Al Qaeda and its offshoots militarily, but to create order in war torn Iraq, Syria, Yemen, Libya, and Somalia, as well as to counter Iran and Russia in the region. 
The Obama years demonstrate the dangers of ""restraint""? Say what? The Obama administration is currently fighting wars in five countries and bombing seven. It toppled Gaddafi in Libya and left the country in chaos. Its regime change campaign in Syria ended in a brutal civil war. It backs the Saudi ravaging of Yemen. It helped spark a street coup in Ukraine, and moved military forces to the Russian border, reviving a new Cold War. It has bolstered US naval forces in the South China Sea as part of containing China. US Special Forces were active in more than 100 countries last year. Obama has signed off on more weapons sales and transfers than Bush. None of this has worked out very well, but neither did George W. Bush's ""damn the torpedoes"" policy. If Obama represents excessive restraint, may the gods save us from what comes next. 
The Blob still believes that America has the writ and the power to decide. We are ""indispensable,"" bearers of law and democracy at the end of a cruise missile. Our insurgents are by definition ""moderates."" Our clients -- Israel, Egypt, Saudi Arabia, Jordan, Turkey, the United Arab Emirates, Oman, from military dictatorship to desert sheikdom -- have, in the words of the CAP Report, ""internal cohesion"" and domestic ""political legitimacy."" Despite conflicting interests, they are allies against terror (even though some like Saudi Arabia provide significant funding for both the terrorists and the religious zealots that inspire them.) 
For the Blob, caution comes not in objective but in strategy. Only the most unhinged call for putting ""boots on the ground."" This leads to a disconnect. They limit the military strategy -- to drones, air power, advisers, intelligence cooperation, military aid, training -- without trimming the objectives. It is hard to see this as anything other than a demented recipe for endless wars without victory. 
In this age of bitter partisanship, characterized by unrelenting Republican obstructionism in Congress and now Trump's stoking America's rancors, much attention has been paid to the dangers of division. But the utter failure of the center and the bipartisan elite has been neglected. In the Middle East and elsewhere, the Blob has driven us into one folly after another. Yet they still fill the highest offices and the most lavishly appointed think tanks. And they are still calling for more. - Advertisement - 
America's civilizing movements -- civil rights, women's, LGBT, the DREAMers -- have transformed this country. An emerging populist movement -- Occupy Wall Street, Bernie Sanders, the Fight for 15, fair-trade and financial-reform campaigns and more -- is on the march.

"What is an ""income"" tax and where did it come from? NOT the 16th Amendment!","License DMCA The financial system in America is a scam of world proportion. All of our lives, we've been taught, and often reminded, that the so-called ""income"" tax originated with the 16th Amendment in 1913, and authorized a tax on our earnings. The IRS repeatedly claims this as their authority to tax American's wages, but is this true? Have YOU ever looked into the evidence and history of this tax to see if you actually owe such a tax, or actually even receive ""income""? Most Americans will have to say, no they haven't. So, we simply plod on taking what we've been told as true and factual, and comply by voluntarily assessing ourselves every year without another thought... except that we hate having to do it unless it is to get back some or all of what should never have been taken in the first place. With the advent of the personal computer and the internet, things have changed. What once took many months or even years of research in law libraries and other sources of actual documents now takes days or weeks... perhaps months, and what is being discovered is not only revealing, it is shocking. Is it possible that we have been deceived for over 100 years on the topic of our financial system and ""income"" taxes? Let's start with in ""income"" tax. What does the 16th Amendment actually tell us? ""The Congress shall have power to lay and collect taxes on incomes, from whatever source derived, without apportionment among the several states, and without regard to any census or enumeration."" The key words in this amendment are ""incomes"" and ""whatever source derived"". ""Income"" is the one which is grossly misunderstood. We will come back to what this amendment is actually speaking to further down in this article. First, we must realize how millions of people can be deceived... ""When a well-packaged web of lies has been sold gradually to the masses over generations, the truth will seem utterly preposterous and its speaker a raving lunatic."" Dresden James. It's time we look carefully at the evidence of historical records and decide if this is the ravings of a lunatic, or simply a message based on actual evidence that has, at best, been misunderstood, or at worst, purposefully suppressed and manipulated for many decades. Reader beware: This will likely fundamentally change your outlook on things if you are willing to actually take the time to understand this fraud. It may seem boring and of little interest to you right here and now, but I can assure you, if you want truth, you most likely won't want to put this down until you've completed the series. Let's begin with the 16th Amendment's claimed source for the income tax. If you take a look at page iii of the preface to the 1939 Internal Revenue Code, ( click here ), you will see reference to the now standing tax laws being enacted as far back as July 1, 1862, and carried forward to today. - Advertisement - Huge portions of our modern body of lawful ""income"" tax law pre-dates the 16th Amendment. Congress published a comprehensive ""Derivation of Code Sections of the Internal Revenue Code of 1939 and 1954"" table ( click here ), dated January 21, 1992, which explicitly identifies the pre-16th origins of these still-current statutes. (Highlighted sections within pages 20-76). It must also be noted that the 1986 Internal Revenue Code is based on these enactments and is still in place today. Throughout the Derivation table, you will see that there are well over 300 examples of the pre-1913 16th Amendment throughout, proving that the ""income"" tax was not ""enacted"" through the 16th Amendment. So, we now have to ask a couple questions and look for the plain answers in the record. The first question is ""If there is substantial evidence that the income tax was not ""enacted"" in 1913, and no such tax on American's wages existed (at least for very long as it was declared unconstitutional) prior to the 16th Amendment, what law actually authorizes a tax on American's wages?"" The answer is, there is no actual law. Is there supporting evidence of this fact? Let the U.S. Supreme Court tell us the facts from those days; ""The Sixteenth Amendment to the Constitution has not enlarged the taxing power of Congress..."" This is brought out clearly by this court in Brushaber v. Union Pacific Railroad Co., 240 U.S. 1, and Stanton v. Baltic Mining Co., 240 U.S. 103. ""We are of opinion, however, that the confusion is not inherent, but rather arises from the conclusion that the 16th Amendment provides for a hitherto unknown power of taxation; that is, a power to levy an income tax which, although direct, should not be subject to the regulations of apportionment applicable to all other direct taxes. And the far-reaching effect of this erroneous assumption will be made clear by generalizing the many contentions advanced in argument to support it."" Brushaber v. Union Pac. R.R. Co., 240 U.S. 1, 11, 12, 18 (1916); ""In the former case it was pointed out that the all-embracing power of taxation conferred upon Congress by the Constitution included two great classes, one indirect taxes or excises, and the other direct taxes, and that of apportionment with regard to direct taxes. It was held that the income tax in its nature is an excise; that is, it is a tax upon a person measured by his income . . . It was further held that the effect of the Sixteenth Amendment was not to change the nature of this tax or to take it out of the class of excises to which it belonged, but merely to make it impossible by any sort of reasoning thereafter to treat it as a direct tax because of the sources from which the income was derived."" ([14-15]; Peck & Co. v. Lowe, 247 U.S. 165 (1917). Brief for the Appellant at 11, 14-15; See also Stratton's Independence, LTD. v. Howbert, 231 US 399, 414 (1913)."" (Emphasis added - ""derived from"" discussed below). ""... It manifestly disregards the fact that by the previous ruling it was settled that the provisions of the 16th Amendment conferred no new power of taxation."" Evans vs. Gore, 253 US 245, 263 (1920). ""It was not the purpose or effect of that amendment to bring any new subject within the taxing power."" Bowers v. Kerbaugh-Empire Co., 271 U.S. 170; 46 S.Ct. 449 (1926). - Advertisement - ""... It manifestly disregards the fact that by the previous ruling it was settled that the provisions of the 16th Amendment conferred no new power of taxation."" Evans vs. Gore, 253 US 245, 263 (1920).

Kerbaugh-Empire Co., 271 U.S. 170; 46 S.Ct. 449 (1926); So, if there was no ""new"" tax created by the 16th Amendment, as the Supreme Court has stated over and over again, how can the IRS make our wages ""income"", and how did this tax on our wages begin? The answer comes within the second question we must ask: ""What exactly is 'income?'"" Here is where the deceit so easily enters out lives. U.S. v. Ballard, 535, 575 F. 2D 400 (1976); (see also Oliver v. Halstead, 196 VA 992; 86 S.E. Rep. 2D 858); ""The general term 'income' is not defined in the Internal Revenue Code . . .",1
The Geometry of Energy and Meditation of Buddha,"License DMCA 
A mandala is a visual symbol often utilized in meditation practices and teachings. The mandala symbol itself is a geometric construction of points, lines, planes and solids symbolizing the universe. Mandalas are geometric designs depictive of the universe specifically. Other designs are similarly meditation tools, but may not be mandalas specifically. The visually conceived geometric symbols are visual meditation tools. A visual meditation tool is called a yantra. Mandalas and all other yantras are visual meditation points of concentration. Yantras are visual meditative tools similar in value to points of concentration. The image above is the sri yantra, sri meaning king or most important. 
A mantra is the audio version of a mandala. A mantra is an audio meditation tool. Whether the sound of the mantra is a single syllable tone or a series of lengthy metaphysical musings, a mantra is an audio meditation tool. Mantras, as sound vibration, are wavy linear vibrations of connection. 
The terms asana and mudra both reference physical positioning. An asana is a body posture as a meditation tool, and a mudra is a hand gesture or posture as a meditation tool. Asanas and mudras enable our own bodies to become a geometric representation of a meditation tool. The postures are physical meditation tools transforming self into one's own geometric figure or plane among the space and sensitive to the space of self and surroundings. 
Tantra means unification, or looming/weaving together principles and practices, instruction and individual action. Tantra unites entirety. Tantra signifies confluence and integration; a fusion. It is Sanskrit for loom, the device which weaves together string into cloth. It is an ancient word with many properties and has been variously used to describe the knots of strings weaved together in a rug, and the cord on which sacred mala bead necklaces were strung, (Mala beads are Tibetan prayer necklaces of 108 beads used to assist mentally or vocally repeating a mantra 108 times.) and practices of unification of individual with the universal. Today the word tantra is often used in reference to the union of lovemaking. Though there is also a specific type of yoga called Tantra Yoga it means unification. 
There is the potentiation of the unification of principle and practice. There is the potentiation of tantra of yantra, mantra and asana. And there is certainly the lesson of the potentiation of Yin Yang tantra. The combination of Yin and Yang potentials and energies within leads to all sorts of aspects of development. This can be energetically understood in the idea that there are only two types of energies, straight and circular, straight for Yang potentials and circular for Yin potentials. It can be understood on a tangible level that rest and work are both required. When straight and circular energies combine, a spiral results. A spiral is one of, if not the highest expressions of energy. 
More broadly and generally, tantra notes a mutually accepted connection, a tied knot of intertwined being, like lovemaking, but not necessarily beginning with or limited to the act of lovemaking. Humanity itself is a tantra; a fused weaving knot or many strings, of many instructions and many individuals. - Advertisement - 
Essentially tantra is spiritual understanding of the relationship and connections between individuation and universal energies. An ancient spiritual philosophy preceding both Buddhism and Hinduism, tantra represents integration, unifying the macrocosm with the microcosm, the universal and the individual, the feminine and the masculine, the Yin and the Yang. It also refers to integrative knowledge and its continuation and building refinement through the interaction of teacher and student, signifying union and fusion; the acceptance, integration and transmutation of knowledge between individuals, like the string of life. 
Tantric ideas enhance and explore metaphysical merging of ideas and energies. Tantra is the merging of the physical and spiritual, through the merging of the conceptual. In essence, Tantra is the integration of yantra (the philosophy of visual symbols), mantra (communication of audio symbolism) and mudra (our very physical posturing) each of which is important on their own and increasing so when intertwined aspects of yoga, and life. Tantra unites meditation practices and enhances the individual unity expansion with entirety of the universal. 
There is not necessarily the need for a specific yantra, or specific mantra, or specific asana in meditation, however each are tools that can be used and considered, and most are most powerful when practiced in unified tantric manner, or tantric mind state. A tantric mind state recognizes unity expansion and aims toward it, rather than cultivating a mind state of separation. 
No matter how one approaches meditation the unifying tantra of our meditation principles and practices bring about the unity expansion of yantra no matter. No matter our level of refinement of posture, we are always in an asana, no matter if we utilize mantra, or yantra, we for th most part still see and hear and those who cannot can still concentrate and connect. And no matter the mantra, yantra or asana, it is the principles behind and pertaining to the symbolism that contains the real power, the highest potential for tantric connection. Yantras, mantras and asanas establish your sacred space and sacred perimeter and uniting with entirety in tantric balance. 
Seed of Buddha Meditation - Advertisement - 
One of my favorite meditations relates to the four dimensions of geometry, but is extracted from Buddhist lessons. It is one of the most powerful meditations I have learned and as I learned it, Buddha himself practiced and taught this meditation. I learned this meditation from a Tibetan Buddhist monk from Nepal before I considered the four dimensions of geometry applied to meditation. On later examination however the components of the meditation relate to the four dimensions of geometry. 
This meditation is direct and simple, but can lead to infinitely complex profound lessons. The profundity of each of the ideas in this meditation cannot be understated. And each of the concepts has been elaborated on endlessly for centuries since Buddha, and so the presentation here is of course a simplification of the ideas and processes that might be endlessly explored and refined. And that is what meditation is all about really, our own personal inward exploration and refinement. 
To begin, sit in a comfortable cross legged position on a meditation pillow. Sit for a time to simply settle into absorption and relaxation, focusing on the breath. The rhythm of the following meditation consists of mindfulness of an idea followed by mindfulness of no idea, where as much as possible we think on nothingness. The nothingness gives us a chance to relax, compared to processing the series of ideas which can all be quite intense. The process can be done in any time period. The point is to cover each idea as deeply as can be, given time or mental state circumstances. 
The meditation is formed from important Buddhist concepts. Many meditations are derived from such teachings, Buddhist and otherwise, so that there are lessons in a sense for the secular, and meditation practitioners.",1
Transforming hope into reality for patients of drug-resistant TB,"Shobha Shukla, Citizen News Service - CNS Hope for shorter and more effective new TB drugs License DMCA Multidrug-resistant TB (MDR-TB) remains a public health crisis. As per WHO's Global TB Report 2016, 480,000 people fell ill with MDR-TB in 2015, with 3 countries - India, China, and Russia - carrying the major burden and together accounting for nearly half of all MDR-TB cases globally. Detection and treatment gaps continue to plague the MDR-TB response. In 2015, only 1 out of every 5 people needing treatment for MDR-TB were able to access it and only 52% of those who started MDR-TB treatment were cured. ""These sobering statistics remind us of our urgency to continue the fight to develop better, faster and affordable treatments that will finally bring this pandemic under control,"" said Dr Mel Spigelman, CEO of TB Alliance, which is working to advance several promising regimens to tackle all forms of TB. The current MDR-TB regimen lasts for 2 years or more. It includes medicines and injectables that are not only toxic but also come at a cost that is higher than what many patients and healthcare systems can afford. Even the new 9 month MDR-TB regimen that has recently been endorsed by WHO, though shorter, does include 4 months of injectables. However new results from 2 clinical studies conducted by TB Alliance point to an emerging paradigm, where countries may soon have the short, all-oral, and affordable drug regimens needed to treat all people with TB. Late stage clinical results from these two studies were unveiled yesterday at the 47th Union World Conference on Lung Health in Liverpool. The NC-005 study - Advertisement - The NC-005 study investigates an oral, injection free regimen that purports to treat both drug-sensitive and MDR-TB with a short, simple, safe, and affordable treatment. A Phase 2b, 2 month study tested various combinations of BPaMZ--Bedaquiline (B), Pretomanid (Pa), Moxifloxacin (M) and Pyrazinamide (Z). It was conducted at 10 sites in 3 countries (Uganda, South Africa, and Tanzania). A total of 240 patients were enrolled in the study-- 180 patients with drug-sensitive TB received BPaZ and 60 patients with MDR-TB received BPaMZ. The study also investigated a simpler dosing scheme for bedaquiline, which could lead to fewer pills and an overall less complicated treatment for patients. NC-005 showed that the best regimen was a combination of all four drugs, BPaMZ, which was examined in an arm of the trial. Data showed that at the end of 2 months, clinical study participants receiving BPaMZ cleared TB bacteria from their sputum 3 times as quickly as those on the standard treatment regimen. Almost all participants had culture conversion after the 2 months of treatment. This is the fastest rate of culture conversion that has ever been seen and indicates the potential of BPaMZ to treat all forms of TB-drug-sensitive as well as MDR-TB with the same regimen. The regimens appeared safe. The study showed that it was possible to simplify the dosing of Bedaquiline and found that a daily dose of Bedaquiline (200 mg) is at least as active and safe as the labelled dose. This will allow for simpler daily dosing with the regimen and to be combined in a fixed dose combination. The BPaMZ regimen is being tested to see if it can cure the vast majority of TB patients in as less as 3 months. If successful, the regimen could reshape the treatment landscape of TB, especially for people with MDR-TB, who currently face an arduous 9-24 month treatment journey that is too often unsuccessful. The results of NC-005 could pave the way to a global Phase 3 trial. The Nix-TB Study ('Nix' means to put an end to) - Advertisement - It is estimated that 9% of all the MDR-TB patients suffer from extensively drug-resistant TB (XDR-TB) that is resistant to at least four commonly used anti-TB drugs. XDR-TB is often considered a death sentence. Most XDR-TB is not treated at all because of the cost and complexity of the treatment. Of those who do receive treatment, less than one third get cured. In May 2015, TB Alliance and partners launched the world's first clinical study-- the Nix-TB Study-to test a new XDR-TB drug regimen called BPaL, consisting of Bedaquiline (B), Pretomanid (Pa), and Linezolid (L) in patients who have no other treatment options. It is the first study to test an all-oral drug regimen, comprised of drugs with minimal pre-existing resistance, that has the potential to shorten, simplify, and improve treatment for XDR-TB. Nix-TB is an open-label study that is being conducted at 2 sites in South Africa--at Sizwe Hospital in Johannesburg and at Brooklyn Chest Hospital in Cape Town. Additional sites to expand the study are planned. Patients who have XDR-TB, or have failed their current MDR-TB treatment or who have side effects of their current MDR-TB treatment, are enrolled.Till to date, 50 patients have been enrolled in the study, including patients as young as 14 and those who are co-infected with HIV with a CD4 cell count of 50 or higher.",1
"The Politics of Death: Cancer and Politics, a personal story","License DMCA This is not about how politics controls research on cancer and other diseases. It is about a political economy which, in the name of democracy, is killing us.
Today, I got my PSA score (used to assess degree of cancer), and it was not down, after 4 months of a heavy duty cannabis extract treatment and numerous anti-cancer supplements, along with a vegan anti-cancer diet. It didn't go down. After my cancerous prostate was removed 10 years, ago I had nearly 8 yrs cancer free, then two years, ago the score began to rise, from .2 to .4. to .5 to today's .6. 
That is a low score, but it is growing and my treatments have not stopped it. I ask: how can I have got cancer when since age 26, I have been on an organic anti-cancer diet? 
There are two theories, not necessarily incompatible: one asserts, as the man who discovered the cause of cancer did, that the cause is pollution. Dr. Warburg won the Nobel Prize but the Nazis kept him from accepting it. He said pollution caused cancer. 
The other theory is the genetic element: studies on twins seem to show that there is a genetic component, which may not cause cancer but predispose to it, make us vulnerable to the onslaught of pollution. 
So I am going to go with the idea that tho genetics makes some more susceptible, it is pollution which is killing us. 
On a gross level, this is easy to see. Each year, millions die from fossil fuel pollution; in the US, 13,000 die from coal pollution, and tens of millions suffer from air pollution, not to mention water pollution as in Flint, Michagan and many other cities. - Advertisement - 
Why do we have so much pollution? Why haven't we switched to clean energy? Why haven't we banned fossil fuels, which are poisons we eat and drink and breath every day? 
We know that pollution kills, makes sick, decreases productivity, increases healthcare costs, makes us suffer and destroys the environment, including climate disruption? Why is nothing being done? 
The reason is simple: politics. The oligarchy is made up of those who profit from pollution, from the energy industry to the ag industry. In a democracy, these corporations which are killing us would be stopped. 
But in an oligarchy where the polluters rule, all action is to prevent action; private profits trump public safety. Money trumps human health. Accumulating billions is more important than protecting the earth. This is a political decision, within a system of oligarchic rule. We are being killed by cancer because the ruling class has hijacked government and made effective regulation impossible. We are being killed by design, since the fossil fuel elites know the damage their products do. 
And so, as I ponder my next treatment (probably immunotherapy), I ask everyone to consider how our politics, mostly right wing, Republican, pro-corporate but including the establishment Democrats. Clinton, for instance, has received 7 million from the fossil fuel people this year. Clinton is also on record of supporting fracking. - Advertisement - 
Here is what Sanders said of her in April: """"Well, when you vote for virtually every trade agreement that has cost the workers of this country millions of jobs, when you support and continue to support fracking, despite the crisis that we have in terms of clean water,"" he said April 10, ""and essentially, when you have a super PAC that is raising tens of millions of dollars from every special interest out there, including $15 million from Wall Street, the American people do not believe that that is the kind of president that we need to make the changes in America to protect the working families of this country."" 
Politifact concludes that ""Clinton's past support of fracking is well documented."" 
And so it is not only the Republican's who are blocking action to reduce the damage done by fossil fuels; it is also the Democrats, who are bribed with millions to continue the status quo. Now Clinton says she wants solar on every roof. That is easy to say, and it will get some Bernie supporters to accept her. But her history is of defending the fossil fuel industry. And history trumps hypotheticals. Early detection means early treatment License DMCA Conclusion: pollution is killing us. Both parties have protected this lethal industry to varying degrees. It seems, as with so much else, that if we want change, if we want to stop killing ourselves with toxins in our air and food and water, we will have to finally end the rule of the oligarchs and establish a democratic nation, where the leaders lead in ending pollution and transforming us to clean energy and with it, better health for our families and our earth.",1
Why We Wait For The Future,"opednews.com - Advertisement - 
I have suggested elsewhere that if we want a better future we will have to create it out of whole cloth and intend that it be 'for the highest and best good for all concerned and the planet'. 
Most of us know that two things cannot occupy the same space at the same time. The time, space thing that is our planetary reality is occupied by dark, evil, powerful forces with no intention of moving aside to accommodate positive outcomes. 
Carl Jung has noted that ""the opposite of love is not hate, it is power"". I get this. Love nourishes and empowers the object of its attention, power seeks dominion over what it notices, is destructive. We cannot confront this power and it would be karmically harmful to do so resulting in no change. 
So, the existent power, in play for 300,000 years, must 'start' to break down before change is possible, to allow space for that change. If we want to be in control of that change we must be the dominate unified conscious intent during the breakdown of order and focus that positive intend toward a better future. 
The breakdown of order is in play right now in front of our eyes .It is remarkable and noteworthy that the U.S., the evil empire has leveled most of the Middle East, used depleted uranium weaponry in Iraq causing severe genetic damage to newborns for generations, has driven millions of hapless refugees into Europe and I hear no loud, clear voice screaming for them,us, to stop. I have just described an 'end of times, type horror story the evil doers who run the U.S. are engaged in and plan to expand around the globe. They actually plan and promote the breakdown of order, the chaos out of which they expect to rise with an absolute grip on all power. They expect us to welcome this enslavement just to stop the pain and suffering they have caused us. Again, this madness is taking place right now in front of our eyes. 
If the decent and responsible among us organize now to be that dominate unified intent, the dominate consciousness , we would control the aftermath of the planned breakdown of order. Our rulers do not imagine us capable of this since we have behaved like victims who always attract and suffer victimizers to their lives. - Advertisement - 
So that's it. We need about ten percent of us to to lightly hold the intent to create the new paradigm of existence and hold this vision while chaos descends around us. If this is an effort by 'enough' of us we will prevail. The Law of Attraction, the first universal law will assist us and attract more positive energy than thought possible. The planet herself is considered a conscious being and would certainly direct all possible positive energy to our cause-her cause. As our energy grows the energy available to evil wanes. When they sense this their testicles will shrink! 
Finally, no one need give their life to this cause rather a commitment to prevail not founded solely on self interest and a real sense of responsibility to humankind and the planet. 
The breakdown of order has begun.... - Advertisement -",1
Egyptian kangaroo court confirms 20-year-prison sentence on Morsi,"(7 fans) - Advertisement - Amid mounting anger against the US-client government of Field Marshal Abdel Fattah Al-Sisi because of tax rises, soaring food prices, inflation and cuts in state subsidies, a kangaroo court in Cairo has confirmed a 20-year prison sentence against Mohamed Morsi, the first democratically elected President who was deposed by Al-Sisi in July 2013. 
In April 2015, a Cairo court had sentenced Morsi to 20 years in prison for inciting violence against protesters who had staged a sit-in outside the Ittihadiya presidential palace in December 2012, when Morsi was still in power. 
Twenty-year jail sentences were also confirmed against other senior figures from Morsi's Muslim Brotherhood, including Mohamed el-Beltagy and Essam el-Erian. The men were convicted in April 2015 on charges including kidnapping, torture and the killings of protesters during unrest in 2012. 
Morsi, elected in 2012 and overthrown in 2013, is facing several trials. After a controversial trial, he was sentenced to death in May 2015 for allegedly participating in violence against the police during the 2011 uprising against former President Hosni Mubarak, but his court appointed lawyers have appealed that verdict. 
An Egyptian court cancelled the life sentences on Tuesday (Oct 25) handed out to former president Mohamed Morsi and Muslim Brotherhood chief Mohamed Badie along with 15 other leaders of the banned group in an espionage case and ordered a retrial. 
The court also cancelled death sentences handed out to 16 other Muslim Brotherhood members, including top leaders Khyrat el-Sharer and Mohamed el-Beltagy Ahmed Abdel Aty. Thirteen of the 16 were sentenced in absentia. The defendants were accused of spying, funding terrorism and disclosing national security. 
Turkey's president, Tayyip ErdoÄan, had criticized the death sentence for Morsi and accused the west of hypocrisy. ""The popularly elected president of Egypt, chosen with 52% of the vote, has unfortunately been sentenced to death,"" ErdoÄan said at a rally in Istanbul. 
""Egypt is turning back into ancient Egypt,"" he said, referring to the Pharaonic rule of the land that ended more than two millennia ago. ""The west, unfortunately, is still turning a blind eye to Sisi's coup,"" he added. ""While they abolished the death penalty in their own countries, they just look on as spectators at this execution in Egypt."" - Advertisement - 
Morsi, who has also been sentenced to 25 years in prison after being convicted of leaking state secrets to Qatar, has not appointed a lawyer to defend himself and has refused to recognize the legitimacy of the court proceedings, saying he remains Egypt's legitimate president. 
The Muslim Brotherhood has been blamed for the unrest in Egypt, which has resulted in the death of hundreds of people. Al-Sisi's government designated the Muslim Brotherhood a terrorist group in December 2013, making even verbal expressions of support punishable by imprisonment. 
Hundreds of people have been sentenced to death in a crackdown following Morsi's overthrow. Seven have been executed, including six defendants sentenced to death by a military court for allegedly participating in militant attacks. 
More than three years after Sisi ousted Morsi, his promise to restore stability is wearing thin. Desperation and anger among Egyptians is mounting due to increase in food prices, while the double-digit inflation rate squeezes poor Egyptians. 
According to the Middle East Monitor, core inflation is at seven-year-highs, near 14 percent, as a foreign exchange shortage and a hike in customs duties bite hard in a country that imports everything from sugar to luxury cars. The government raised electricity prices by 25-40 percent in August and is phasing in a 13 percent value-added tax approved by parliament in the same month. - Advertisement - 
As part of reforms aimed at clinching a $12 billion IMF loan needed to plug its gaping budget deficit, the government is also expected to cut petrol subsidies and devalue the Egyptian pound, prompting a further cycle of inflation in Egypt, where tens of millions rely on state-subsidized bread, the Middle East Monitor said adding: ""Dollar rationing at banks has driven businesses toward the black market where the dollar is now selling for more than 15.5 pounds -- a huge mark-up from the official rate of about 8.8. Rumors have spread that Friday Nov. 11 will be a day of protest over economic conditions, the Middle East Monitor reported. Police have already detained about 70 people for inciting protests, accusing many of loyalty to the banned Muslim Brotherhood.",1
"Why Donald Trump is not as horrible as Hillary Clinton "" and why you should vote for Jill Stein.","OpEdNews Op Eds 10/28/2016 at 12:50:20 Why Donald Trump is not as horrible as Hillary Clinton "" and why you should vote for Jill Stein. Permalink (Page 1 of 2 pages) License DMCA 
I could have named this article ""Damage Control"" -- because it essentially is about that, related to the lobotomizing dilemma of ""lesser evil voting"". 
But let me be clear at the outset. I have already voted for Jill Stein . I had no other choice. I am firm in my conviction that to vote for sociopathic, narcissistic, self-serving, ruthless, guileful corporatists is an unconscionable act and a major crime against my country, irrespective of the convoluted rationalization which might attempt to justify it. 
Now let me offer reasoning that goes beyond my ""morally pure"" posturing. 
The accepted wisdom is that a vote for Jill Stein is a vote for Donald Trump. This analysis purports that anyone voting for Stein would likely be a former Clinton supporter, and such a vote would subtract from Clinton's total. 
Even though Hillary's elitist, warmongering, anti-democratic, demonstrably criminal world view is diametrically the opposite of Jill Stein's, and I can't imagine anyone who's moved by the Green Party's agenda for the briefest moment being fooled by Clinton's phony populism, for argument's sake I'll accept this proposition. 
While I consider both Trump and Clinton to be equally unfit for office, I do not for a moment believe they would be equally ineffective. - Advertisement - 
Hillary has for good reason become the choice of the oligarchs, the MIC, the bankers, the media, the people who actually run the country. She will serve them well. She knows her way around the system -- she's been gaming it most of her adult life -- and has all the right connections. Which is why even many prominent Republicans have joined the feeding frenzy and flocked to her like vultures over fresh kill. 
Hillary will continue her faux-populist bloviating to keep the stinky masses in line, while her closest allies, the rich and powerful, continue to loot the Treasury, hollow out what's left of the U.S. economy, and bankrupt the middle and lower classes. 
Much to the delight of the neocon-infested Department of State, Department of Defense, security agencies, MIC, and media, Hillary will ""get tough"" with Russia and China, press the war on Syria and the rest of the Middle East , promote and spread more chaos, death, and destruction across the globe in pursuit of military conquest, ultimately world empire. It'll be good for business and pumping up the already inflated egos of the exceptionalists. 
On the other hand, Trump will fall flat on his face. His trademark bull-in-a-china-shop approach to making deals has no chance of success in Washington DC. He has no support -- his own party has all but disowned him -- no connections, at least not the political ones necessary for promoting his agenda. Yes, the politicos drank his champagne and ate the food at his extravagant bashes. Who wouldn't? But they don't owe him anything. Nada! Trump's much heralded talents for making great deals will confront hostile Democrats, contemptuous Republicans -- a perhaps long-overdue bipartisanship -- closing ranks to isolate and defeat the outrageous and vulgar outsider who thought he could buy and muscle his way into political power. License DMCA - Advertisement - 
He'll try to build his wall. When Congress gets done with it, it'll be a 200-foot white picket fence in Calexico . He'll attempt rapprochement with Russia. That will be sabotaged with a false flag attack, maybe dressing some disgruntled maquiladora workers as Russian infantry men and mounting an invasion on the U.S. -- probably in Calexico -- or by John McCain threatening to fall on a grenade or blow his brains out in the Senate chambers if America doesn't immediately nuke Moscow . 
Despite his self-proclaimed success in the business world, Trump simply does not know the rules of the game in Washington DC. Unless he ""fires"" everyone -- declaring martial law and sending all members of the legislature to a FEMA labor camp in Montana -- he will either be the most ineffective president in history or be impeached. Maybe both! 
In a phrase, Donald Trump as president will do 'less damage'. 
Anyone who has read my recent writings knows that my greatest concern about a Hillary Clinton presidency is her truculent foreign policy . A decade ago, I might have believed that she was misguided. Now I realize -- as quite a number of others do -- that she is completely insane. She's become drunk on power, poisoned by surrounding herself with neocons and warmongering humanitarians , possessed by visions of herself as the Warrior Queen.",1
California's Death Penalty: Mike Ramos v. Kevin Cooper and Proposition 62,"Mike Ramos and Kevin Cooper: Who tells the truth?(image by public domain) License DMCA San Bernardino County District Attorney Mike Ramos obtained the controversial capital conviction of Kevin Cooper, whose ""clemency"" petition to Governor Jerry Brown gravely puts at issue the integrity of Ramos' office. Already campaigning to be the state's Attorney General in 2018, Ramos speaks out for Proposition 66, which promises to accelerate the death penalty. Ramos attacks opponents of the death penalty as deceptive. However, recognizing that the main problem is the California Supreme Court's automatic appeal bottleneck, Ramos at best carelessly misrepresents that Proposition 66 redirects first appeals to the courts of appeal. 
This article presents excerpts concerning Kevin Cooper's case from the first part of an in-progress two-part paper, California's Death Penalty: People v. Masters v. The California Supreme Court's Carefulness Con . Earlier excerpts are presented in my OEN article, California's Death Penalty: The California Supreme Court's Carefulness Con . A further article will provide an in-depth presentation of People v. Masters , 62 Cal.4 th 1019 (2016). 
If California's death penalty is not repealed in November by Proposition 62, next up on California's ready-to-kill list (now comprising about 12 inmates) is Kevin Cooper . In 2009, by a vote of 16-11, an en banc Ninth Circuit panel let stand Cooper's death sentence. However, in a voluminous opinion , [1] beginning with the statement that ""[t]he State of California may be about to execute an innocent man,"" five of the dissenters passionately protested that the district court had not complied with the circuit's prior injunction to have a conclusive blood test performed. 
To prove family-murdered-by-hatchet charges, the state introduced a T-shirt stained with Cooper's blood (plus other suspect evidence, such as mysteriously materialized cigarette butts). Cooper protested that the blood stain must have been added by the prosecution, using a sample kept in a test tube. When checked, the test tube was full, but had apparently been tampered with. Cooper claimed that the tube must have been topped up with someone else's blood. Sure enough, the blood of two people was found in the tube. In due course, the Ninth Circuit enjoined the federal district court to have the T-shirt stain tested for preservative, so as to conclusively determine whether it had come from the sample. The laboratory duly reported that the stain contained preservative. However, the district court then allowed the laboratory to reattribute its finding to likely laboratory contamination, without requiring a retest . [2] - Advertisement - 
Besides such apparent fabrications, there were plain suppressions. Investigators paid no heed to witnesses who had seen three white people, at least one blood-stained, fleeing the scene in the primary victim's car. One of them had lost a T-shirt and a hatchet--his blood-stained pants were incinerated by the police. See From FBI Boss to Death Penalty Foe, Tom Parker's Quest to Free a Convicted Murderer , Santa Barbara Independent, Jul. 6, 2016: [H]aving put the Mafia behind bars, investigated dozens of homicides and sent two murderers to their deaths . . . during 45 years in law enforcement, Parker said he's seen too many corrupt homicide investigations to believe in the death penalty anymore. The worst of them, he said, is the Chino Hills murder case of 1983. . . ""Kevin was a car thief and a burglar, but he doesn't deserve to be where he is,"" Parker said. ""I'm convinced he was framed."" . . . The courts have called the evidence against Cooper ""overwhelming"" -- spots of Cooper's blood in the Ryens' hallway and on a tan T-shirt by the road; bloody prints of prison-issue Keds inside and outside the Ryens' house; Cooper's cigarette butts in the Ryens' station wagon; and a hatchet sheath and prison uniform button at Cooper's hideout next door. But Cooper claims this was false evidence, planted and manipulated by the San Bernardino County Sheriff's Department to convict him. He alleges that sheriff's deputies destroyed evidence and ignored leads pointing to three white men as the murderers -- including the initial statements of the Ryens' eight-year-old son, Josh, the sole survivor. 
Victim relatives and friends, police, and prosecutors naturally insist that there is not even any lingering doubt as to guilt, [3] and they protest inordinate appellate delay. But to objective observers, Cooper's case raises deep concerns as to prosecutorial prejudice and California Supreme Court carelessness. The case is politically and racially highly charged, not only owing to the heinous nature of the purportedly black-on-white mass-murder, but also owing to the blind eye that police and prosecutor turned to the plain evidence of white culprits. 
The incriminating evidence in Cooper is almost wholly physical, depending entirely on local police testimony for its foundation. Cooper would seem a sympathetic defendant, being a mere car-thief minimum security prison walk-out, lonely and homeward bound for the holidays. Cooper raises grave questions as to the police fabricating DNA and other physical evidence, while destroying, ignoring, or corrupting unfavorable DNA, other physical evidence, and witnesses. Cooper has raised the very highest level of international concern (continuing the above quote): - Advertisement - Last fall, the influential Inter-American Commission on Human Rights, an autonomous organ of the Organization of American States, recommended that Cooper be granted a reprieve, pending a new investigation. Citing in part Parker's allegations of ""endemic tunnel vision,"" the commission concluded that the U.S. had violated Cooper's rights to a fair trial, due process and equality before the law. The U.S. is a signatory to the American Declaration, a treaty that guarantees those rights. 
Cooper's last hope lies in an unorthodox ""clemency"" petition to Governor Brown, seeking not a pardon but an independent non-judicial investigation of the evidence, and a stay of execution pending its outcome. Commuting Cooper's sentence to life without parole does not seem a viable alternative, given that he has been tried twice, and Cal. Constitution, Art. 5, sec. 8 provides that ""[t]he Governor may not grant a pardon or commutation to a person twice convicted of a felony except on recommendation of the Supreme Court, 4 judges concurring."" Moreover, Cooper's incarceration for life would almost as loudly cry out for a conclusive finding as to whether the T-shirt blood stain was fabricated; and because Cooper's actual innocence is the underlying issue, a repeal of the state death penalty in November's election would not moot his petition, which the ABA extraordinarily supports: In a letter sent to Gov. Brown on March 14, the American Bar Association alleged Cooper's ""arrest, prosecution and conviction are marred by evidence of racial bias, police misconduct, evidence tampering, suppression of exculpatory information, lack of quality defense counsel and a hamstrung court system."" [4] 
It seems a toss-up whether Brown will grant the petition, given that he previously gave absurd reasons for vetoing a simple bipartisan measure to mitigate a surfeit of prosecutorial misconduct. [5] To grant it would surely require that the T-shirt blood stain be retested for preservatives, and this would seem to risk scientifically confirming premeditated, deadly, and racial misconduct, implicating police and perhaps the crime laboratory and prosecutor's office.",1
The Matrix of Four of The Medicine Wheel,"Sacred Medicine Wheel of Four Brothers(image by open) DMCA ""The elders knew peace would not come on the Earth until the circle of humanity is complete; until all four colors sat in the circle and shared their teachings."" The sacred medicine wheel of the four directions is for all extents and purposes a mandala, a visual depiction of the universe, our Earth and our inner universe . It's symbolism is simple and primal, and through these qualities it is powerful and meaningful. Representing the intersection of duality and polarity , four is recognized as symbol for completion. In nature this symbolism is illustrated in the cycle of four seasons -- spring, summer, winter and fall -- derived from the flow of cycles between two solstices and two equinoxes of our orbit, as well as the elements of nature: air, fire, water and earth. Four is also reflected in the four aspects of the self: the mental, physical, spiritual and emotional. Mathematically, the symbolism of four it is represented in the four forms of arithmetic (addition, subtraction, multiplication and division) while philosophically, comprehensive human thinking encompasses four dimensions: the thesis (is it so?), antithesis (is it not so?), synthesis (are both so?) and nullesis (are neither so?) Correspondingly, this matrix of four is presented in the beginning of practically every creation story, from Genesis to the Popol Vuh (the Mayan creation story). Nearly all creation stories start with the polarities of Heaven and Earth, and male and female. In this respect, this matrix of four is the basis of most creation stories as well as being depicted in every cross-like symbol shared by so many religions (the Christian cross, the Hindu swastika, the Egyptian ankh etc.) The four Vedas (Sanskrit for ""knowledge"") are the foundational scriptures in Hindu theology, while the cross symbol adopted by Christianity, Judaism and Islam, its presence in the creation story, and its basis in the four worlds of the Kabbalah reflect its major significance to those teachings. Indeed, all peoples share traditions that include the symbolism of four directly (or subtlety) as part of their core belief systems -- as I explore in detail in the article, The Common Origin of Religions and Theology . And it is this universality of the cross symbol and the unanimous celebration of the matrix of four, symbolically and philosophically, in Hindu, Taoist, Native American, Egyptian, Celtic and Judeo-Christian theology and symbolism that most clearly illustrates its commonality to human spirituality and understanding of our world. - Advertisement - But perhaps no group has lived so completely in unity and reverence to the seasonal cycles of Earth Mother and the universal system, as the indigenous peoples of Turtle Island, now known as North America. Most significantly, the Hopi believe we are living in the fourth world. Hopi tradition states the first world was Endless Space, the second was Dark Midnight, the third was the Age of Animals and the fourth is the World Complete. Four migrations were written upon four sacred tablets which man was supposed to undertake once in this fourth world -- to separate into smaller tribes, divided by color, and began to migrate in four different directions, settling in new lands. The Medicine Wheel Prophecy: The Polarity of Institutions vs. Individuals 
""At the beginning of this cycle of time, long ago, the Great Spirit made an appearance and gathered the peoples of this Earth together, and said to the human beings, ""I'm going to send you to four directions, and over time I'm going to change you to four colors, but I'm going to give you some teachings, and you will call these the Original Teachings; when you come back together with each other, you will share these so that you can live and have peace on Earth, and a great civilization will come about"" 
""And so He gave each of us a responsibility, and we call that the Guardianship. To the Indian people, the Red people, He gave the Guardianship of the Earth"" To the South, He gave the yellow race of people Guardianship of the Wind"" To the West, He gave the black race of people Guardianship of the Water"" To the North, He gave the white race of people Guardianship of the Fire"" Each of the four races went to their directions and learned their teachings"" [but] some of the brothers and sisters had forgotten the sacredness of all things, and all the human beings were going to suffer for this"" The elders knew peace would not come on the Earth until the circle of humanity is complete; until all the four colors sat in the circle and shared their teachings -- then peace would come on Earth."" 
~ Source : A Cherokee Legend by Lee Brown, Cherokee 
I have watched with dismay and horror over the last few years especially, and my lifetime in total, as the powers that be, every institution of each type -- religious, government, corporate and media -- have interjected and overwhelmed the discourse of the collective conversation, stifling the development of the discussion and thus the development of our thinking and being. This happens concerning practically every subject -- topics are reduced to a consideration of limited polarities. This reinforces polarity in the human mind, which is trained from birth to look for opposites: Good/Evil, Right/Wrong, Left/Right, Thesis/Antithesis. - Advertisement - 
The very inquiry into the origins of human thinking and being is posed through the duality of polarity, and yet it is most often considered a singular polarity. Why are we the way we are? Is it the result of nature, or nurture? The debate of nature versus nurture is posed in a single distinct polarization, yet the best question itself supersedes the mindset of the singular polarity. Traditionally, the question is viewed philosophically as a trinity of options -- the thesis (nature), antithesis (nurture) and synthesis (both) of one and the other. And yet, in its natural state, this mode of thinking is more comprehensively a matrix of four: thesis, antithesis, synthesis (both) or neither -- the mindset of infinite alternative potential. 
Such comprehensive thinking is uncommon today, as the institutions of the status quo have worked to maintain limited, polarizing collective narratives (particularly through the corporate media) so as to keep control of the way we think, and therefore, behave. But, when we understand how duality and polarity can be used against us, we soon come to see there are many holes in the institutional faรยงade. Sometimes it is their actions that expose them, but quite often it is what they say and how they say it -- or what they don't say -- that provides clarity into their real motivation: domination. Four Types of Institutional Lies 
There are four basic types of institutional/political lies, which directly correlate to the four basic forms of arithmetic. Like all effective lies, each type involves some nugget of truth. The first type of lie is the addition of information: Sometimes the addition of a small bit of (generally false) information can change the story entirely. The second type of lie is the subtraction of information: The removal of small key components can result in entirely different meaning. The third type of lie is the multiplication of information: Exaggerations of situations and related information are included in its presentation, to dilute or emphasize. The fourth type of lie is the division of information: The facts are interlaced with 'disconnects' which separate or underplay the significance of information. 
This approach is often used to cover institutional prejudices and bias; to maintain the appearance of objectivity among institutional leaders. The four main categories of human prejudice are racial, religious, institutional/national and cultural heritage/history. Often prejudice is simply based on the pigment of one's skin, or other inherited features, but sometimes it is much more nuanced and complicated than that, particularly where a history of conflict exists. And while human prejudice is typically based on these four distinctions, the specifics of each are near limitless.",1
The Clean Energy Market Trumps The War On Coal,"(1 fan) - Advertisement - 
""China installed 26 gigawatts (Gw) of renewable electric generation in the last two years,"" said Colleen Regan, Head of North American Environmental Markets and Cross-sector Research, Bloomberg New Energy Finance. She was presenting at Colorado State University's 21 st Century Energy Transition Symposium. 
Afterword, she confirmed that China installed 20 gigawatts of solar photovoltaic (PV) panels in the first 6 months of 2016, dwarfing the 4.3 Gw California installed in all of 2014. 
Regan's information demonstrates how rapidly renewable energy can overtake fossil fuel. Twenty Gw of capacity equals roughly 40, 500 megawatt coal-fired generating stations. It's 8 times more than the 2.5 Gw of generating capacity at Colstrip, Montana's mammoth mine-mouth coal-fired complex. 
To reduce human-caused climate change, Regan forecasts China will meet its 5 year goals of installing 26 Gw of wind and solar generation each year by 2020. By August 2016 China had cut 150 million metric tons of coal capacity, 60 percent of its annual target. 
This demolishes assumptions that increased coal sales to China will prop up bankrupt US coal companies, and dwindling coal tax and royalty revenues in coal producing states. China has moved away from the coal generating frenzy. Its cities have pollution levels 8 times higher than the maximums which trigger alarm in the US. And it can no longer afford to use 20% of its water to cool power plants. Horrible pollution day at the Great Wall License DMCA 
Hence, Chinese coal use dropped 2% in 2014 and 3% in 2015. That helped cause ""1,000 of China's 11,000 coal mines to close,"" according to symposium presenter, Jennifer Turner, Director of the China Environment Forum at the Woodrow Wilson Center. There are ""now 1.3 million unemployed Chinese coal miners,"" she said. Chinese are preoccupied with finding them jobs rather than importing coal to help keep Montana's 1900 coal miners employed. Consequently, rational investors who are cognizant of this reality should be less optimistic about developing coal export terminals on our west coast. 
What about the 1.3 to 1.5 billion people still without electricity? Won't they want to use cheap coal-fire electricity? They would if it were cheaper. But it's not. So they are skipping fossil fuel technology--just like they skipped landline telephones--and are moving to renewable electric generation, much of it coming from distributed micro grids and battery storage. - Advertisement - 
Confirmation that renewables are often cheaper came from Symposium panelist Cathy Woollums, Sr. Vice President, Environmental & Chief Environmental Counsel for Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway Energy. She said, ""MidAmerican Energy received Iowa Utilities Board approval to install 1000, 2 Megawatt Vestas wind turbines"" by 2019. It will ensure that Iowa--which now gets 35% of its electricity from the wind--will be running on 85% clean electrons by 2019, far ahead of Colorado's 30% and Montana's 15%. 
Ms. Woollums said, ""To do the 2 gigawatt project, MidAmerican did not ask to increase electricity rates"" for the 752,000 electric customers in Iowa, Illinois, Nebraska and South Dakota. She also said Mid-America was not planning to build natural gas facilities to integrate the wind into its system. The project--which rivals the capacity of Colstrip's four largest coal-fired facilities--will generate more than $1.2 billion in landowner easement and property tax payments over the next 40 years. 
Thus, Montana and other coal-state businesses will have a tougher time competing in surrounding states whose utilities are incorporating more no-fuel-cost electricity (i.e., renewables) into their electricity generation mix. 
Mid-America has a 100% renewable energy vision. At least 17 US cities have committed to work toward 100% too, including: Fort Collins, Boulder, and Aspen, Colorado; Rochester, Minnesota; Greenberg, Kansas; and San Francisco, San Diego, and Santa Barbara, California. Palo Alto, California, and Burlington, Vermont are already there. 
Xcel Energy will close two Minnesota coal-fired plants by 2026. Xcel will add at least 1 Gw of cost-effective wind turbines by 2019, and 0.65 Gw of community solar gardens or other cost-effective solar installations by 2021. So, as Montana's neighbors install more green electricity, it'll be less able to export dirty electrons unless exports meet green energy requirements. - Advertisement - 
2015 produced $349 billion in clean energy investment. Some believe that's a ""war on coal"" that Trump and some Republicans can stop. Others know they'll just ""make electricity more expensive again.""",1
Trump (finally) Plays Antiwar Card (a little),"License DMCA 
I woke up yesterday (Thursday) to a small but somewhat encouraging snippet on page 19 of my local (German) paper headlined ""Trump: Clinton Risking World War,"" referring to Trump's remarks on Tuesday in a Reuters interview that was headlined ""Trump says Clinton policy on Syria would lead to World War Three."" 
The five-sentence German article ended with this: ""Critics noted that such [no-fly zones as proposed by Clinton] might have to be enforced militarily."" This was apparently (back-translating from the German) a translation of ""Some analysts fear that protecting those zones could bring the United States into direct conflict with Russian fighter jets"" (Reuters). 
The Reuters article goes on to say: ""Clinton's campaign dismissed the criticism, noting that both Republican and Democratic national security experts have denounced Trump as unfit to be commander-in-chief.""""'Once again, he is parroting Putin's talking points and playing to Americans' fears, all while refusing to lay out any plans of his own for defeating ISIS or alleviating humanitarian suffering in Syria,' Clinton spokesman Jesse Lehrich said in a statement."" 
The New York Times and other mainstream outlets reported similarly. I suppose this is considered ""balanced"" coverage -- as if what Lehrich or ""Clinton's campaign"" said was a substantive response to what Trump has finally said clearly and should be obvious. To their credit, the BBC did add (at the end of a 21-sentence article) that Trump ""echoes concerns raised last month at a congressional hearing by the highest-ranking military officer in the US armed forces."" 
""Chairman of the Joint Chiefs Marine Gen. Joseph Dunford told lawmakers a 'no-fly zone' in Syria could spell war with Russia. 'Right now, senator, for us to control all of the airspace in Syria it would require us to go to war, against Syria and Russia,' Gen. Dunford told the Senate Arms Services Committee."" - Advertisement - 
At this point, just days before the election, it is probably too late, but it would be Trump's last opportunity to appear statesmanlike, and also save the planet from the catastrophic military adventurism that Clinton seems bound to embark on if she becomes commander-in-chief. At the least it would be a chance to ratchet up popular protest against the warmongering that has driven virtually all U.S. foreign policy since WWII, and is now taking us (and by ""us"" I mean the world) directly toward the precipice of WWIII. 
""Stop demonizing Russia; work with them, not against them."" This is the message that needs to be shouted from the rooftops, and surely Trump has access to experts like Stephen Cohen, Ray McGovern, Robert Parry and others who can help him do so. He should be able to easily ""trump"" the empty arguments of the bellicose Russia-bashers, even if the latter are aligned across party lines against him -- and against us, since the war they are pushing for will be global. How stupid does one have to be to propose ""no-fly zones"" when the highest military officer in the country says it would result in war with Russia? How stupid does one have to be to believe that Putin is ""Hitler,"" that Russia shot down MH17 and is guilty of ""aggression"" on the eastern European borders, in Ukraine, and in Syria, without ever questioning the ""evidence"" for any of these assertions, much less the equally problematic role the U.S. has played in every case? Yet this is the mainstream narrative, repeated uniformly and relentlessly at every turn. 
Trump is obviously not the best candidate in this race (Jill Stein is), but he is right on this most important issue of relations with Russia, which should have been the No. 1 issue from the beginning. So there is still a slight chance that Trump (and Stein also!) can at least go down with a (non-nuclear!) bang, not a whimper -- by giving peace, and reason, a chance. We should all hope that happens. - Advertisement -",1
China's immoral treatment of Africa must stop,"License DMCA With the U.S. more interested in finding Hillary's emails and measuring Trump's hand size, it's no surprise that Africa, the continent with the fastest economic growth rate in the world, has been painfully absent from this election cycle. With the notable exception of Green VP candidate Ajamu Baraka, virtually no candidate even bothered to second-guess the many covert operations carried out by U.S. military forces in Africa or to examine what Washington's role should be in promoting development in Sub-Saharan Africa. And for better or worse, that void has been rapidly filled by China. In an opinion piece published on October 23, China's newly appointed ambassador to Nigeria emphasized Chinese investors' eagerness to invest into the development of Nigerian infrastructure, manufacturing and agriculture. The ambassador, Zhou Pingjian, also noted the enthusiasm and optimism prevalent among the Chinese business community in Nigeria, stressing the prospect of a lasting and beneficial partnership between the two countries. These developments are just the latest example of China's desire to step up its involvement in Africa. While the relationship has existed since the 1970s, in recent years, China has taken this investment to a new level. At last year's Forum on China-Africa Cooperation (FOCAC), Chinese President Xi Jinping encouraged African leaders to ""open a new era of China-Africa win-win cooperation and common development"" , pledging investments of $60 billion . During a time when Chinese involvement in Africa is rapidly increasing, surveys have shown that the African public holds a generally positive view of China's growing economic role on the continent. Surveys by Afrobarometer revealed that Africans rank China second only to the US as a model for their own country's economic development. In three out of five regions surveyed, China matched or even outpaced the US in terms of popularity as a model for development. In terms of perceived influence, China and the US were second only to former colonial powers. On average, 63 percent viewed China's influence as positive. While these positive attitudes may be linked to the potential positive effects on Africa's economic growth, as analyses from the World Bank suggest, China's involvement with African leaders does not necessarily benefit the local populations. In the past, Beijing has not hesitated to leverage its important role on the continent for its interests using the threat of withdrawal of support to ensure the success of commercial and political objectives. For example, in 2006, China's ambassador to Zambia threatened to cut ties if an opposition candidate who was critical of Chinese investment policies won power. - Advertisement - African leaders regard Chinese money pouring into their country as an appealing alternative to Western funds because in contrast to Western aid, Beijing does not insist on strengthening human rights or the rule of law. Consequently, China has come to forge close relationships with brutal and autocratic African heads of state. China has had longstanding ties with Zimbabwe's Robert Mugabe since funding his guerilla fighters in the 1979 Rhodesian Bush War. When Mugabe took power in 1980, China helped to build a new sports stadium, hospitals, and a power station. Most importantly, China became Mugabe's primary arms supplier. In the decades since, Mugabe and his administration have been accused of a wide range of human rights violations , including repression of activism and civil liberties, and violence leading up to elections, while Mugabe's security forces have even been accused of using torture camps. Last December, President Xi Jinping made it clear that China still shares a bond with Zimbabwe, promising multibillion-dollar investments. While it might be appealing to African politicians, China's willingness to look the other way when it comes to human rights violations has certainly not been good for the people of Zimbabwe. In another example, China's relationship with Egypt's increasingly autocratic President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi has been growing closer . With reduced tourism and support from Europe, Egypt has been turning towards China. For its part, the Chinese government is offering Egypt assistance with multiple infrastructure projects, including transport, housing, and power. China is looking towards Egypt as a focus of its ""One Belt, One Road"" plan to rebuild its ancient maritime Silk Road trade routes connecting China to Europe and Africa. China's business plans frequently serve to prop up dictatorial regimes, and often hold little benefit for the people suffering under them. In Djibouti, profit from foreign military installations rarely improves the lives of Djiboutians, 42 percent of whom continue to live in extreme poverty and 48 percent of whom are unemployed. Meanwhile, China continues to ramp up investment in the nation , investing in multibillion-dollar infrastructure projects such as a new port, two airports, a new railway and other projects. Most importantly, China has started building its first overseas military installation in Djibouti. This support continues despite the fact that Djibouti's strongman President Ismail Omar Guelleh was accused of killing opposition supporters in the run up to the general elections in April, during which he also severely strangled press freedoms . Despite enjoying a positive image among much of Africa's population, China's involvement in Africa often ignores glaring human rights abuses in order to accomplish political and commercial goals. While this might provide much needed funding for infrastructure in the short term, enabling autocratic regimes to act with impunity will be a detriment to Africans in the long run. For Africa to move past the post-colonial authoritarianism of last century, it needs aid that respects Africa's right to self-determination, but also does not tolerate human rights abuses and autocracy. - Advertisement -",1
Hollywood's Big Lies of Omission,"(27 fans) - Advertisement - "" We like nonfiction, and we live in fictitious times. We live in the time where we have fictitious election results that elects a fictitious President. We live in a time where we have a man sending us to war for fictitious reasons. Whether it's the fiction of duct tape or the fictitious orange alerts, we are against this war, Mr. Bush.""--Michael Moore Oscar acceptance speech, moments before his mic was cut off. This year may mark a turning point, where the moral bankruptcy was laid bare for all. I'm speaking of the Bernie Sanders flip-flop for Hillary Clinton, the predictable bait-and-switch, which Democrats never seem to imagine in real time. The rest of us have seen it so often that the ruse has become routine Standard Operating Procedure. A particularly notable case is Sarah Silverman, the filthy-mouthed comedienne, who originally championed Bernie. But she quickly fell into lockstep for Hillary. Silverman had a soul empty enough to go and scold the United States to support a candidate whom she had just been fighting against , and who actually stole the nomination from her own candidate through back-room deals at the DNC and through apparent voting-machine hacking . The thief was rewarded instead of jailed for some reason, which Hollywood has had absolutely zero interest in, as if it didn't happen. They moved on instantly to lambast us all about Donald Trump 24/7. Orwell couldn't have written it better. Hollywood has a highly complex understanding of political philosophy and particularly of this presidential race: 1. Trump Bad 2. Hillary Woman 3. So-called ""Lesser Evil"" We should acknowledge, those who are literate, that Hillary Clinton's repeated threats to escalate World War 3 over Syria leave her as potentially the greater evil, not the lesser at all. The jury is very much out. "" Goldwater Girl"" Hillary Rodham Clinton has a lengthy record of supporting every US aggressive war and opposing none. She may have played a part in the killings of over 2 million human beings so far, merely tallying those casualties from the three countries of Iraq, Syria and Libya. One may opt to also add another half-million Iraqi children who died as a result of her husband's eight years of sanctions. - Advertisement - I noticed Hollywood's widespread mindless support for Democrats back in 2000, when I kicked that shockingly corrupt party to the curb and joyfully cast a vote for Ralph Nader, an actual American hero whose efforts have saved lives. Die-hard whiners of the Democratic rank-and-file still falsely claim that big bad Ralph gave the election to Dubya Bush, when anyone with the ability to read can see that it was the Supreme Court which stopped the legitimate counting of Florida ballots. Add Bush's brother Jeb purging nearly two-hundred thousand minority voters from rolls. But the mindless strategy of attacking third parties and attempting to delegitimize democracy itself persists among the ignorant (a majority of Democrats perhaps). This is by design; this is who they are. They do not believe in democracy, because the billionaires who fund them do not believe in any democracy they cannot control. George W. Bush's theft of the presidency did help expose the moral bankruptcy of Democrats as well as Republicans. When Bush lied about Iraq, Hillary Clinton was right there with him embellishing and freestyling! She claimed Iraq's non-existent ""weapons of mass destruction"" to be ""undisputed."" Her lies helped sell the war to Congress, a war of aggression: what the Nazis did and were hung for at Nuremberg. Her role in aggressive war and in destroying International Law as a restraint against belligerence are profound crimes, grievous war crimes: ""the supreme international crime"" in the words of U.S. Judge Robert Jackson. When a handful of Democrats attempted to impeach the Bush junta for crimes relating to those wars, as well as to torture and cover-up, it was Democrat Nancy Pelosi who announced ""Impeachment is off the table."" Criminal collusion, allowing the crimes to stand without recourse, that is what they did. The US federal government has served as a protection racket for international war crimes. The damage that Democrats inflicted upon the rule of law is equal to that of the Republicans. The former had a moral and legal responsibility to defend the Constitution, their oaths of office, but voluntarily opted not to. The Internet helped flood the world with information to pass around, both good and bad, but the crimes of both parties became difficult for them to wash away now that Google made all web searchers equal. Today, things have accelerated into realms of the absurd. CNN recently cut off a congressman in mid-sentence for uttering the word ""Wikileaks."" This Soviet-style clampdown on dissent remains a shocker even in a society that's pretty much seen it all. - Advertisement - The media, distrusted by most , is only one aspect of the problem though. Americans get their views from joking heads as much as from stodgy teleprompter readers. Talk shows and comedy skits propagandize viewers every bit as much as do the Washington Post or New York Times . Celebrity endorsements matter. A casual glance at those programs would reveal that democracy is non-existent in Hollywood today. All voices are not represented. Minority candidates cannot get air time, will not be interviewed, and will only be mocked in absentia as per John Oliver's recent disgraceful hit piece on Green Party candidate Jill Stein , a cowardly move John. Shameful. But Oliver is far from alone. I single him out because he knows better and could have done justice to the Green Party and to its clear alternative to perpetual war, empire, and industrialized ecocide. But where would that have left him personally vis a vis the Hollywood political consensus?",1
Paul Ryan: He's the Fiscal Policy Illiterate in the Conggress,"License DMCA Ryan, Obama, McConnell, Reid, Pelosi, MSM, and most of Americans need to grasp and act on the irrefutable fact that America can never, involuntarily, go broke. We can afford anything we need which serves a public purpose. All of our needs are paid for from the Treasury's General Fund Account, not from tax dollars or revenue from bond sales. Because Speaker Ryan and his allies, wrongly, couch discussions of spending in the context of scarce resources, the public is always led to believe that Congress must rob Peter to pay Paul, raise taxes, or sell Treasury bonds to fund federal government expenditures. They insist there is only and always the harbinger of debt being the singularly most constraining factor preventing our government from funding public purpose. Nothing is further from reality and the irrefutable truth than this cynical presentation of America's capacity to fund itself. There needs to be an open discussion concerning fiscal policy constraints on Congress allegedly preventing it from appropriating funds to resolve health care provision not only in South Carolina but the provision of funding health care nationally. Clearly, one constraint is ideology (politics.) It would seem that a reasonable political solution would begin with the acknowledgment that doing nothing exacerbates human suffering. No one should support that alternative. A second alternative is to agree to do something that optimizes available resources to resolve the problem of poverty. That solution begins with the acknowledgment of the indisputable power of the Congress to make laws that create the currency with which all Federal Programs are funded. - Advertisement - Because our Federal Government is monetarily sovereign, it can never, involuntarily, ""become bankrupt."" We can never be Greece, or any of the EC member nations because they do not have monetary sovereignty, cannot issue currency. Our Federal Government (Congress, Treasury, and Federal Reserve) issues a sovereign currency, the dollar, as a non-convertible, fiat currency, in a flexible exchange rate regime, and it has no debt in a foreign currency. Under these, irrefutable, monetary characteristics Congressional appropriations are constrained only by the actuality of inflation and Congress' refusal to pay our bills (appropriate funding.) Moreover, Congress never needs revenue per se to fund its appropriations. The notion that our government needs income to spend is, categorically, false in our post gold standard Modern Money Era which began in 1971-'73. Speaker Ryan and company would have us believe that tax revenue is needed to accomplish spending. That contention is illogical. Tax policy in America manages inflation by taking dollars out of the economy to prevent over spending. While there has been no serious threat of inflation since the 1970's, we are over-taxed. Tax policy is also supposed to be designed to manage income distribution. It has failed this task over the past 45 years as marginal tax rates have become more regressive favoring the rich over the rest. Simply put, tax revenue does not fund the Federal Government. That revenue is never recycled. The government simply issues more electronic dollars. It's illogical and inefficient to recycle government liabilities. - Advertisement - The dollars with which we pay the tax liability must first come from government spending. Speaker Ryan knows this and that Government spending is the first source of dollars entering the economy. Fiat creates dollars. In the instance of the Federal Government, when it spends more than it receives in revenue (which it never needs and this construction is purely accounting not a financial requirement.) Ryan and too many others, consider this an economic Armageddon. None of them admit to the existence of the surplus. That surplus, from government ""deficit spending dollars"" is now held by those of us in the private sector. We now possess the dollars; it's our surplus or technically our net financial savings after taxes are paid. It's essentially interest-free money for us to spend as we choose. That's why the financial sector/commercial bankers hate deficit spending. Americans benefit from deficit spending and therefore, don't need to go into debt to maintain living standards. Our surplus from deficit spending is what keeps the economy growing. Federal (public) deficit spending is equal, to the penny, to net financial assets in the private sector. When Ryan and company tell us they're going to cut the deficit, it automatically means they are going to reduce the amount of interest-free money available to us. That eventually will, in short order, force us to use our savings, retained earnings or borrow from banks at interest just to maintain current spending. The last six times our economy went into recession were each preceded by either a government surplus or a balanced budget. In all cases too much was cut or taxed away from us by austerity policies and conversely, not enough government spending was authorized by Congress to support interest-free stimulus. Moreover, since this economy has high levels of regional and sub-regional unemployment (ranging from 12% to 35%), the Federal Government should deficit spend until we have a full employment economy.",1
"Part 6, Democratic Network Money: Commons Money that Works for Us, Instead of Us Working for It","License DMCA "" If we regard money as a thing, it becomes a given, and we lose our ability to change it in any way. . . . When we understand that money is created by a set of understandings and practices, we can begin examining the terms of these agreements to see whether they actually serve our collective aspirations and objectives. Currencies can be redesigned to better meet our needs."" Bernard Lietaer In the first article of this series, following Lietaer, we defined money for what it is; an agreement within a community to use something as a medium of exchange. We noted that money is not stuff in the normal sense. Instead, it is numbers in a system of accounting. Sometimes something physical is used to represent the numbers in this accounting system, but it is just that, a symbol, not the money itself. Our current money has no physical representation. We then discussed how money works in its simplest form; a mutual accounting system. We noted that money involves commitments and claims on commitment. Commitments relate to debits, and claims on commitment relate to credits in the accounting system. In this analysis we intentionally did not use the commonly recited functions of money; medium of exchange, unit of account, store of value, and standard of deferred payment. The reason is that the latter two functions replace and obscure the fact that money is the measure of commitment and claims on commitment, which underlie store and standard. In the second article , we discussed the social implications of money, and the concept of capital. We introduced the rights/responsibility equation; how in a democracy, with every right there is a corresponding responsibility, commitments and claims on commitment being an example of the more general concept. We went on to define money capital;money capital is a large claim on commitment, and it relies on the commitment of its users to get this claim; again an example of fact that for every credit, there is a corresponding debit, following the rights/responsibility equation. In the third article , we described our present private-for-profit money system, and noted that in the present system, the rights/responsibility equation is ignored. Money is created by fiat, without acknowledging that the money created represents a commitment on the part of all of its users to the operation and stability of the money issue. The fact that this commitment is not acknowledged gives the managers of the money system great power over its users. They decide what money is to be created for, and what actions it will support. Money is created for its creator's profit. In support of this argument, we disaggregated profit, demonstrating its two functions; providing compensation for time and effort exerted, and an unearned portion that is a private tax on the market. This private tax goes to the owners of the banking system and for profit businesses. - Advertisement - In the fourth article , we discussed alternatives that are currently being considered. We found that Central Government created fiat money has many of the characteristics of private-for-profit money. It is a top down, authority managed form of money that again ignores the commitment of its users to its operation and stability. A second weakness is that it leaves in place the private-for-profit banks as the interface between the users of the money and its creators. Thus the issue of the unearned private tax on its users is not properly dealt with. It is noted that historically, government created money has, over time been corrupted and taken over by the bankers, because of this weakness. In the fifth article we discussed natural and human capital. We noted that natural capital was here before humans came on the scene, and that it was treated as a commons by early man. We noted that the concept of private ownership depends on violence and power, not democratic decision making; that those who promoted private property promoted it to gain power, not to promote democracy. We pointed out that the drive for profit as the primary directive of the present money system is a major motivation for militarism, bullying, and the promotion of fear and anger. This contrasts with the values underlying simple money; to value its users and manage their mutual provisioning. The work of Henry George and Elinor Ostrom was shown to support the concepts of simple money. In this final article of the series we discuss a method for moving from our present money system to the use of simple money. Following the edict that we don't concentrate on what is wrong, but on creating something that serves those of us who use it, and exhibits values that are consistent with what we need and want, we create a new system, and let the old one go its own way, as it doesn't serve our use. - Advertisement - Unlike government issued money, simple money requires no legislation for its introduction; it can be introduced by its users. It will initially not be coin of the realm; useful in payment of taxes, but it will be useful to its users, and will demonstrate this usefulness to them, and those they deal with. Acceptance can be gradual, as approval is gained. It can support alternative businesses and institutions in their development and operation. In time, simple money can be acknowledged as official coin in local jurisdictions, and then larger ones. Open source blockchain accounting systems are the natural form for mutual money to be organized with our present technology. However in setting up democratic blockchain platforms, it is important that all the values built into the simple democratic system are implemented. It is important that systems be limited to a community scale, and that users know who each other are, so trust can be informally as well as formally supported. Structures need to be put into place so that users set limits on positive and negative balances, to prevent abuse. Crowd funding can be structurally facilitated, as well as community funding. Instead of 'mining' for money, money would be created as a commitment to other members of the community. Balances will revolve around zero instead of always being positive to maintain the zero sum game. With these provisions, the money supply is automatically regulated.",1

The Israeli Trumpess,"WHAT WILL Donald Trump do if he loses the elections in a week and a half from now, as most polls indicate? 
He has already declared that he will recognize the results -- but only if he wins. 
That sounds like a joke. But it is far from being a joke. 
Trump has already announced that the election is rigged. The dead are voting (and all the dead vote for Hillary Clinton). The polling station committees are corrupt. The polling machines forge the results. 
No, that is not a joke. Not at all. - Advertisement - 
THIS IS not a joke, because Trump represents tens of millions of Americans, who belong to the lower strata of the white population, which the white elite used to call ""white trash."" In more polite language they are called ""blue collar workers,"" meaning manual workers, unlike the ""white collar workers"" who occupy the offices. 
If the tens of millions of blue collar voters refuse to recognize the election results, American democracy will be in danger. The United States may become a banana republic, like some of its southern neighbors, which have never enjoyed a stable democracy. 
This problem exists in all modern nation-states with a sizable national minority. The lowest strata of the ruling people hates the minority. Members of the minority push them out of the lower jobs. And more importantly: the lower strata of the ruling majority have nothing to be proud of except for their belonging to the ruling people.

My generation grew up in admiration of American democracy. We saw European democracy breaking down and sinking into the morass of fascism. We admired this young America, which saved Europe in two world wars, out of sheer idealism. The democratic America vanquished German Nazism and Japanese militarism, and later Soviet Bolshevism. 
Our childish attitude gave way to a more mature view. We learned about the genocide of the native Americans and about slavery. We saw how America is seized from time to time by an attack of craziness, such as the witch hunt of Salem and the era of Joe McCarthy, who discovered a Communist under every bed. 
But we also saw Martin Luther King, we saw the first black President, and now we are probably about to see the first female President. All because of this miracle: American democracy.",1
The Failure of Democracy -- How The Oligarchs Plan To Steal The Election,"License DMCA 
I am now convinced that the Oligarchy that rules America intends to steal the presidential election. In the past, the oligarchs have not cared which candidate won as the oligarchs owned both. But they do not own Trump. 
Most likely you are unaware of what Trump is telling people as the media does not report it. A person who speaks like this is not endeared to the oligarchs. 
Who are the oligarchs? -- Wall Street and the mega-banks too big to fail and their agent the Federal Reserve, a federal agency that put five banks ahead of millions of troubled American homeowners who the federal reserve allowed to be flushed down the toilet. In order to save the mega-banks' balance sheets from their irresponsible behavior, the Fed has denied retirees any interest income on their savings for eight years, forcing the elderly to draw down their savings, leaving their heirs, who have been displaced from employment by corporate jobs offshoring, penniless.
-- The military/security complex which has spent trillions of our taxpayer dollars on 15 years of gratuitous wars based entirely on lies in order to enrich themselves and their power. 
-- The neoconservatives whose crazed ideology of US world hegemony thrusts the American people into military conflict with Russia and China. - Advertisement - 
-- The US global corporations that sent American jobs to China and India and elsewhere in order to enrich the One Percent with higher profits from lower labor costs. 
-- Agribusiness (Monsanto et.al.), corporations that poison the soil, the water, the oceans, and our food with their GMOs, hebicides, pesticides, and chemical fertilizers, while killing the bees that pollinate the crops. 
-- The extractive industries -- energy, mining, fracking, and timber -- that maximize their profits by destroying the environment and the water supply. 
-- The Israel Lobby that controls US Middle East policy and is committing genocide against the Palestinians just as the US committed genocide against native Americans. Israel is using the US to eliminate sovereign countries that stand in Israel's way.

I am yet to see one Hillary yard sign, but Trump signs are everywhere. Reports I receive are that Hillary's public appearances are unattended but Trump's are so heavily attended that people have to be turned away. This is a report from a woman in Florida: 
""Trump has pulled huge numbers all over FL while campaigning here this week. I only see Trump signs and stickers in my wide travels. I dined at a Mexican restaurant last night. Two women my age sitting behind me were talking about how they had tried to see Trump when he came to Tallahassee. They left work early, arriving at the venue at 4:00 for a 6:00 rally. The place was already over capacity so they were turned away. It turned out that there were so many people there by 2:00 that the doors had to be opened to them. The women said that the crowds present were a mix of races and ages."" 
I know the person who gave me this report and have no doubt whatsoever as to its veracity.",1
Customizing Truth,"License DMCA Part I -- Liars For those who might wonder why foreign policy makers repeatedly make bad choices, some insight might be drawn from the following analysis. The action here plays out in the United States, but the lessons are probably universal. Back in the early spring of 2003, George W. Bush initiated the invasion of Iraq. His public reason for doing so was the belief that the country's dictator, Saddam Hussein, was on the verge of developing nuclear weapons. The real reason went beyond that charge and included a long-range plan for ""regime change"" in the Middle East. For our purposes we will concentrate on the belief that Iraq was about to become a hostile nuclear power. Why did President Bush and his close associates accept this scenario so readily? The short answer is Bush wanted, indeed needed, to believe it as a rationale for invading Iraq. At first he had tried to connect Saddam Hussein to the 11 September 2001 attacks on the U.S. Though he never gave up on that stratagem, the lack of evidence made it difficult to rally an American people, already fixated on Afghanistan, to support a war against Baghdad. However, the nuclear weapons gambit proved more fruitful, not because there was any hard evidence for the charge, but because supposedly reliable witnesses, in the persons of exiled anti-Saddam Iraqis, kept telling Bush and his advisers that the nuclear story was true. What we had was a U.S. leadership cadre whose worldview literally demanded a mortally dangerous Iraq, and informants who, in order to precipitate the overthrow of Saddam, were willing to tell the tale of pending atomic weapons. The strong desire to believe the tale of a nuclear Iraq lowered the threshold for proof. Likewise, the repeated assertions by assumed dependable Iraqi sources underpinned a nationwide U.S. campaign generating both fear and war-fever. - Advertisement - So the U.S. and its allies insisted that the United Nations send in weapons inspectors to scour Iraq for evidence of a nuclear weapons program. That the inspectors could find no convincing evidence only frustrated the Bush administration and soon forced its hand. On 19 March 2003 Bush launched the invasion of Iraq. The expectation was that, once in occupation of the country, they would surely find those nukes. They did not. Their Iraqi informants had systematically lied to them. Part II -- Social and Behavioral Sciences to the Rescue? The various U.S. intelligence agencies were thoroughly shaken by this affair, and today, 13 years later, their directors and managers are still trying to sort it out -- specifically, how to tell when they are getting ""true"" intelligence and when they are being lied to. Or, as one intelligence worker has put it, we need ""help to protect us against armies of snake oil salesmen."" To that end the CIA et al., are in the market for academic assistance. A ""partnership"" is being forged between the Office of the Director of National Intelligence (ODNI), which serves as the coordinating center for the 16 independent U.S. intelligence agencies, and the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering and Medicine. The result of this collaboration will be a ""permanent Intelligence Community Studies Board"" to coordinate programs in ""social and behavioral science research [that] might strengthen national security."" Despite this effort, it is almost certain that the ""social and behavioral sciences"" cannot give the spy agencies what they want -- a way of detecting lies that is better than their present standard procedures of polygraph tests and interrogations. But even if they could, it might well make no difference, because the real problem is not to be found with the liars. It is to be found with the believers. - Advertisement - Part III -- Believers It is simply not true, as the ODNI leaders seem to assert, that U.S. intelligence agency personnel cannot tell, more often than not, that they are being lied to. This is the case because there are thousands of middle-echelon intelligence workers, desk officers, and specialists who know something closely approaching the truth -- that is, they know pretty well what is going on in places like Afghanistan, Iraq, Syria, Libya, Israel, Palestine and elsewhere. Therefore, if someone feeds them ""snake oil"" they usually know it. However, having an accurate grasp of things is often to no avail because their superiors -- those who got their appointments by accepting a pre-structured worldview -- have different criterion for what is ""true"" than do the analysts. 
Listen to Charles Gaukel, of the National Intelligence Council -- yet another organization that acts as a meeting ground for the 16 intelligence agencies. Referring to the the search for a way to avoid getting taken in by lies, Mr. Gaukel has declared, ""We're looking for truth. But we're particularly looking for truth that works."" Now what might that mean? I can certainly tell you what it means historically. It means that for the power brokers, ""truth"" must match up, fit with, their worldview -- their political and ideological precepts. If it does not fit, it does not ""work."" So the intelligence specialists who send their usually accurate assessments up the line to the policy makers often hit a roadblock caused by group-think, ideological blinkers, and a ""we know better"" attitude.",1
Only Making Matters Worse in Syria,"License DMCA 
Middle East policy has reached an inflexion point, a moment when Official Washington seems to be caught in the middle between escalation and retreat. 
On one hand, the rhetoric has not been more militant since Hillary Clinton's famous ""we came, we saw, he died"" moment in October 2011. With Barack Obama halfway out the door and Clinton all but crowned, Washington's laptop bombardiers are rejoicing that the half-measures are over and judgment day nearly at hand. 
Thus, The New York Times assures us that that the Middle East is ""desperate for American leadership"" while the Washington Post reports that ""the Republicans and Democrats who make up the foreign policy elite are laying the ground work for a more assertive American foreign policy."" 
Leading think tanks are publishing ""a flurry of reports"" urging stepped-up intervention, including U.S.-backed ""safe zones to protect moderate rebels from Syrian and Russian forces"" and even ""limited"" cruise-missile strikes.

But reading between the lines, a very different picture emerges, a realization that the U.S. has painted itself into a corner and that there is little it can do after all. Thus, the Times observes that while the Middle East is clamoring for U.S. leadership, it is not clamoring for Bush-style intervention but for some mythical ""middle ground"" in between him and Obama. 
While reporting that pro-escalation sentiment is unanimous in Washington's vast foreign-policy establishment -- sometimes known as "" the blob "" -- the Washington Post notes that ""even pinprick cruise-missile strikes designed to hobble the Syrian air force or punish [President Bashar al-]Assad would risk a direct confrontation with Russian forces"" and wonders whether a war-weary public will support any intervention at all. 
""My concern is that we may be talking to each other and agreeing with each other,"" it quotes one expert as saying, ""but that these discussions are isolated from where the public may be right now."" 
Official Washington in a Bubble 
Thus, even the Establishment worries that it lives in a bubble. Washington wants war, it needs war, and yet it admits in practically the same breath that it can't have it. So what will it do? - Advertisement - 
Then there are the mild liberals over at Vox, the hip and successful Washington website founded by journalistic wunderkind Ezra Klein. Voxers pride themselves on being sharp and practical yet in the end they are sealed off as well. The poster boy for this tendency is Zack Beauchamp, a young writer who stars in a recent Vox video entitled, "" The crisis in Aleppo, explained in 4 minutes ."" 
As Beauchamp lectures away amid fancy graphics and cool background music, the video faithfully toes the Washington line, both the stirring gung-ho part and the downbeat refrain that inevitably follows. Thus, he describes the Syrian civil war as a ""story of flip-flops,"" with Assad seemingly on the ropes until Iran and Russia put him back on his feet, at which point the Saudis and Qataris put the rebels back on their feet so the game can continue. 
But the real turning point, he says, occurred in September 2015 when Russia stepped in with airstrikes that allowed the government to besiege the Salafists in eastern Aleppo. 
""A siege,"" Beauchamp then explains, ""involves trapping a group of people, civilians and fighters both, inside a certain territory and denying them supplies until they can no longer fight. Assad's strategy has a vicious logic to it. When you deprive people of food and you bomb them over and over again, they're likely to give in just to make the fighting stop.""",1
"Continuing Email Flap Won't Derail Clinton, But There's Still Danger","Headlined to H3 10/28/16 - Advertisement - 
GOP presidential contender Donald Trump giddily and predictably wasted no time when FBI Director James Comey announced that the agency was looking at more Clinton emails. For the umpteenth time, Trump branded her a criminal and demanded that Americans not let her ""criminal enterprise"" into the Oval Office. No matter that Comey made it clear that there is no evidence at the moment that there was anything improper, let alone illegal, in the emails. But the revelation that the Feds were looking at them coming in the stretch run to the White House was more than enough to set off talk of the perennially mentioned October surprise that could derail a presidential candidate's presidential bid; in this case the candidate being Clinton. 
Even if there is something amiss in the emails, it won't change the race's outcome. Trump's path to an electoral vote win was always dicey at best, but more likely, impossible. The big electoral states such as California, New York, Illinois, Maryland, Washington, and a handful of other less electoral rich states are solid lock down Democratic states. The six or seven key swing states that are crucial, either trend Democratic. In nearly all cases, they voted for President Obama in his election and re-election bids, and are almost certain to stay that way through Election Day. 
Having said that, the email flap just won't go away. This does pose something else that could be problematic for Clinton in the White House. That's turning the GOP into an even more ferocious, obstructionist, take-no-prisoners party that will wage open war against her administration. Trump and the GOP have hammered home the line that Clinton is shady, untrustworthy and, less charitably, a serial liar. It's had an effect. Her approval and popularity ratings have hovered just slightly above those of Trump. In some pithy polls, voters vote ""neither"" for and not for either her or Trump. The race to the bottom in the presidential campaign has been fed by the near fetish focus by much of the mainstream media and far too many pundits on the sex and corruption allegations against respectively Trump and Clinton. 
The FBI's announcement of more email probes means that Clinton will have to take precious time out from her campaign focus on the issues that should and do really matter to again answer questions about what she did and why she did it with her emails. Reporters will shout this at her no matter what point she's trying to make about jobs, health care, or a foreign policy matter. 
Once in the Oval office, this fetish isn't likely to end, Trump and the GOP will see to that. The opening salvo came from Arizona Senator John McCain when he saber rattled Clinton by calling for the rejection of any Clinton SCOTUS pick. Even if the Democrats take back the Senate, that threat is still not just hot air. The GOP will still have enough Senate votes to delay, foot drag, obstruct, harass, pick and probe endlessly at, and ultimately filibuster a Clinton pick. The hope being that this will force Clinton to withdraw the pick, and send the message that the choice for the High Court must pass the hard-nosed conservative ideological litmus test that's the GOP set piece for a SCOTUS judge. 
The warfare will be even worse in the House which the GOP almost certainly will control. House Speaker Paul Ryan gave a huge signal just how fierce that warfare against her will be. He was barely a step behind Trump in climbing all over the Comey announcement about the emails to lambaste Clinton. - Advertisement - 
If Clinton moves quickly as she's promised with her plan to ramp up spending on jobs and economic reconstruction to the tune of $300 billion, this will send the GOP scurrying even faster to the barricades. It will try and toss every barrier it can in her way, making all kinds of wild charges that the spending is nothing more than a pork barrel, gravy leaden, pay out to the urban poor, and disadvantaged, at the expense of the long suffering, high tax paying white middle-class. 
Clinton takes office with the GOP manufactured and Trump fed cloud of suspicion hanging heavily over her. The great danger is that this will plant the seed even deeper in the public that the Clintons are the personification of sleaze. This in turn would blur, ignore and flat out dodge any real talk about tax reform job growth and the economy, health care, wealth and income inequality, civil rights, environmental concerns and criminal justice reforms. 
Clinton's continuing email problems can't make Trump into what he isn't and never was. And that's a credible, qualified choice to occupy the Oval Office. It just makes it that much easier for the GOP to do even more to make it harder for Clinton who is that choice to do the job that she will be elected to do.

Thank You FBI! You Helped To Make President Clinton,"- Advertisement - What the heck was FBI Director James Comey thinking? Three emails found with the name ""Clinton"" in them on disgraced, serial genitals photographer, Anthony Weiner's computer, amounts to an investigation tantamount to and obliquely suggestive of criminal behavior. Not satisfied to insert himself and the FBI into the political maelstrom of the 2106 presidential campaign, FBI Director, James B. Comey, a lifelong Republican, has now made himself and the agency a complete laughing stock in its dealings with Hillary Rodham Clinton. He should do the right thing and resign over this monumental fumble that reeks of political Republican bias. I find it very hard to see just how he's going to continue effectively running the FBI when he's done so much to undermine its legendary independency and penchant for secrecy that has made it one of the most feared and respected law enforcement agencies in the world. Now Comey's action has rendered this proud and efficient agency as a dopey version of the Keystone Kops. A kind of Uncle Gadget-like approach to anything Clinton perhaps a reaction by political osmosis contaminated by his brethren in the Congress. The unprecedented FBI press conference before his congressional hearing led by his witch-hunting party, turned out to be an expensive joke as the so-called secret information gleaned from a private email server in Hillary Clinton's basement could only yield a few lines of ""confidential"" classification. This forced Comey and his angry Republican kin in Congress to express outrage that he did not have HRC charged, well, for ""something."" Never mind the EVIDENCE of deliberate criminal action was a scarce as a Dodo bird. Comey, perhaps smarting at the stinging rebuke from his cohorts in Congress who thought that he was letting her off the hook or that he was ""a sell out,"" might have wanted to get back in their good books by sending a letter so immature and, well, stupid, as to draw peals of uncontrolled fits of laughter if this was not the end of a unique presidential election. It is serious when the head of the FBI writes Congress and hints of something nefarious. Eleven days out and Comey springs his ""October Surprise"" perhaps trying to send a subtle dog whistle to Republican voters that HRC ""might, perhaps, could be"" dragged up on unnamed and unspecified criminal charged so, by default, vote for Donald Trump. How else is this to be interpreted? The timing, the vagueness, ""draw your own conclusioness"" of the letter, and the careful use of language that was not definitive or direct but with enough spin to suggest that there MIGHT BE SOMETHING AMISS THERE -- at last! But the Comey revelation and clumsy letter writing immediately backfired when it was revealed that the computer was NOT HRC's own, and had all to do with the silly little twit named one Anthony Weiner, whose penchant for making himself an utter ass is without parallel. Poor HRC had NOTHING to do with this. Almost immediately the Republican amen chorus that was singing the demise of HRC and the praises of the Orange-haired One, gulped air like a fish stranded on dry land. The self-righteous, chest thumping, and the gleeful orgasmic teetering that welcomed this new HRC ""email revelation"" and fumble ended as immediately as it started. Nah, that was definitely not the political manna from heaven that these bozos were desperately praying for. That and a bolt of God-fearing, Bible-brimstone-and-fire lightening to strike the Demon HRC! - Advertisement - Within two hours the semi-hard doo-doo struck the proverbial fan scattering its stench on the faces of Comey, Trump, Paul Ryan and all of the mainstream media pundits and anchors who rushed so quickly to judgment and pulled out their lariats to hang HRC from the nearest tree. With stinky egg on their goofy faces and sheepish grins all around, HRC marched (the Rasta men would say ""trod"") to the microphones and demanded that Comey and the Keystone Kops release the emails. Show and tell the American people she demanded -- ladylike. That's called ""calling your bluff."" And, by crickey! She's an old hand at that! Again she demonstrated and proved --once more (how many times does she have to freakin' prove it?) that she is as fit as a fiddle to be president of the United States. The bunch of childish, clownish clumsy boys that she's had to fend off all of her life looked sullen and morose. Chest-fallen -- I like that word! I could hear them crying: Bummer! We sure thought that we had her this time! And just as immediately the calls came for Comey to explain and resign. He's the fall guy, the patsy, the one who wrote the letter. Serves him right! The feisty, petite dynamo showed just how big her cajones are and just how tough she is by COMPLETELY IGNORING Donald Trump's Twitter tantrums, Paul Ryan's hot-and-cold silliness, Mitch McConnell's growing senility, and the rest of the GOP's sorry-brigade pouting and mammy bellowing and wailing. What a gal! She does not have to yell, scream, and get the FBI director to do something foolish to win this election. Madame, you have withstood this unnecessary, unfair, unjust, unprincipled and undemocratic attacks, targeted maligning and political obsession with you and then some. If you were a man subjected to the same level of attacks you would have certainly cracked already. You make these guys look as so many wimps and wusses. But you're made of sterner stuff. We who have watched and followed your stellar and outstanding career know that only too well. Comey by his really, really poor lack of judgment and bad political calculations has just strengthened your position. The thing backfired and has now blown up in their collective faces. You should laugh out loud -- but not now. Wait until November 8 and then have a big, hearty Hillary Clinton laugh from you feet on up. For now it's the home stretch and you're almost there. - Advertisement -",1
"The Shame, The Heartbreak- Another Day In America","- Advertisement - 
Here's the thing:Today, October 27, 2016, I, like many of you, watched live feeds of the events going down at Standing Rock.I am at a loss to define my feelings. Anger, outrage, pity, fear 
...One phrase kept going through my mind, like a mantra- This is not my America. This is not my America. This is not my America. protests at DAPL License DMCA 
And then in counter-point was the thought- But it is. But it is. But it is.Over one hundred heavily armed cops in riot gear, supported by military assault vehicles and helicopters forced peaceful, prayerful water protectors from their own land, ceded to them in the Treaty of 1851. The police are nothing more than a mercenary army protecting the interests of the owners of the DAPL. There was the wail of sound cannons aimed at the protectors, there was tear gas. There were rubber bullets being fired into the crowd.And in my mind- This is not my America (But it is) This is not my America (But it is) This is not my America (But it is) This is about water. There's no political ideology here. We cannot live without water. Decisions are being made that effect the future, and the lives of our children and our grandchildren.This effects all of us. It's not just happening ""out there"" in the Dakotas or in Iowa or in Texas or in New Mexico. It's everywhere. For god sake, there are already over 2.5 million miles pipeline already installed in the continental United States. Just the other day, mere miles from where I live a Sunoco pipeline leaked over 55,000 gallons of gasoline into the Susquehanna River, endangering the water for over 6 million people down river. Where I live, in northeastern Pennsylvania, there are fracking wells all over the place. And an average of 2.8 million of gallons of clean water were filled with known poisons and toxins and pumped under pressure into the aquifer beneath my feet. There are places within miles of where I live that people can set fire to their water.It's too late for anyone to avoid the destruction, here where I live. We have to deal with the aftermath. The after the fact poisoning of our water and the inevitable leaks and the illnesses and the pockets of strange cancers. This is a shameful day, for all of us. I am sick, in heart, mind and spirit, but I have hope.The battle hasn't even started. Now is when decisions must be made. Hard decisions that will impact on our own sense of comfort and will demand that we risk that comfort, or lose the future. To do nothing is to accept that our children,and our grandchildren will have no clean water to drink, no clean air to breathe, no clean land to live on.This is not overstating the things. It is not alarmist. It is the simplest of truths. - Advertisement -",1

This is really sickening footage from North Dakota, but you need to watch it now and share it widely with your friends and groups, please. 
Shame, shame....I truly feel shame for my nation of oppressors, and shame turns to anger. 
Little or none of this is appearing on any mainstream media, just a video on the UN Rights of Indigenous Peoples which 3+ millions have watched. 
What you will see in this video is what is really going on, the true front line. They are heavily armed, using pepper spray in aggressive ways that it is not supposed to be used, using tasers and violence. (image by Unicorn RIot TV) License DMCA - Advertisement - 
I hope millions internationally see how North Dakota and the corporations are treating the people whose only crime was that they were here first. 
I don't know what the solution really is, other than Obama ordering a complete cessation of the pipeline construction. Bernie Sanders has made clear that he supports the native defenders and wants to put a stop to the Dakota Access Pipeline. He is only one Senator: ask yours to help soon! 
This is turning from an outrage to a massive sense of shame for what our nation is becoming. - Advertisement -",1
GOP has a day of reckoning coming,"License DMCA The face of the Republican Party. 
There is a light at the end of this tunnel called a presidential election campaign and, if the gods are not playing a cruel trick on us, that light is not on an engine with TRUMP emblazoned on its sides. In any event, the end is near and I am as weary of writing about this ugly affair probably as you are of reading about it. 
The problem is, that's all most of the mainstream and social media care to talk about these days. In case you missed the other news: 1) The Cubs and Indians are in the World Series. 2) Heavily armed police in North Dakota attacked hundreds of protesters who joined the Standing Rock Sioux tribe trying to block construction of a pipeline they say threatens water supplies and sacred sites. 3) Soupy Sales, master of the pie-in-the-face, died. And 4) Tim Tebow is apparently just as good at baseball as he was at playing quarterback in the NFL. 
But really, the only thing the media want to talk about are Donald Trump's repeated claims that the election is rigged and that the press -- meaning all the news outlets who report accurately on his words and actions -- lie. 
These are claims that losers and demagogues resort to when everything else -- lies, threats, lies, threats, lies, threats -- fails. Honestly, it is disheartening to feel a need to point out to, apparently, millions of Americans, that Trump's claims are nonsense. It is even more disheartening to realize that many of the people who still support his candidacy don't seem to care. There is a major issue to address some day soon in that. 
Meanwhile, as to his two claims: Voter fraud is virtually non-existent in America. You can check this with any legitimate news provider. The real threat is voter intimidation -- keeping some people from voting through excessive (illegal) regulations and perceived threats. Suggesting rigged elections is a serious threat to the very foundation of a free, democratic society -- an orderly transfer of power. This is something about which Trump knows little and seemingly cares less. As far as he's concerned, if he doesn't win, the powers that be must be against him. The press. Ah, the press. ""They can say anything they want,"" he complained the other day. No kidding, Sherlock. You just noticed? He says if he's president he's going to change that and strip the major media companies of their power. He can try, of course. It won't be easy though. You see, Donald, those same forefathers who were so wise as to guarantee Americans the right to bear arms in that Second Amendment you and your followers are so fond of spouting and shouting about thought the idea of a free and unfettered press was so important to a functioning democracy that they wrote it into the First Amendment of the Constitution. That's one ahead of the guns amendment, which some might say suggests it is more important. Since a civics lesson is apparently in order for Trumpers, it should be noted that the First Amendment also guarantees everyone freedom of religion. Which is also to say, freedom from your religion. 
But these are mere facts and Trump and the folks at Fox News have demonstrated the power of repeating false news over and over again until listeners -- like the inhabitants of Orwell's ""1984"" -- simply take it for fact. We have always been at war with Eurasia. We have never been at war with Eurasia. Love is hate. War is peace. I know Putin well. I never met the man. - Advertisement - 
We are told that many Trump supporters -- virtually all of them white and the majority male -- are angry and frustrated with their lives. Somehow, goes the argument, all those black, brown, Muslim, Mexican, gay, Jewish, Arab, Asian people who don't belong here -- and some pushy American women as well -- have prevented these Trump fans from realizing the American Dream. They took all the jobs and live on welfare. Love is hate. Up is down. Bigotry has nothing to do with it. We just want to make America great again, like before all those other people said they wanted to enjoy the American Dream, too. 
Enough already. At some point in a person's life, if he or she is lucky, the opportunity presents itself to take responsibility for one's actions. To take stock of how things are going. Not materially, but really. It can be frightening. It can also be rewarding. Among other things, this look in the mirror allows one to say -- if one can be honest -- ""I've made some mistakes. I sincerely regret them. I hope to do better from now on."" A lot of people never do this. 
With that runaway train called Trump menacing the trust and tolerance that are the pillars of our, yes, already great nation, I'm thinking that a lot of people -- a lot of white, Republican people -- have a date with a mirror. It's far too late to undo the damage Trump has done or to deny any part in it, but it's not too late to admit the mistake of supporting him in spite of all the hateful, false things he said. It's not too late to admit to acting as if he didn't say them because, well, maybe because you were angry or confused or frightened or thought it would be disloyal. Maybe you feel you were lied to. Or maybe you just wanted to believe the lies. 
Republican politicians who have stuck with Trump have no such out. The McCains and Ryans and Cruzes and Rubios knew Trump was bad news from day one. But he was their bad news and his lies became their lies even when they disagreed with him, because they never had the courage -- the humility, the simple decency -- to look in the mirror and say: ""Enough. This man is obscene. He is an insult to our party and our nation. We made a grave mistake in pandering to the worst instincts of some of our party members in order to get their votes. Our pride kept us from admitting this. Fear drove our decisions. We allowed him to make fools of us. Indeed, we made fools of ourselves."" 
Speaking, if I may, for the rest of an angry, resentful nation, that day of reckoning can't come soon enough. - Advertisement -",1
Resilience in Baltimore: A Bottom-Up Example of People Taking Charge,"(42 fans) - Advertisement - In my research of what is happening in our communities regarding resilience from the insanity of today's corporate and government behaviors, I came across this Maryland Community Pilot study. This study is listed as being written this year, 2016. This makes the research fresh. To give credence to this movement, consider some of the investigators for the study. People like: * Karen Akerlof, Center for Climate Change Communication, George Mason University * Fredrika Moser, Maryland Sea Grant * Kristin Baja, Office of Sustainability I could continue on and on. My point is, the people involved are professionals and not whacked out ""greenies"". There are four Maryland neighborhoods involved in the study. Some of the neighborhood climate risks entail: Flooding and sewage overflows from storm water run-off, urban heat island effects, pollen allergens, increased air pollution, storms, riverine flooding (in Westport). - Advertisement - The vulnerabilities include: Low socioeconomic populations, racial disparities, vacant housing, poor health and air quality (Baltimore), industrial facilities (Westport) The site further states that Communities are beginning to plan efforts to consider adaptation strategies to build their resilience (NRC, 2010), yet many lack the political capital or access to information and resources that would allow them to prepare for chronic flooding, catastrophic storm events, and losses of economically important natural resources. Frequently, it is underserved and underrepresented communities that lack these resources and are most vulnerable to the effects of changing environmental conditions (Douglas et al., 2011; Melillo, Richmond, & Yohe,2014). Storm events are particularly devastating to socially vulnerable communities, even when controlling for infrastructure characteristics (Highfield, Peacock, & Zandt, 2014). - Advertisement - Meeting the needs of high-risk/low-resource communities is one of the most critical challenges in achieving resilience nationally (NRC, 2010), but little tailored information exists to guide program development specifically for these contexts (NOAA, 2015). Moreover, our understanding of the conditions under which audiences are most likely to engage in successful decision-making to reduce vulnerabilities is still evolving (Webler, Tuler, Dow, Whitehead, & Kettle, 2014). ""Build resistance to what?"" you may ask. Personally I use the term resilience. It's more positive. Resilience as I define it is the adoption of behaviors and programs that lead to a supportive and clean environment, healthy families and a vibrant you.",1
"At DAPL, Confiscating Cameras as Evidence of Journalism","Reprinted from fair.org by Janine Jackson Militarily Armed Police License DMCA 
While elite media wait for the resistance to the Dakota Access Pipeline to go away so they can return to presenting their own chin-stroking as what it means to take climate change seriously , independent media continue to fill the void with actual coverage. 
One place you can go to find reporting is The Intercept ( 10/25/16 ), where journalist Jihan Hafiz filed a video report from North Dakota, where the Standing Rock Sioux and their allies continue their stand against the sacred site--trampling, water supply--threatening project. 
Hafiz reports that after a morning of prayer, Standing Rock activists 
were attacked by police forces who used pepper spray and beat protesters with batons"". Dozens of officers, backed by military trucks, police vans, machine guns and nonlethal weapons, violently approached the group without warning. 
As the demonstrators attempted to leave, the police began beating and detaining them. Several Native American women leading the march were targeted, dragged out of the crowd and arrested. One man was body-slammed to the ground, while another woman broke her ankle running from the police. The military and police trucks followed the protesters, as nearly a hundred officers corralled them into a circle. Among the arrested were journalists--including Hafiz--a pregnant 17-year-old and a 78-year-old woman. - Advertisement - 
Once jailed, Hafiz and others were refused phone calls and received no food or water for eight hours. Women were strip-searched, two women fainted from low blood sugar and another had her medication taken away. 
On her release, Hafiz was told, ""Your camera is being held as evidence in a crime."" 
That crime, of course, would be journalism . And it's hard to believe law enforcement would feel so cavalier about treating it that way if more reporters were actually committing it. Protest against the Dakota Access Pipeline License DMCA - Advertisement -

Tom Hayden's Haunting,"License DMCA 
As an old SDS-er, I found it hard to see Tom Hayden go. However meandering his path, he was at the heart of radical history in the 60s, an erstwhile companion, if not always a comrade, on the route of every boomer lefty. 
One of his finer moments for me, which I've never seen mentioned (including among this week's encomia) since he wrote it, was his 2006 article , published on CounterPunch with an introduction by Alexander Cockburn, in which he apologized for a ""descent into moral ambiguity and realpolitick that still haunts me today."" It would be respectful of Hayden's admirers and critics, on the occasion of his passing, to remember which of his actions ""haunted"" him the most. 
The title of the article says it clearly: ""I Was Israel's Dupe."" In the essay, Hayden apologizes for his support of the Israeli invasion of Lebanon in 1982, which was for him that ""descent into moral ambiguity"" More importantly, he explains why he did it, in a detailed narrative that everyone should read. 
Hayden sold out, as he tells it, because, in order to run as a Democratic candidate for the California State Assembly, he had to get the approval of the influential Democratic congressman Howard Berman. Berman is a guy who, when he became Chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, was proud to tell the Forward that he took the job because of his ""interest in the Jewish state"" and that: ""Even before I was a Democrat, I was a Zionist."" 
Hayden had to meet with Howard's brother Michael, who, acting as ""the gatekeeper protecting Los Angeles' Westside for Israel's political interests,"" told Hayden: ""I represent the Israeli Defense Forces""--a sentence that could serve as the motto of most American congress critters today. The ""Berman-Waxman machine,"" Hayden was told, would deign to ""rent"" him the Assembly seat on the ""one condition: that I always be a 'good friend of Israel.'"" 
But American congressmen were not the only ""gatekeepers"" through whose hands Hayden had to pass before being allowed to run for Congress. Other ""certifiers"" included ""the elites, beginning with rabbis and heads of the multiple mainstream Jewish organizations,"" the American-Israel Political Action Committee (AIPAC), ""[and].. Israeli ambassadors, counsels general and other officials."" - Advertisement - 
In fact, Hayden had to, in his words, be ""declared 'kosher' by the ultimate source, the region's representative of the state of Israel,"" Benjamin Navon, Israel's Counsul-general in Los Angeles. 
In other words, in this article Hayden was describing, in an unusually concrete way, how the state of Israel, through its state officials and their compliant American partners, was effectively managing--exercising veto power over Democratic Party candidates, at the very least--American elections down to the level of State Assembly . In any constituency ""attuned to the question of Israel, even in local and state elections,"" Hayden knew he ""had to be certified 'kosher,' not once but over and over again."" 
This experience prompted Hayden to express a ""fear ""that the 'Israeli lobby' is working overtime to influence American public opinion on behalf of Israel's military effort to 'roll back the clock' and 'change the map' of the region."" Hayden warned of the ""trepidation and confusion among rank-and-file voters and activists, and the paralysis of politicians, especially Democrats,"" over support of Israel. He vowed to ""not make the same mistake again,"" and said: ""Most important, Americans must not be timid in speaking up, as I was 25 years ago."" 
Whatever else he did--and he was never particularly radical about Palestine--this article was a genuinely honest and unusual intervention, and it deserves a lot more notice--as a moment in Tom Hayden's history and that of the American left--than it has got. Looking back and regretfully acknowledging that one had been duped and morally compromised by what seemed the least troublesome path 25 years earlier, saying ""I woulda, shoulda, coulda done the right thing,"" is a haunting moment for anyone. Doing it in a way that exposes in detail how a foreign country constantly manipulates American elections over decades is worthy of everyone's notice. 
I doubt Hillary and her Democratic supporters will have anything to say about this ""interference ""in American elections, even local and state. But I do hope many of those who are touched by the loss of Tom Hayden heed these words from him, and don't wait another 25 years to overcome their ""fear and confusion"" about saying and doing the right thing regarding the crimes of Israel, troublesome as that might be. - Advertisement -",1

Hillary Clinton has a deep commitment.,"(7 fans) - Advertisement - 
Hillary Clinton is very sincere and is committed to economy, employment, refugees, immigration and health reforms as a means of making lasting change in the US and in the world. Now we need to take concrete action and not waste time in rhetoric. Hillary Clinton is committed to build an infrastructure of education, employment, health care, small business, free press, electrical power, communications and transportation. Hillary Clinton has a deep commitment. She is active in our educational and development community, include her involvement with the government and with leaders. She played an important role in offering outreach to the people including women and children. We must vote for her. We should remember that the first condition for economic reforms is good leaders, and employment. Good leaders and employment opportunities are necessary not only for the economic growth but also for the security, physical well being and psychological comfort of the American citizens. US has always been demonstrated a decent and sustained growth rate because of a fully functioning democratic system. The pillars of the US democratic system include regular elections, peaceful transfer of power, American people's involvement in all development programs, and a reliable power among the states. This has enabled US to pursue a policy of economic liberalization, massive educational improvement and of providing a solid investment in a long-term perspective. Yes, US still suffers from unemployment, and faces challenges; these problems seem solvable soon. US needs to establish and implement long-term policies of economic growth. It should also create a well-organized and comprehensive development vision that all the political leaders should agree to follow. Making appropriate investments in our roads, electrification, and extension services would help considerably in improving Americans lives. Increasing investment in basic education and health care are important in ensuring that the poor participate meaningfully in the economic growth. A lack of education and health care hurts the poor today. And finally, President Hillary Clinton must focus on generating high rates of sustainable growth while ensuring that the benefits of that growth is spread to all parts of states. As we know, the solutions are the same everywhere, have a society based on equity and justice for everyone. - Advertisement - As we know, most countries do the opposite. Discrimination against women and children today is as bad as decades ago. It's always the issue of the privileged not caring, the poor get hurt and people of color and women especially get hurt the most. Thus, vote for Hillary Clinton, because the role of the leaders is more important and they can assist people's movements for economic growth. - Advertisement -",1
Why FBI Director James Comey did the wrong thing ... again,"License DMCA 
The New York Times headline article sums up Comey's dilemma aptly enough. 
""Mr. Comey could immediately inform Congress about the emails, which were found in an investigation into former Representative Anthony D. Weiner. That unusual step, months after Mr. Comey had cleared Mrs. Clinton of any criminal wrongdoing in the email case, would risk accusations that he was unfairly harming her presidential campaign less than two weeks before the election. 
""Or he could delay any announcement and examine the new emails more closely, risking criticism that he had suppressed important new information if it came out after the election, despite his pledges of ""transparency"" in the investigation."" 
And with that, the choice should have been obvious -- Comey shouldn't have made any announcement. There shouldn't have been a decision to make. - Advertisement - 
That there was even a choice in Comey's mind comes back to the same thing that's caused the FBI Director to err at every single stage of this investigation. It's not that ""Jim Comey is an apolitical straight shooter,"" as every talking head is eager to tell you. It's that Jim Comey is very concerned that he be seen as an apolitical straight shooter. Because of that, he has, repeatedly, put preservation of his own reputation ahead of both justice and the good of the nation. 
From his ludicrous, finger-wagging press gaggle in announcing Clinton's innocence, to his ham-fisted intrusion into the final act of the election, Comey has felt compelled to insert Jim Comey, straight-shooter, into every moment. 
As a result he's caused serious harm to the FBI, to the election, and to the nation. And, just incidentally, he's ruined his reputation in the process. 
Across the nation, prosecuting attorneys are not exactly the most modest or retiring of public servants. It's a position of unique power, and often engages the most vaunting egos. And yet, Comey has managed to shock those people whose responsibilities are most like his own. 
""'It is not the function of the FBI director to be making public pronouncements about an investigation, never mind about an investigation based on evidence that he acknowledges may not be significant,' [former assistant U.S. attorney] Akerman added. 'The job of the FBI is simply to investigate and to provide the results of its investigation to the prosecutorial arm of the U.S. Department of Justice. His job is not to give a running commentary about any investigation or his opinion about any investigation. This is particularly egregious since Secretary Clinton has no way to respond to what amounts to nebulous and speculative innuendo.'"" - Advertisement - 
It's not enough for Comey to do his job. He wants to be seen doing his job. He worries about the eyes of history, the verdict of time. Which is exactly where, and why, Comey failed. 
Doing the right thing means doing what you believe is proper even if the verdict of history comes against you. It means being willing to be seen as biased, or not transparent, or simply wrong. Doing the right thing risks finding that what you did was actually wrong. You must act on what you know, and do the best regardless. 
But Comey was more concerned that he be seen as doing the right thing. And that's ... a completely different thing. 
In essence, James Comey set his ego above the good of the country. That's not illegal, but it's certainly not right.",1
The De Facto US/Al Qaeda Alliance,"License DMCA 
A curious aspect of the Syrian conflict -- a rebellion sponsored largely by the United States and its Gulf state allies -- is the disappearance in much of the American mainstream news media of references to the prominent role played by Al Qaeda in seeking to overthrow the secular Syrian government of Bashar al-Assad. 
There's much said in the U.S. press about ISIS, the former ""Al Qaeda in Iraq"" which splintered off several years ago, but Al Qaeda's central role in commanding Syria's ""moderate"" rebels in Aleppo and elsewhere is the almost unspoken reality of the Syrian war. Even in the U.S. presidential debates, the arguing between Republican Donald Trump and Democrat Hillary Clinton has been almost exclusively about ISIS, not Al Qaeda. 
Though Al Qaeda got the ball rolling on America's revenge wars in the Middle East 15 years ago by killing several thousand Americans and others in the 9/11 attacks, the terrorist group has faded into the background of U.S. attention, most likely because it messes up the preferred ""good guy/bad guy"" narrative regarding the Syrian war. 
For instance, the conflict in Aleppo between Syrian government forces and rebels operating primarily under Al Qaeda's command is treated in the Western media as simply a case of the barbaric Assad and his evil Russian ally Vladimir Putin mercilessly bombing what is portrayed as the east Aleppo equivalent of Disney World, a place where innocent children and their families peacefully congregate until they are targeted for death by the Assad-Putin war-crime family. 
The photos sent out to the world by skillful rebel propagandists are almost always of wounded children being cared for by the "" White Helmet"" rebel civil defense corps , which has come under growing criticism for serving as a public-relations arm of Al Qaeda and other insurgents. (There also are allegations that some of the most notable images have been staged , like a fake war scene from the 1997 dark comedy, ""Wag the Dog."") - Advertisement - 
Rare Glimpse of Truth 
Yet, occasionally, the reality of Al Qaeda's importance in the rebellion breaks through, even in the mainstream U.S. media, although usually downplayed and deep inside the news pages, such as the A9 article in Saturday's New York Times by Hwaida Saad and Anne Barnard describing a rebel offensive in Aleppo. It acknowledges: 
""The new offensive was a strong sign that rebel groups vetted by the United States were continuing their tactical alliances with groups linked to Al Qaeda, rather than distancing themselves as Russia has demanded and the Americans have urged. ... The rebels argue that they cannot afford to shun any potential allies while they are under fire, including well-armed and motivated jihadists, without more robust aid from their international backers."" (You might note how the article subtly blames the rebel dependence on Al Qaeda on the lack of ""robust aid"" from the Obama administration and other outside countries -- even though such arms shipments violate international law.) 
What the article also makes clear in a hazy kind of way is that Al Qaeda's affiliate, the recently renamed Nusra Front, and its jihadist allies, such as Ahrar al-Sham, are waging the brunt of the fighting while the CIA-vetted ""moderates"" are serving in mostly support roles. The Times reported: 
""The insurgents have a diverse range of objectives and backers, but they issued statements of unity on Friday. Those taking part in the offensive include the Levant Conquest Front, a militant group formerly known as the Nusra Front that grew out of Al Qaeda; another hard-line Islamist faction, Ahrar al-Sham; and other rebel factions fighting Mr. Assad that have been vetted by the United States and its allies."" - Advertisement - 
The article cites Charles Lister, a senior fellow and Syria specialist at the Middle East Institute in Washington, and other analysts noting that ""the vast majority of the American-vetted rebel factions in Aleppo were fighting inside the city itself and conducting significant bombardments against Syrian government troops in support of the Qaeda-affiliated fighters carrying out the brunt of front-line fighting."" 
Lister noted that 11 of the 20 or so rebel groups conducting the Aleppo ""offensive have been vetted by the C.I.A. and have received arms from the agency, including anti-tank missiles. ... 
""In addition to arms provided by the United States, much of the rebels' weaponry comes from regional states, like Turkey, Qatar and Saudi Arabia,"" Mr. Lister said, ""including truck-borne multiple-rocket launcher systems and Czech-made Grad rockets with extended ranges.""

Who Took the Mercury Out of Vaccines?,"(4 fans) - Advertisement - 
Jill Stein, a medical doctor who is running for President on the Green Party ticket, has claimed that the pharmaceutical industry has a corrupting influence on the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). She has also claimed that she was part of a public-health movement that led to the removal of mercury from childhood vaccines. In reality, we have no evidence that the mercury in childhood vaccines was causing any harm. Nor was any grassroots organization, other than the American Academy of Pediatrics, involved in the decision to stop using a mercury compound called thimerosal as a preservative in vaccines. (Stein is an internist, not a pediatrician.) The decision to make childhood vaccinations mercury-free was made by the FDA and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). Prominent antivaccination activists started speaking out about mercury in vaccines only after the vaccines became mercury-free. 
It is disturbing that Republican and Green Party presidential hopefuls, including some medical doctors, have been using the talking points of the antivaccination movement. What's worse is that any medical doctor, and especially any medical doctor who wants to be chief executive of the federal government, does not seem to know how the federal government works to protect public health. 
Many laymen were horrified to hear that a mercury compound was ever being used as an ingredient in childhood vaccines. Yet that mercury compound is a powerful preservative that was being used to solve a serious safety problem. This problem became obvious in 1928, in a disaster called the Bundaberg Tragedy. A bottle of diphtheria vaccine in a doctor's office in Bundaberg, Queensland, Australia, became contaminated with a bacterium called golden staph (Staphylococcus aureus). The bacterium was probably carried into the bottle by the needle that was used to draw out one of the first doses from the bottle. Then, the bacteria grew inside the bottle as it sat on a shelf between doses. Twelve of the children who received vaccine from this contaminated bottle died. Five others became seriously ill but recovered. To prevent a similar tragedy from happening in the United States, the US Code of Federal Regulations (21CFR610.15) requires vaccine makers to put a preservative in multiple-dose containers of practically all vaccines. Single-dose containers can be preservative-free but are more expensive. 
The regulation does not specify which preservatives must be used. However, it does say that the preservative must be ""sufficiently nontoxic so that the amount present in the recommended dose of the product will not be toxic to the recipient."" Also, the preservative must not interfere with the potency of the vaccine. Thimerosal has been used since the 1930s as a preservative in vaccines because it was the most effective option, it did not interfere with the potency of the vaccine, and it was well tolerated. Thimerosal has also been used as a preservative in contact-lens solutions. Even today, despite an extensive research effort, we have no evidence that the use of thimerosal in vaccines has caused any health problems. 
The person who raised the question of the mercury content of medicines (not specifically vaccines) was Frank Pallone, a Democratic Congressman from New Jersey. In 1997, he introduced an amendment to the FDA's reauthorization bill. This amendment gave FDA two years to compile a list of all medicinal products that contain mercury compounds as ingredients. The FDA had to analyze what kind of mercury compound was in each product, and how much of each mercury compound the product contains. In response to this congressional mandate, the FDA revisited the question of how much exposure children were getting to thimerosal through their vaccinations. 
Because of the introduction of some new vaccines, the amount of thimerosal that children were receiving had gone up. In 1999, scientists at the FDA calculated that the recommended vaccines would deliver a total of 187.5 micrograms of mercury. (A microgram is a millionth of a gram.) However, there was no reliable way to judge whether this amount of mercury exposure is a problem. In the human body, thimerosal is broken down into ethylmercury, but the federal guidelines on mercury toxicity were based on methylmercury. To be on the safe side, the scientists assumed that ethylmercury would be just as dangerous as methylmercury. (We now know that it is not, because it is quickly eliminated through the kidneys.) So they suggested that steps be taken to reduce thimerosal exposure. Back in 1999, we had no evidence that the thimerosal in vaccines was causing problems. By now, we have evidence that it was not causing any of the health problems that were investigated. However, it did become a serious public-relations problem. - Advertisement - 
The FDA and the CDC take vaccine safety seriously. As a result, the recommended vaccines are amazingly safe. Yet there is one thing that we can do to improve safety still further, while restoring public trust in the public-health authorities. We must focus on driving diseases like polio, measles, and rubella into extinction through vaccination. Once a disease is extinct, everyone is protected against it, forever. As a result, children do not need to be exposed to even the minimal risks, and the discomfort, of the vaccination. Instantly, the sales of the vaccine drop to zero. By working to eradicate a vaccine-preventable disease, we public-health activists make it crystal clear that our goal is public health, not private profit. - Advertisement -",1
When Will It End? Police Clash with Pipeline Protesters,"License DMCA 
It's like we are back to the 1800s when the U.S. Army rampaged against Native American tribes across the American West. The militarized police and the use of the National Guard this week in responding to the Standing Rock Sioux Native American challenge in North Dakota to big oil and its dangerous pipelines reminds one of Custer's Last Stand against Sitting Bull. 
In fact, the portrait of Sitting Bull is on one of the most popular t-shirts available to supporters of the ""water protectors,"" as those are known who protest yet one more oil pipeline that crosses sensitive watershed areas and major rivers of the United States. 
Four days last week, I joined hundreds of Native Americans and social justice campaigners from around the United States and around the world, in challenging the Dakota Access Pipe Line (DAPL), the 1,172-mile, $3.7 billion dollar scar across the face of North Dakota, South Dakota, Iowa and Illinois. 
Last week, I photographed the area along Highway 6 south of Bismarck where the Energy Transfer Partnership contractors were busy digging the trench for the ""Black Snake"" as the pipeline is called. License DMCA - Advertisement - 
I also counted 24 police cars returning to Bismarck at shift change around 3 p.m., a huge number of state law enforcement personnel and vehicles dedicated to protection of corporate business, instead of the rights of citizens. 
Huge machines were chewing up the earth near water sources for all of North Dakota. The pipeline was rerouted from near Bismarck so if the pipeline breaks it would not endanger the water supply of the capital city of the state. But it was relocated to where it will cross the Missouri River and will jeopardize the water supply of the Native Americans and all Americans living in southern North Dakota and downstream of the Missouri River. Security forces protecting the Dakota Access pipeline construction spray protesters with pepper spray. License DMCA - Advertisement - 
On Thursday, the digging took a more confrontational turn. The huge digging equipment arrived to cut across State Highway 1806 at a spot where water protectors had set up a front-line camp several months ago, one mile north of the main encampment of over 1,000 people. As the equipment arrived, the ""water protectors"" blocked the highway. 
In a dangerous incident, an armed private security guard of DAPL came onto the camp and was chased off into the water abutting the camp by water protectors. After a lengthy standoff, tribal agency police arrived and arrested the security guard. Water protectors set his security vehicle on fire. 
On Friday more than 100 local and state police and North Dakota National Guard arrested over 140 people who blocked the highway attempting to stop the destruction of the land. Police in riot gear with automatic rifles lined up across a highway, with multiple MRAPs (mine-resistant ambush protected military vehicles), a sound cannon that can immobilize persons nearby, Humvees driven by National Guardsmen, an armored police truck and a bulldozer. 
Police used mace, pepper spray, tear gas and flash-bang grenades and bean-bag rounds against Native Americans who lined up on the highway. Police reportedly shot rubber bullets at their horses and wounded one rider and his horse. 
As this police mayhem was unfolding, a small herd of buffalo stampeded across a nearby field, a strong symbolic signal to the water protectors who erupted in cheers and shouts, leaving law enforcement officials wondering what was happening. The security forces protecting the Dakota Access pipeline against protesters are heavily militarized.",1

Here's What I'll Do the Day After Election Day,"License DMCA 
I am currently working as hard as I can to see that Donald Trump is defeated, that Hillary Clinton is elected president, and that Democrats gain control of the US House and Senate. The day after the election, working with millions of grass-roots activists, I intend to do everything possible to make certain that the new president and Congress implement the Democratic platform, the most progressive agenda of any major political party in the history of the United States. 
That agenda includes overturning the disastrous Supreme Court decision on Citizens United, raising the minimum wage to $15 an hour, expanding Social Security, breaking up ""too-big-to-fail banks,"" making public colleges and universities tuition-free for the middle class, and rebuilding our crumbling infrastructure. It also includes pay equity for women, a new approach toward trade, aggressive action to combat climate change, raising taxes on the wealthy and large corporations, lowering prescription drug prices, a significant movement toward universal health care, and major reforms in our criminal justice and immigration systems. 
If this election has taught us anything, it is that the American people are sick and tired of the economic, political, and media status quo. They are tired of a rigged economy in which millions work longer hours for lower wages while 52 percent of all new income goes to the top 1 percent. They are tired of billionaires like Trump and large profitable corporations not paying a nickel in federal income taxes while the middle class pays their fair share to support governmental services. They are tired of a corrupt campaign finance system that allows billionaires like the Koch brothers, Sheldon Adelson, and others to spend hundreds of millions to elect candidates who will represent the wealthy and the powerful. They are tired of corporate media that focus on political gossip and look at elections as personality contests, rather than provide for a serious discussion of the major crises facing our country. 
The anger and frustration of the American people, all across the political spectrum, is palpable. They want a government that represents the needs of working families and not just billionaires. They want bold action to rebuild the shrinking middle class, not inside-the-beltway palliatives written by corporate lobbyists. 
At a time of massive political discontent, when millions not only are contemptuous of the major political parties but are also actually giving up on democracy, we need a new administration that has both vision and courage. We need vision from the top to point the way toward a new America that is more inclusive and egalitarian -- which boldly addresses income and wealth inequality, poverty, and the needs of the uninsured. We need an administration that has the courage to take on the powerful special interests -- corporate America, Wall Street, the insurance and drug companies, the fossil fuel industry -- who stand in the way of real change and whose greed is destroying this country. - Advertisement - 
There is no moral excuse for the top one-tenth of 1 percent owning as much wealth as the bottom 90 percent, for one family (the Waltons) having more wealth than the bottom 42 percent of our population, for the number of billionaires increasing by ten-fold since 2000 while we continue to have the highest rate of childhood poverty of almost any industrialized country on earth. 
There is no rational reason why we remain the only major country not to guarantee health care to all as a right or provide paid family and medical leave, or why we have more people in jail than any other country on earth at the same time as we have outrageously high levels of youth unemployment in minority communities. 
Too many Americans are living in despair and hopelessness. Too many of our brothers and sisters are turning to drugs, alcohol and suicide to avoid the painful economic realities of their lives. Too many others are turning to rage and bigotry as they try to make sense of their declining standard of living. 
At a time of hateful political division, a new president can bring our people together by leading and appointing an administration that will fight for working people. We need a secretary of treasury who is prepared to take on the greed and illegal behavior of Wall Street, not someone who comes from Wall Street or will leave office to go to Wall Street. We need a trade representative who understands that our current trade policies have failed, and that we must adopt a trade approach that represents workers and not the CEOs of large corporations. We need an attorney general who is prepared to vigorously enforce antitrust laws and prosecute bankers and corporate leaders who break the law. 
This is an historic and pivotal moment in American history. Now is the time for our next president to rally the American people against Wall Street and corporate greed and stand up vigorously for the declining middle class. - Advertisement -",1
What Is Racism?,"License DMCA Racism is generally thought of as discriminating against any group of people because of certain distinctive physical features they have in common. The barren shallowness of this definition is itself actually characteristic of the 'consciousness' of people who engage in racist attitude and orientation. To find the real roots of racism we have to go down to the level of culture formation itself. It is here that what we call racism becomes inevitable. Racism does not exist merely as a flaw in cultural formation. It is an innate feature of culture formation because of what culture has always historically shown itself to be. All culture formation begins in the response of awareness to reality as experienced through the filter of this particular awareness. Everything we know about human pre-history and history tells us that fear plays a radical role in culture formation. The very fact that culture formation is a group response rather than being characterizes by any significant degree of individuality supports this thesis. The group forms as a means of protection against real possibilities of danger. Reality is perceived as dangerous, or at least as presenting possibilities of danger. And ultimately reality means the apparently inescapable mystery of mortality, which is anything but welcome and non-threatening. - Advertisement - The group forms as a means of protection and as the group develops, its group identity begins to form the rudiments of culture. This culture identity has fear as part of its elementary constitution. And the primary means of countering the threats this fear perceives is to find and develop features of reality that affirm the group identity. This involves both finding actual features in and projecting desired features onto reality. And the primary projection always involves seeing reality as having a face that affirms and reflects the face of the group itself. And this absolutely includes affirmation of the physical characteristics of the group. These physical characteristics become inseparable from the entire cultural panoply. This does not mean that culture is simply fantasy. But the fact that there are real elements in any culture only fortifies the fantasy elements and makes them indistinguishable from the real. The iconic imagery of all cultures shows the superhuman higher powers as having features that precisely reflect the features of the human group that develops this imagery. This is not merely coincidental or accidental. It shows that the human group has a fear-based emotional need to believe its particular features, which are subject to mortality, are, in spite of this fact, the features of truth . Truth becomes the protective shield of the distinctively featured group. And it must be kept in mind that this Truth is Absolute Truth (God) and therefore gives an Absolute value to the features of the group. So any human feature or behavior that varies from this group-truth is seen as at least potentially threatening and dangerous and can easily be seen as evil . But wherever it falls in the spectrum of evaluation, it is always alien and suspect because it challenges the group-truth-identity with existential fear at its foundation. The fact that aspects of culture such as art and religion can bring a joy to the people of a particular culture does not nullify anything I have said. And it also does not mean that these aspects are of no real value. But it does reveal the fact that even these aspects are of limited reality-value. And this limit is exposed by the existence of other humans who have developed a clearly different culture. The problem of racism is precisely the problem of how humans develop the Reality-Truth picture that sustains them as a group. Paranoid fear of a person or group with different physical and psychological-orientation features is not just arrogance. It involves an existential fear of identity dissolution and it reflects the failure to adequately deal with this fear in human history. Some degree of racism exists wherever culture exists. The idea that racism is a feature of exclusively any one group of people is ludicrous and very dangerous. It's all about human fear-constriction and the human desire for power over what is frightening in reality rather than expanding further into reality and keeping an open-ended identity. It is the result of partial human identity development pretending to be absolute and finished. To end racism means to end desperate attachment to dangerously undeveloped identity. It means consciousness expansion to a depth that reveals all culture as relative in truth-value and all humans as transitional forms in evolutionary movement. We are all racist because we are all afraid of reality and its evolutionary movement. The solution to this is not the development of black culture, or white culture, or yellow culture... The solution is the development of a fearless open-ended human culture and such a culture does not yet exist anywhere on the earth. Until it does humanity is in danger of self-destruction. In the present context of American society there is no ready solution to racial discrimination because there are no social structures that feed the consciousness expansion required. This oligarchic society is the death-cold pyramid of human fear of reality that feeds the forces of exploitation, abuse, and neglect. It induces pathological behavior from the top of the pyramid to the bottom. The solution to the rabid discrimination against Native Americans and African Americans at the bottom of the pyramid is not the popularizing of Native-American or African-American culture that just ends up as pulp for the amoral capitalist machine in the form of decadent and feckless entertainment. The solution is the creation of a human culture that is genuinely open to everyone because it encompasses all human experience and response. There is no other solution. However politically incorrect it might be, there is no other solution. - Advertisement -",1
Why Dakota Is the New Keystone,"License DMCA 
MIDDLEBURY, Vt. -- The Native Americans who have spent the last months in peaceful protest against an oil pipeline along the banks of the Missouri are standing up for tribal rights. They're also standing up for clean water, environmental justice and a working climate. And it's time that everyone else joined in. 
The shocking images of the National Guard destroying tepees and sweat lodges and arresting elders this week remind us that the battle over the Dakota Access Pipeline is part of the longest-running drama in American history -- the United States Army versus Native Americans. In the past, it's almost always ended horribly, and nothing we can do now will erase a history of massacres, stolen land and broken treaties. But this time, it can end differently. 
Those heroes on the Standing Rock reservation, sometimes on horseback, have peacefully stood up to police dogs, pepper spray and the bizarre-looking militarized tanks and SWAT teams that are the stuff of modern policing. (Modern and old-fashioned both: The pictures of German shepherds attacking are all too reminiscent of photos from, say, Birmingham, Ala., in 1963.) 
The courage of those protesters managed to move the White House enough that the government called a temporary halt to construction. But the forces that want it finished -- Big Oil, and its allies in parts of the labor movement -- are strong enough that the respite may be temporary. 
In coming weeks, activists will respond to calls from the leaders at Standing Rock by gathering at the offices of banks funding the pipeline, and at the offices of the Army Corps of Engineers, for protest and civil disobedience. Two dozen big banks have lent money to the pipeline project, even though many of them have also adopted elaborate environmental codes . As for the Corps, that's the agency that helped ""expedite"" the approval of the pipeline -- and must still grant the final few permits. The vast movement of people across the country who mobilized to block fossil-fuel projects like the Keystone pipeline and Shell's plans to drill in the Arctic need to gather once more. This time, their message must be broader still. - Advertisement - 
There are at least two grounds for demanding a full environmental review of this pipeline, instead of the fast-track approvals it has received so far. The first is the obvious environmental racism of the whole project. 
Originally, the pipeline was supposed to cross the Missouri just north of Bismarck , until people pointed out that a leak there would threaten the drinking water supply for North Dakota's second biggest city. The solution, in keeping with American history, was obvious: make the crossing instead just above the Standing Rock reservation, where the poverty rate is nearly three times the national average. This has been like watching the start of another Flint, Mich., except with a chance to stop it. 
The second is that this is precisely the kind of project that climate science tells us can no longer be tolerated. In midsummer, the Obama administration promised that henceforth there would be a climate test for new projects before they could be approved. That promise was codified in the Democratic platform approved by Hillary Clinton's campaign, which says there will be no federal approval for any project that ""significantly exacerbates"" global warming. 
The review of the Dakota pipeline must take both cases into account. 
So far, the signs are not good. There has been no word from the White House about how long the current pause will last. Now, the company building the pipeline has pushed the local authorities to remove protesters from land where construction has already desecrated indigenous burial sites, with law enforcement agents using Tasers, batons, mace and ""sound cannons."" - Advertisement - 
From the Clinton campaign, there's been simply an ugly silence, perhaps rooted in an unwillingness to cross major contributors like the Laborers' International Union of North America , which has lashed out against the many other, larger unions that oppose the project. But that silence won't make the issue go away: Sioux protesters erected a tepee in her Brooklyn campaign office on Thursday. If Mrs. Clinton is elected on Nov. 8, this will be the new president's first test on environmental and human rights. 
What's happening along the Missouri is of historic consequence. That message should reverberate not just on the lonely high plains, but in our biggest cities, too. Native Americans have carried the fight, but they deserve backup from everyone with a conscience; other activists should join the protest at bank headquarters, Army Corps offices and other sites of entrenched power. 
The Native Americans are the only people who have inhabited this continent in harmony with nature for centuries. Their traditional wisdom now chimes perfectly with the latest climate science. The only thing missing are the bodies of the rest of us joining in their protest. If we use them wisely, a fresh start is possible.

Why Hillary won't unleash WWIII,"No-fly zone would ""require war with # Syria and # Russia "" -- top US general http:// on.rt.com/7q0t - Advertisement - 6:15 PM - 22 Sep 2016 
Predictably, the Clinton (cash) machine has been relentless promoting Hillary's no-fly zone. Whenever cornered, the machine switches the narrative to Russian hacking of the DNC. Edward Snowden, who knows a thing or two about cyberwarfare, stresses there is no solid proof Russian intel hacked the Democratic/Clinton machine. And if they actually did it, the NSA would know. The fact the NSA is mum reveals this is no more than information war. Pass the missile launchers, please 
Trump seems to have been more on the money when he insisted how Hillary will be outsmarted -- as she already was in the past -- when dealing with President Putin, who she has demonized as Hitler. 
I have shown how Hillary will be prevented from launching WWIII because her no-fly zone is already implemented in Syria by Russia. And the Pentagon -- reflecting Dunford's comments -- knows it, no matter how emphatically soon-to-be-unemployed Pentagon head Ash Carter threatens "" consequences ."" 
The Pentagon ranks Russia and China as the number one and two ""existential threats"" to US national security, in that order. And the US government reserves for itself the privilege of a nuclear ""first-strike"" -- which Hillary supports (but not Trump); this is part of the 2002 Full Spectrum Dominance doctrine.",1
How America lost its moral authority throughout the world,"Become a Fan - Advertisement - It was not too long ago that many people looked to the U.S. for leadership and not so long ago, our nation was still thought to be a democratic nation of laws, due process, and a prudent separation of powers. Now the U.S. is reviled; Bush is seen the world over as having betrayed his own people as he wages aggressive war against a nation that even he concedes had nothing whatsoever to do with 911, a nation about which he lied in order to justify his dirty, evil little war. The war on terrorism is phony.
And now, Bush proves everything that is said about him by refusing to close Guantanamo, by refusing to end practices of torture and rendition which he denies --even as he defends them. I recommend Robert Jackson 's Place in History by Henry King Jr. An excerpt: In his final report, after he resigned as U.S. Chief Counsel for War Crimes, Jackson stated that ""[i]t is not too much to hope that this example of a full and fair hearing, and tranquil and deliberative judgment, will do something toward strengthening the process of justice in many countries. "" I believe that after fifty years it can be maintained with considerable credibility that these visions have largely come to pass. Perhaps --at the time of the writing --""these visions"" had come to pass. But thanks to the Bush administration's deliberate effort to undermine the very foundations of International Law, that important progress has been undone.
One rightly suspects Bush's motives. Even before the U.S. invasion of Iraq, before the attack on Afghanistan, Tom DeLay sponsored legislation that exempted U.S. soldiers from war crimes prosecution at the International Tribunal at the Hague. Did anyone in Congress stop to ask why? Were we planning to commit crimes for which we sought exemption from prosecution? Wasn't it clear to any thinking person what Bush was up to? Are we not the good guys? [Amendment to H.R. 1646, The Foreign Relations Authorization Act of 2001 ] 
Clearly --the Bush administration was, in fact, planning to commit war crimes but wanted to make them legal if done by the U.S. I cannot possibly hope to document in a short internet essay the various circumlocutions that have been indulged by the Bush administration and its chief apologist: Alberto Gonzales. All, however, are intended to make legal the very acts that are prohibited by Nuremberg --but only if those acts are done by Americans. Bush is at least consistent in this respect: neither would he press for trials for non-Americans. He would simply decree their imprisonment and torture. 
Nazis engaged in similar polemical campaigns. The results were tragic. So too with Bush who most certainly boasted of what can only be the summary executions of thousands who were most certainly murdered before they could assert their innocence: ...more than 3,000 suspected terrorists have been arrested in many countries. Many others have met a different fate. Let's put it this way -- they are no longer a problem to the United States and our friends and allies. 
This statement must be soberly examined; note that Bush refers to 3,000 suspects . Yet --he smirks that ""...they have met a different fate."" He boasts that ""...they are no longer a problem to the the United States..."". - Advertisement - They were only suspects . Since when does the United States summarily execute mere suspects? Do we not know who our enemies are? What were the conditions of their detention? Why are we rounding up mere ""suspects"" --and not actual combatants? How is the execution of suspects justified under any standard, any morality, any legal system? I am frankly surprised that Bush maintained the pretense when he has since arrogated unto himself the power to define terrorists. ""Terrorists"" are what Bush says they are. Bush is the judge and jury. Detainees are never charged and, by Bushs' own words, ""suspects"" are caused to be ""...no longer a problem"". Others are ""terrorists"" not because they are ""terrorists"" but because Bush --the decider --says they are. Some may be combatants. Some may be ""evil doers"". Others may be innocent. No matter. Bush --the all powerful decider --has thrown them all in the same wire cage. The same suicide factory.
Contrast Bush's remarks with those of American Supreme Court Justice Robert Jackson uttered when America still had credibility and moral authority: 
""That four great nations, flushed with victory and stung with injury stay the hand of vengeance and voluntarily submit their captive enemies to the judgment of the law is one of the most significant tributes that Power has ever paid to Reason. "" 
-- Opening Statement before the International Military Tribunal, Robert Jackson, Chief American Prosecutor, Nuremberg War Crimes Trials - Advertisement - At the end of World War II, when even Winston Churchill espoused the summary executions of Nazi war criminals and Joseph Stalin favored mere show trials, it was the United States, under the leadership of Franklin Roosevelt, that insisted upon war crimes trials. Nazis would not be summarily shot merely because they were Nazis by definition or decree. Rather, they would be given a trial. Even Nazis would be allowed the right of counsel, the right to present a defense. 
How can Bush hope to defend democracy --as he has claimed --when he subverts every Democratic principle that has been fought and died for over the last four hundred years? How can Bush justify his war of aggression against Iraq when he subverts the very ""democracy"" that he claims to bring them? How can Bush accuse anyone outside the United States of ""...just hat[ing] freedom"" when Bush is himself democracy's most insidious enemy? 
If Nazis had engaged in the same disingenuous activities with regard to the incarceration and ultimate extermination of the jews, what moral authority could the U.S. have extended if its own policies differed not a whit in principle?",1
"Part 1: Poverty and Crime: ""We can hire half the poor to kill the other half.""","License DMCA Today, no one is discussing our worst problem, growing poverty. Trump proposes Law and Order and more police in poor neighborhoods. Will more police end poverty or make it worse? How can we understand crime and its solutions without understanding its origins both historically and in terms of system? This is my attempt to come to terms with the joined evils of poverty and crime and thus form an understanding that leads to real solutions, a topic made off limits in this election. Like an infection, poverty and crime will only get worse if ignored.
German philosopher Hegel (whom Marx turned upside down) noted the ""paradox"" of poverty amidst great wealth: 
""[D]espite an excess of wealth, civil society is not wealthy enough -- i.e., its own distinct resources are not sufficient -- to prevent an excess of poverty and the formation of a rabble."" Ah, the rabble democracy: mob rule. 
Like Aristotle 2000 years earlier, he sees that ""poverty is the parent of crime."" 
Lack of wealth, in a society where people are equal, does not create crime (for it creates no motive for crime). If you look out and all live in humble shacks, that's life. Enjoy! Skyscrapers - shanghai17s jimdo page! License DMCA - Advertisement - 
But if you look up from the slums to the mansions of the rich, if you see Trump Tower looming in the distance, this produces a sense of moral outrage, anger, resentment, a desire to correct things or to do revenge. This hostility to one's circumstances in life usually leads to crimes against fellow victims of inequality. The reaction to gross inequality is rooted in a moral sense of injustice: this can be misguided into crime against fellow victims....or harnassed for revolutionary change in which the poor stop killing each other and unite to crush their oppressors, the very people arming them to kill each other. This is the awakening that Marx tried to explain.

Dakota Access versus the American Way,"opednews.com - Advertisement - 
CNN report s that protesters from around the world continue to congregate in North Dakota in solidarity with the Standing Rock Sioux and their struggle to stop construction of the Dakota Access Pipeline through (or placed so as to negatively affect) tribal lands. 
The issues and the divide between sides seem to be fairly conventional: Promises of jobs and economic growth motivate the pipeline's supporters. Its opponents cite environmental concerns (especially the prospective damage to tribal lands) and allege violations of the Fort Laramie Treaty of 1851 in Texas-based Energy Transfer Partners' wheedling of land use permissions out of federal and state governments. 
On balance, the opponents seem to have a good case; the supporters not much of a case at all. 
For more than a century and a half the US government has selectively ignored its treaties with the Standing Rock Sioux and other tribes whenever those treaties threaten to stymie the plans of corporations with friends in government. Successfully holding Washington to its word this time might give the politicians and their cronies pause next time. 
And even if letting the US government use treaties as toilet paper just because it can wasn't an incredibly corrosive idea, keep in mind that it's not just the Sioux who are getting mugged. Private land owners all along the pipeline's 1,100 mile route are feeling the pain, too. Like Keystone XL before it, ETP leverages government's power of ""eminent domain"" -- under the pretense that the pipeline is some kind of public service rather than the private for-profit enterprise it actually is -- to steal much of the land required to complete Dakota Access. 
The go-to excuse among proponents of these ""public/private partnership"" type land thefts is always ""jobs and economic development,"" but even if that excuse flew (it doesn't), it's a pretty poor one in this case. The $3.7 billion pipeline is advertised as creating a whopping 40 permanent jobs. I'm not sure how many people work at the average Wal-Mart, but it looks like more than 40 to me. How many jobs in agriculture and other sectors would Dakota Access destroy along the way? We have no way of knowing. - Advertisement - 
For me, the bottom line is this: If the only way to do something you want to do involves stealing other people's stuff, you shouldn't do it. And you certainly shouldn't get government help to do it. Dakota Access is the opposite of the American way. - Advertisement -",1
Human Rights group alarmed at extra-judicial killings of MQM workers' by para-military force in Pakistan,"(7 fans) - Advertisement - Human right groups are alarmed at the spate of deaths of the Muttahida Qaumi Movement (MQM) workers in the custody of para-military force in Karachi. The MQM has called these brutal deaths as extra-judicial killings. On September 30, Syed Abdul Naveed, a MQM worker who was killed in the custody of para-military force. According to MQM sources, Naveed was brutally and inhumanly tortured to death while in custody and his dead body was dumped by the para-military rangers in rural Sindh, area called ""Ounger"" in the District of Thatta. 24News-HD TV reported, on August 28, that a MQM worker was killed in police custody. Leader of the Opposition in the Sindh Provincial Assembly MQM's Khawaja Izhar-ul-Hassan called this terrorism by the government agencies. 
In March, MQM leader, Dr. Farooq Sattar, said that some forty MQM workers were beaten up in Central Prison in Karachi by para-military force in order to extract 'favorable' statements from them. Not surprisingly in May,Director General (DG) Rangers, Major General Bilal Akber, accepted that a deceased MQM worker, Aftab Ahmed, was tortured by Rangers in custody for 90 days. General's statement came after pictures and videos were seen doing rounds on the social media, showing the corpse of the deceased MQM worker having major torture marks across his body. In June, Muttahida Qaumi Movement (MQM) worker Waseem mysteriously died in custody at the Aziz Bhatti police station in Karachi. Waseem had been arrested by the police a few days back for allegedly possessing illegal firearms. According to DIG Police East Munir Sheikh, an FIR was filed in light of the findings of the post mortem report and all the concerned police officials have been taken into custody. Tellingly, in August, the Senate's Functional Committee on Human Rights rejected a report submitted by Sindh para-military Rangers regarding the human rights violations in Karachi Operation, declaring it ""fake and phony"". In the report, prepared by an unknown human rights organization called ""Human Rights Commission on South Asia"", Sindh Rangers were given a clean chit. Sindh Rangers has obtained a false report by a dubious NGO in a bid to convince the parliamentary body that ""it [Rangers] is not involved in human rights violations while conducting operation in Karachi"", Senator Farhatullah Babar said during the senate panel meeting. Rangers, commanded by Army Officers, are deployed in Karachi under the Anti-Terrorism Act, which provides broad powers to the Rangers and other state security forces that have facilitated serious human rights violations, according to the New York-based Human Rights Watch. Soldiers are permitted to ""shoot to kill"" after giving a warning, but are not bound by human rights standards that permit the use of lethal force only in self-defense or to protect the lives of others. They can conduct arrests and searches of property without a warrant. - Advertisement - The Rangers are a border security federal force under the Ministry of Interior, but operate under the command of the Pakistan Army. Military control over the Rangers effectively transfers key law enforcement duties in Karachi to the armed forces, which has a long record of committing human rights violations with impunity, the Human Rights Watch said. The Rangers have been implicated in serious human rights abuses, including torture and other ill-treatment of criminal suspects, extrajudicial killings, and enforced disappearances. The Rangers have been implicated in abuses across the political spectrum, Human Rights Watch said. The Human Rights Commission of Pakistan (HRCP), a nongovernmental human rights organization, has also criticized the Rangers for enforced disappearances and other violations of due process rights, and stressed ""the need for transparency in security operations."" The Human Rights Watch in its annual report pointed out that under pressure from the military leadership, the government of Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif ceded significant constitutional and decision-making authority to the armed forces in 2015, particularly in the areas of national security, foreign policy, and human rights. ""The military muzzled dissenting and critical voices in nongovernmental organizations and media. The Rangers, a paramilitary force, were given complete control over law enforcement in the city of Karachi, where there were reports of extrajudicial killings, enforced disappearances, and torture."" Shafi Burfat, exiled chairman of a nationalist group, Jeay Sindh Muttahida Mahaz (JSMM), in a statement published on his website criticized the operation against the MQM. He says: - Advertisement - ""Sindh is a permanent colony of Punjabi imperialism and Punjabi Army will savagely, brutally execute every Sindhi conscious person who stands against the occupation, oppression and aggression of Punjabi military establishment. We strongly condemn harassment, arrests, abductions, torture, enforced disappearances and extra-judicial killings of MQM activists All the bloodshed, plunder, torture, law enforcement violations are state created phenomenon created by Pakistani military,(the intelligence agency) ISI and its local stooges to exploit the resources of Sindh.""

What Was the Halloween Death Smog Disaster? And Other Scary Questions and Answers About Fluoridation,"License DMCA 
1. Why do some people object to water fluoridation? Doesn't fluoride occur in the water naturally anyway? 
The fluoride products used in water fluoridation (sodium fluoride or fluorosilicic acid) are classified as hazardous waste products of the fertilizer, aluminum, and nuclear industries. They are even more toxic than naturally-occurring fluoride, since they contain other components, such as arsenic and lead. 
However, even naturally-occurring fluoride, in areas with high concentrations (over 1 ppm) have been found to have extremely adverse health effects. Even before additional fluoride is added, the level of natural fluoride in the water in many areas in the U.S. is already equal to the amount of naturally-occurring fluoride that has been found to cause skeletal fluorosis in other countries. Studies done in India and China found skeletal fluorosis in areas containing naturally occurring fluoride as low as .07 ppm. (Gupta R, Kumar AN, Bandhu S, Gupta S. (2007) Skeletal fluorosis mimicking seronegative arthritis. Scandanavian Journal of Rheumatology 36(2):154-5.) That same amount, .07 pmm is the current amount recommended by the CDC to be added to community water supplies. 
In addition to the natural fluoride in groundwater, most people are exposed to multiple sources of fluoride (pesticides in wine and food, tea, some ceramics, anti-depressants, pollution from manufacturing, soft drinks, Teflon pans, toothpaste etc.). They presumably are being exposed to well over the equivalent of 1 ppm before any fluoride is added to the water, however no industry or government testing has ever been done to find out how much fluoride the public is absorbing from all sources. This massive exposure to fluoride did not exist in the 1950's, when fluoride was first introduced. 
2. Don't all advanced countries fluoridate their water? And hasn't it been proven that countries that do fluoridate their water have better dental health than countries that don't? 
No. Fluoridation has been almost completely abolished in Europe. Recently other countries, such as Israel and many parts of Australia, have discontinued fluoridation. Statistics gathered by the World Health Organization do not show any difference in rates of dental caries in fluoridated vs. non fluoridated countries. (WHO Collaborating Center for Education, Training, and Research in Oral Health, Malmo Univ., Sweden, 2012.) Where fluoridation has been discontinued in communities like Canada, the former East Germany, Cuba and Finland, dental decay has not increased but rather has continued to decrease (Maupome' 2001; Kunzel & Fischer, 1997, 2000; Kunzel 2000; Seppa 2000). 
In the U.S., the state of Kentucky, which has been fluoridating the longest, and has achieved almost complete fluoridation of its water supply, has the worst dental health of any state in the country. From an article appearing in the Lexington Herald Leader (10/14/2009): ""Governor Beshear said Kentucky led the nation in 2004 in terms of the number of people age 65 or older who had lost teeth. About 27 percent of Kentuckians of all ages had lost six or more teeth to decay or gum disease, compared with 18 percent in the rest of the nation."" And yet, in 2004, 99.6% of Kentucky's public water systems were providing fluoridated water to their customers. This ranked Kentucky first among all states."" (Kentucky Epidemiologic Notes and Reports, Vol. 40. No. 8, Dept. of Public Health.) - Advertisement - 
Similar results were reported in Texas: ""After 9 years and $3 million of adding fluoride, research shows tooth decay hasn't dropped among the poorest of Bexar County's children, it has only increased--up 13 percent this year."" (Conger J., 2011, San Antonio: Added to our drinking water: a chemical 'more toxic than lead? ' KENS 5 News.) 
For the best article analyzing the research on fluoridation worldwide, see the article by John Colquhoun, DDS, Phd (former Chief Dental Officer of Auckland, NZ): Why I changed my mind about water fluoridation (Perspectives in Biology and Medicine 41 29-44 1997, University of Chicago Press). Colquhoun studied the effects of fluoridation around the world, with the intention of proving how beneficial it was, but discovered, to his astonishment, that people in countries using fluoridation had the worst teeth. He then began crusading to put an end to the practice. 
Since 1990, 144 cities have rejected water fluoridation. 
3. Where did the idea of fluoridating the water come from? 
Industrialists in the aluminum and nuclear industries were under fire because of the harmful effects of the fluoride waste products being emitted from their plants--animals and people were being sickened for miles around. They hired Edward Bernays, who was the inventor of mass public relations campaigns (Bernays also happened to be the nephew of Sigmund Freud) to convince the American people that putting toxic waste in our water supply was good for us. - Advertisement - 
Bernays had organized a successful campaign, on behalf of Lucky Strike cigarettes, to convince American women that smoking was both glamorous and liberating. He hired models to pose as debutantes in a march for women's rights. When Bernays gave the signal, all the women lit up their cigarettes. Another successful propaganda campaign that he orchestrated was the overthrow of a democratically-elected government in Guatemala on behalf of the United Fruit Company. The Nazis studied and made use of Bernays' techniques for their propaganda programs. (A more in-depth discussion of Bernays' role in the campaign to convince the public to accept fluoridation can be found in the video ""The Fluoride Deception"" at youtube.com, and the book with the same name by Christopher Bryson, Seven Stories Press). 
4. OK, so maybe fluoridation hasn't been proven to be effective in improving dental health, but what harm can it do to add it to our water supply? 
First there is the cost factor. At a time when there is no money for schools, dental treatment for kids, support for the homeless and basic community services, counties are spending millions of dollars to fluoridate the water. Even worse, fluoridation has been associated with increased rates of kidney disease, Alzheimer's, bone cancer, damage to the thyroid, increased bone fractures, hyperactivity, and decreased IQ in children. (See http://www.robertgammal.com/PDFs/SciFactsFluoride.pdf .) 
Although adding hazardous waste to our water is not beneficial to anyone, it is particularly harmful to people with kidney disease (who can't excrete it properly), infants (when mixed with formula it far exceeds the safe amount of fluoride), farmworkers (already exposed to fluoride in pesticides), tea drinkers, people taking anti-depressants, people with low thyroid, and those who have chemical sensitivities. Also adversely affected would be people who drink lots of water such as diabetics, athletes, and manual laborers.",1
The Lesser of Two Evils: why Noam Chomsky is wrong in advocating this principle in the 2016 US Presidential Election,"The Lesser of Two Evils(image by Mark John Maguire) License DMCA 
It has become common in recent days, in which the 2 leading candidates for the US Presidential election have achieved unfavourable poll ratings, to regard voting for either candidate as a vote for the ""Lesser of Two Evils"" (LEV). Tempting though it may be to vote for a candidate simply in the hope of excluding another, this is a questionable ethical policy with potential risks for democracy. The ""Lesser of 2 Evils"" principle (LEV) has a long history of application in US Foreign Policy in promoting intervention in wars to exclude a ""worse evil"". So ingrained has this aspect of Realpolitik become in the US political psyche that it has become axiomatic of US public polity in the conduct of government. It has recently been promoted as such by Noam Chomsky who, in an uncharacteristically weak argument, has exhorted the left in the US to vote for Hillary Clinton. 
But Chomsky is wrong as is the political philosophy underpinning LEV which prevails as a result of its widespread acceptance in the US political Establishment and his argument exhibits many of the blind assumptions made concerning LEV. The principal area in which LEV is cited is in US Foreign Policy and a casual glance at its operation here gives a sense of the problems with it as an ethical system: Vietnam, , Afghanistan, Iraq and Libya have all been subjected to horrific bombing, invasion and military degradation by successive US governments on the basis that to do so represented the LEV. There are few today even in the US who, with the benefit of hindsight, would concur that in its application in the US Foreign Policy sphere LEV can be supported as a sound ethical principle. There are indeed, many outside of the US who would regard its support of LEV to be an evil in itself. Clearly, there are other motivations for US invasions other than LEV considerations - not least geopolitical motives - but the adherence to LEV has enabled successive US govts to conduct a programme of widespread military aggression which it would otherwise have had few means of justifying. It has come to be the primary means of justifying a brutality that is rampant in the US and which successive Presidents have subscribed to wholeheartedly with disastrous consequences for the world. 
Certainly LEV is a persuasive argument to governments facing complex issues and situations both domestically and abroad, but it is fraught with difficulties. A clear example of a sound application of LEV could be considered to be with the institution of the police force: police forces restrain liberty for the benefit of all because without them there would be a degree of lawlessness not compatible with the functioning of civilised society: it may thus be said that police forces are the LEV: a loss of liberty (evil) is incurred to avoid lawlessness (greater evil). But that brings us to the crux of the matter: LEV seems to have a reasonable application where there are 2 options and not more. If we apply it to situations were there are more than 2 options then we run into difficulty. In the case of policing it is apparent that there is no third way - or at least no-one has yet found one. LEV can therefore be safely applied in this instance. Again, in the situation where a knife-wielding madman approaching a group of school children can be disabled by running him down in a vehicle, we see an appropriate application of LEV because there seems to be no third way - and thus a great evil may be avoided by opting for a lesser evil. Were it possible to prevent the knifeman by, say, shutting the school gates, then this would remove the act of running him down from the LEV principle, because there would be 3 possibilities. If a policeman with a taser device was observed approaching then we would be in possession of a number of options: we would then have a complex moral decision to which LEV would be an unhelpful and possibly harmful remedy. That is because we would be seeking to apply a simple response to a complex problem which would potentially be detrimental and may result in a poor moral choice being made. Scaling up to the case where a conflict between the US and another country arises, there are myriad options available and by virtue of this LEV is not a good moral principle to apply. The situation in any of the recent examples of countries attacked by the US in the past 50 years has never been an either/or situation. Indeed, such situations have been subject to widespread arguments and protests concerning other options. The fact that LEV has been used to justify war, bombing, intervention etc is a testament to its misapplication rather than its wrongness as a principle per se, but given the complexity of international relations it is probably safe to regard LEV as unlikely to be applicable to most issues. 
There are also severe problems with LEV in its application in the public sphere aside from these practical considerations: 
1. By suggesting that evil can be right when it is the ""lesser evil"" it unwittingly endorses the principle of ""the end justifies the means"". This principle, which has been central to Western ethical thinking for at least 2000 years, is deeply flawed and it has - unsurprisingly - been used by many dictators as a means to justify an act, however bad, provided the ultimate outcome is good. For whom that outcome may be judged to be good, in what circumstances, by what measure and in what timescale are some of the many just criticisms of this notion of ""consequentialism"". It seems wrong intuitively for finite humans to accept such an indeterminate version of ""consequentialism"" in ethical decision making. There must be an applicability of timescale for consequences; there needs also to be a measure of the act in its intention as well as its consequence if we are to have a well balanced and sound ethical principle. By placing the matter of the ethical value of an act on the consequences alone, the intentions are effectively removed and an act is judged entirely on its outcome - it is not hard to imagine malign circumstances which have worked out well by chance. For example, if we judged a bank robbery which had gone awry by the inadvertent consequence of uncovering a stash of terrorist weapons in the bank vault, we may be pleased to have discovered the plot, but we would hardly be likely to applaud the robbers. It does seem that the consequence must, at the very least, be intended and it seems reasonable to argue that the end of a moral act cannot be the sole measure of its value - of course there is also a practical difficulty in that by the time the outcome of many acts can be weighed against the acts themselves, it is no longer of much practical use to do so! In such cases we must rely heavily on intention . 
2. LEV involves another major problem: if both options consist of evil consequences it could only be justifiable to select one on the basis that there was no other choice . If there were other choices available then it may be argued that the LEAST evil choice was the ethical option, although the introduction of a third element would cause exponential difficulties because it would introduce other considerations such as expediency, practicality and judgements concerning relative likelihood of successful outcome. Where LEV is applied to multiple choice complex situations involving moral decisions, it is therefore a crass and inappropriate response to a situation, since it simplifies and deliberately excludes other possible solutions. - Advertisement - 
3. LEV also requires heavy qualification because it is frequently used as an excuse to justify doing evil, rather than considering other options - thus in this sense it is an unethical principle when inappropriately applied. LEV must be applied to dire exigencies by its very nature for if the exigency were not urgent then action would hardly be necessary. We should also be careful to ensure that situations are properly identified as LEV situations. If we take the situation where I am in a lifeboat and there is room for only one other passenger apart from myself and there is an old man in the water and a child - which of these should I save? The other must drown. Certainly there are 2 evils present and prima facie we have a LEV situation, but on closer examination we see that there are undoubtedly other options available - I may give up my own place to them both and accept my own drowning, or I may try to accommodate both even though we may all drown and accept the increased risk of this etc. There are a number of judgements here which must be made and which affect the decision - judgements based on assumptions of what will happen; that one is more worthy of saving than the other and so forth: it is thus a complex moral decision which will require a difficult choice but is deserving of a complex consideration for that reason. Given that such decisions would be unusual in the extreme and that we would be required to act quickly rather than to sit in the boat considering the matter while both drowned, it is unlikely that the impact on the world would be great! Certainly it does not assume the great impact that LEV takes on in its application in the Public sphere where large numbers of people are affected. 
This brings us to the use of LEV in democratic elections and it proves to be as dubious in its application here as it is in its use in Foreign affairs. Representative democracy is dependent on the notion of freedom of choice so that the best candidate may be elected. Anything which inhibits this undermines that principle. LEV, by its very nature, does so: rather than promoting contest between the best in the freest manner possible, it promotes the least bad option from a narrow choice, constraining and distorting the freedom of choice of the voter. That is a denial of democratic principle; if it is applied when there are other choices available, that distortion becomes even greater so that we may justly inquire whether the limited form of democracy we possess in its representative form is worthy of the name democracy at all. We should also consider that democratic elections require myriad assumptions and judgements to be made and are not therefore susceptible (nor should they be) to evil and ""less evil"" considerations. Furthermore, b ecause ethical values are by no means clear in themselves or invested simply in one candidate or another, then such judgements made are themselves complex and deserving of such treatment. 
Noam Chomsky, with John Halle, has argued that LEV should be used in the 2016 US Presidential election and his argument is worthy of examination: Chomsky provides some general caveats by way of providing a soft-landing for his assumption of LEV and these are deeply flawed. First, to the argument that Clinton's Foreign Policy may be worse than Trump's, he advances the claim that ""following the logic through seems to require a vote for Trump""! That is an astonishing non-sequitur! It makes no such requirment and can be used simply as a means of eviscerating the claims that Clinton IS the LEV in this respect, without leading to an endorsement of Trump in the wider aspect. It may equally contribute to a decision to abstain from voting or to vote for a 3rd party. 
Second, he refers to ""The politics of moral witness"" (the argument that LEV remains evil and should not be engaged) which he counters by stating that the point of voting for LEV is to do ""Less"" evil which is an ""obvious rejoinder"". Perhaps it may seem so, but it is a ""circulus in demonstrandum"" type of fallacy to make such a criticism! It only seems right to someone who is already signed up to the notion of LEV - but to others it is simply evincing a premise as a proof of that which it seeks to confirm! 
Thirdly, Chomsky goes on to state ""The basic moral principle at stake is simple: not only must we take responsibility for our actions, but the consequences of our actions for others are a more important consideration than feeling good about ourselves"". The first proposition is good - the second half has strayed from its purpose somewhat: it appears in part to try to lessen the effect of personal responsibility by stating that consequences should be regarded as more important than intentions. That is a dangerous argument. Even at a common sense level intention is given great value in human relations - often to the detriment of consequences: and this is right, because as we have seen, consequences by their nature are often unpredictable and involve many assumptions, prejudices and involve many matters not always relevant to the decision itself. ""I will bomb Iraq because it will lead to a safer world and rid us and its people of an evil regime"" (I purposely introduce a contentious and familiar issue here) plays out like this: my intention is good, but I have introduced some assumptions which involve great leaps of faith and logic: ie, the consequence of bombing (bad) in producing a safe world (good) justifies my action. We can see very easily where such an argument goes awry in its practical and recent application in human history. It is not safe or justifiable to take arguments beyond their remit. Viewed by intention alone the decision may be seen as good or bad depending on one's point of view; by the consequences alone (deaths of many innocent people, destruction of a nation and its infrastructure) it is clearly an evil: does this imply that had the outcome of the war been good the war would have been a good one? It seems that the intention must play heavily on the judgement and a proper balance must be observed between intention and consequence in judging the action, especially as we could not possibly know the outcome. Of course we are setting aside the notion that Iraq was not a true LEV situation since there were actions which could be taken which were considerably less evil, but the example serves to demonstrate that intention and consequence cannot easily be separated in weighing the ethical value of an action. Therefore it seems fair to alter Chomsky's proposition to ""We must take responsibility for our actions which should have intrinsic good as their basis and CONSIDER the consequences as a corollary to this"". That is as far as an ethical argument can take us. - Advertisement - 
A final criticism of LEV, says Chomsky, is equating it with ""passive acquiescence to the bipartisan status quo"" and he attacks this by stating that LEV can be defended by the fact that ""poorly considered electoral decisions impose a cost"" and then goes on to give some subjective examples of Nixon's continuation of the Vietnam war. But this is unjustifiable by the same measures we have considered in applying assumptions and prejudices to previous arguments, for it can quite as easily be argued that an alternative to Nixon MIGHT have produced a different adminsitration; indeed, that it MIGHT have produced an alternative ending to the Vietnam war - but it might not: recent US history is not over-filled with instances in which different electoral results produced different policies! In the case of Vietnam it can be argued that the war was a war of the US Establishment - and surely no-one prosecuted that war with greater vigour and determination than democrat President LBJ? The difficulty with such examples is that we move into the realms of pure speculation in guessing what the alternative might have been. We could equally claim that the 1968 outcome may have averted nuclear war due to the initiation of the SALT negotiations by Nixon - but we should not do so, because to bring such unknowns which are dependent on so many different variables into the equation, takes us into the arena of pure political speculation and little else. 
Critique of Chomsky's 8-point argument: 
1) ""Voting should not be directed as a form of personal self-expression or moral judgement directed in retaliation towards major party candidates who fail to reflect our values, or of a corrupt system designed to limit choices to those acceptable to corporate elites."" 
The immediate response to this is to ask: ""Is not it a matter for my personal integrity to choose my reason for voting?"" Surely my reasons for voting (or not doing so) should be determined by my view of the system, the candidates and other matters and it should not be dictated to me that I must vote, in any circumstances, whosoever the candidates may be?"" There may be very good reasons why a voter may wish to vote for a candidate including those of moral, social or personal affinity and such reasons should be respected as legitimate - even though I may have my own personal view of why and how people should vote. It seems perfectly reasonable to vote as a means of self-expression, moral judgement or even of disapprobation towards one or more candidates and certainly as part of the calculation in making a judgement as to who to vote for. Chomsky's personal injunction here is no more than an expression of his personal preference and has no validity beyond that, evinces no proof in support of its validity and is of questionable morality.",1
"Who Will Win The Election? FBI, NSA, CIA!","License DMCA In a TV interview today I was asked, considering the new FBI revelations about Hillary's emails, who would win the election. I replied that the FBI would be the winner, that the USA's intelligence agencies would be deciding who would win-- an outrageous, traitorous situation. On Monday, I had dinner with three heroic NSA whistleblowers-- Bill Binney, Thomas Drake and Kirk WIebe-- after they'd shared the stage in a panel discussion presented at West Chester University. Whistleblowers Thomas Drake, William Binney, Kirk Wiebe and moderator/organizer West Chester professor Jana Nestlerode(image by Rob Kall) License DMCA - Advertisement - I came away with the clear conclusion that the US Intelligence community is a major threat to democracy. The whistleblowers stated that NSA tracks the signal intelligence-- phone calls, emails, credit card transactions, medical bills, automated toll payments-- for every American and for billions of people -- seven billion nodes. The intelligence agencies track every member of congress and all their family and friends. They track all the people in the White House, all the people in the Supreme court, all executives of corporations. All it takes is one brother-in-law selling drugs or hiding a criminal record to get a job and that puts a person of power in congress, the White House, wherever, at risk of coercion. That's why privacy is so important to all of us, even if we have something to hide. We can be blackmailed because we love someone who has something to hide. Remember, Ed Snowden was able to access the information. Actually, there may be thousands of private contractors-- employees of big corporations-- who have access to all or part of the massive data trove. There's even a name for one of the things they do. Remember, ""Sig-Int"" is the term used to refer to signal intelligence-- anything that can be picked up electronically. These contractors and intelligence agency officers engage in what is called ""love-Int,"" basically spying on wives and girlfriends to find out if they are cheating. The abuse of the system is dangerously, rampantly out of control. The recent disclosures of nebulous information about Hillary Clinton's emails are an outrageous, screamingly transparent effort to influence the election. There is no way to justify the timing. This is just the latest stretching beyond the boundaries by an intelligence agency leader. It has to stop. FBI head Comey should be charged with whatever laws apply which relate to using government power to unlawfully influence elections. It is clear that the FBI as well as the NSA, which surely has had all of the missing emails all along, have used their control over and selective analysis of them to influence the election. This should not have happened. It can never happen again. The presidency of the United States must not be determined by the head or heads of a spy agency. And it looks like that's what we're seeing. Whether you support Hillary Clinton, Donald Trump, Gary Johnson or Jill Stein, this process should be horrifying to you. - Advertisement -",1
The Director of the FBI Reopens the Hillary Case,"License DMCA 
Word has reached me from Washington that the FBI has reopened the Hillary case of her violation of US National Security protocols, not because of the content of the new email releases, but because voter support for Trump seems to be overwhelming, while Hillary has cancelled appearances due to inability to muster a crowd. The popular vote leaves the FBI far out on the limb for its corrupt clearance of Hillary. The agency now has to redeem itself. 
I myself do not know what precisely to think. Having been at the top of the Washington hierarchy for a quarter century, I have seen many mistaken judgments. At one time I had subpoena power over the CIA and was able to inform President Reagan that the CIA had misled him. He took note and proceeded with his policy of ending the Cold War with the Soviets. On other issues I have been mistaken, because I assumed that there was more integrity in government than actually exists. 
However, FBI director Comey did not need to reopen the case against Hillary simply because some new incriminating emails appeared. Having dismissed the other incriminating evidence, these emails could have passed unremarked. 
The problem for the FBI, which once was a trusted American institution, but no longer is, is that there is no longer any doubt that Donald Trump will win the popular vote for president of the United States. His appearances are so heavily attended that thousands are turned away by local fire/occupancy regulations. In contrast, Hillary has curtailed her appearances, because she doesn't draw more than 30 or 40 people. 
Americans are sick to death of the corrupt Clintons and the corrupt American media. The Clintons are so completely bought-and-paid-for by the Oligarchy that they were able to outspend Hollywood on their daughter's wedding, dropping $3,000,000 on the event. - Advertisement - 
Nevertheless, I don't underestimate the power of the Oligarchy. As Assistant Secretary of the US Treasury I experienced the Oligarchy's power. If I had not been backed by the President of the United States, I would have been destroyed. 
Indeed, the Oligarchy is still trying to destroy me. 
Possibly Trump, as his enemies allege, is just another fake, like Obama who misled the electorate. However, Trump attacks the Oligarchy so strongly that it is hard to believe that Trump isn't real. Trump is asking for a bullet like John F. Kennedy, like Robert Kennedy, like Martin Luther King, like George Wallace. 
In Amerika, dissidents are exterminated. 
Trump is against voting machines over which he has no control. If there are no INDEPENDENT exit polls, Trump can easily be robbed of the election, as the Texas early voting scandal indicates, with the electronic machines assigning Trump votes to Hillary. The ""glitch"" doesn't assign any Hillary votes to Trump. - Advertisement - 
My expectation is that, unless Trump's popular vote is so overwhelming, the electoral collage vote will be stolen. Because of the absence of any valid reporting by the presstitutes, I don't know what impact the orchestrated election of Hillary would have on the electorate. Possibly, Americans will break out of The Matrix and take to the streets. 
I believe that Hillary in the Oval Office would convince the Russians and the Chinese that their national survival requires a pre-emptive nuclear attack on the crazed, insane government of the United States, the complete narcissistic state that in the words of Hillary and Obama is ""the exceptional, indispensable country,"" empowered by History to impose its will on the world. This crazed American agenda is not something that Russia and China will accept. 
Here is Donald Trump speaking to Americans in words Americans have been waiting to hear. Notice that Trump doesn't need teleprompters. 
I do not agree with Trump on many issues, but the American people do. For me and for the world, the importance of Trump is the prospect of peace with Russia. Nuclear war makes every other problem irrelevant.",1

Will the Middle East totally explode? Will the pivot to Asia totally implode? Will China be ruling the world by 2025? 
Amidst so many frenetic fragments of geopolitical reality precariously shored against our ruins, the temptation is irresistible to hark back to the late, great, deconstructionist master Jean Baudrillard. During the post-mod 1980s it was hip to be Baudrillardian to the core; his America, originally published in France in 1986, should still be read today as the definitive metaphysical/geological/cultural Instagram of Exceptionalistan. 
By the late 1990s, at the end of the millennium, two years before 9/11 -- that seminal before and after event -- Baudrillard was already stressing how we live in a black market maze. Now, it's a black market paroxysm. 
Global multitudes are subjected to a black market of work -- as in the deregulation of the official market; a black market of unemployment; a black market of financial speculation; a black market of misery and poverty; a black market of sex (as in prostitution); a black market of information (as in espionage and shadow wars); a black market of weapons; and even a black market of thinking. 
Way beyond the late 20th century, in the 2010s what the West praises as liberal democracy -- actually a neoliberal diktat -- has virtually absorbed every ideological divergence, while leaving behind a heap of differences floating in some sort of trompe l'oeil effect. What's left is a widespread, noxious condition; the pre-emptive prohibition of any critical thought, which has no way to express itself other than becoming clandestine (or finding the right internet niche). - Advertisement - 
Baudrillard already knew that the concept of alter -- killed by conviviality -- does not exist in the official market. So an alter black market also sprung up, co-opted by traffickers; that's, for instance, the realm of racism, nativism and other forms of exclusion. Baudrillard already identified how a contraband alter , expressed by sects and every form of nationalism (nowadays, think about the spectrum between jihadism and extreme-right wing political parties) was bound to become more virulent in a society that is desperately intolerant, obsessed with regimentation, and totally homogenized. 
There could be so much exhilaration inbuilt in life lived in a bewildering chimera cocktail of cultures, signs, differences and values; but then came the coupling of thinking with its exact IT replica -- artificial intelligence, playing with the line of demarcation between human and non-human in the domain of thought. 
The result, previewed by Baudrillard, was the secretion of a parapolitical society -- with a sort of mafia controlling this secret form of generalized corruption (think the financial Masters of the Universe). Power is unable to fight this mafia -- and that would be, on top of it, hypocritical, because the mafia itself emanates from power. 
The end result is that what really matters today, anywhere, mostly tends to happen outside all official circuits; like in a social black market. 
Is there any information truth? - Advertisement - 
Baudrillard showed how political economy is a massive machine, producing value, producing signs of wealth, but not wealth itself. The whole media/information system -- still ruled by America -- is a massive machine producing events as signs; exchangeable value in the universal market of ideology, the star system and catastrophism. 
This abstraction of information works as in the economy -- disgorging a coded material, deciphered in advance, and negotiable in terms of models, as much as the economy disgorges products negotiable in terms of price and value. 
Since all merchandise, thanks to this abstraction of value, is exchangeable, then every event (or non-event) is also exchangeable, all replacing one another in the cultural market of information. 
And that takes us to where we live now; Trans-History, and Trans-Politics -- where events have really not happened, as they get lost in the vacuum of information (as much as the economy gets lost in the vacuum of speculation).",1

Putin-Obama trust evaporates,"License DMCA 
How did the ""growing trust"" that Russian President Vladimir Putin once said marked his ""working and personal relationship with President Obama "" change into today's deep distrust and saber-rattling? 
Their relationship reached its zenith after Mr. Putin persuaded Syria to give up its chemical weapons for verified destruction, enabling Mr. Obama at the last minute to call off, with some grace, plans to attack Syria in late summer 2013. But at an international conference in the Russian Black Sea resort of Sochi last week, Mr. Putin spoke of the ""feverish"" state of international relations and lamented: ""My personal agreements with the President of the United States have not produced results."" He complained about ""people in Washington ready to do everything possible to prevent these agreements from being implemented in practice"" and, referring to Syria, decried the lack of a ""common front against terrorism after such lengthy negotiations, enormous effort, and difficult compromises."" 
A month earlier, Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov , who chooses his words carefully, told Russian TV viewers, ""My good friend John Kerry ... is under fierce criticism from the U.S. military machine. Despite [Mr. Kerry's] assurances that the U.S. commander in chief, President Barack Obama, supported him in his contacts with Russia (he confirmed that during his meeting with President Vladimir Putin) apparently the military does not really listen to the commander in chief."" Do not chalk this up to paranoia. The U.S.-led coalition air strikes on known Syrian army positions killing scores of troops just five days into the September cease-fire -- not to mention statements at the time by the most senior U.S. generals -- were evidence enough to convince the Russians that the Pentagon was intent on scuttling meaningful cooperation with Russia. 
Relations between the U.S. and Russian presidents have now reached a nadir, and Mr. Putin has ordered his own defense ministry to throw down the gauntlet. On Oct. 6, ministry spokesman Maj. Gen. Igor Konashenkov said Russia is prepared to shoot down unidentified aircraft -- including any stealth aircraft -- over Syria, and warned ominously that Russian air defense will not have time to identify the origin of the aircraft. - Advertisement - 
It seems possible that the U.S. air force will challenge that claim in due course -- perhaps even without seeking prior permission from the White House. Last week, National Intelligence Director and former Air Force General James Clapper commented offhandedly, ""I wouldn't put it past them to shoot down an American aircraft ... if they felt it was threatening their forces on the ground."" 
Injecting additional volatility into the equation, major news outlets are playing down or ignoring Russia's warnings. Thus, Americans who depend on the corporate media can be expected to be suitably shocked by what that same media will no doubt cast as naked aggression out of the blue if Russian air defenses down a U.S. or coalition aircraft. 
Meanwhile in Europe, as NATO defense ministers met in Brussels on Wednesday, Defense Secretary Ashton Carter told reporters the U.S. is contributing ""a persistent rotational armored brigade combat team"" as a ""major sign of the U.S. commitment to strengthening deterrence here."" 
""This was a decision made by the alliance leaders in Warsaw,"" he explained, referring to NATO's July summit meeting in the Polish capital. ""The United States will lead a battalion in Poland and deploy an entire battle-ready battalion task force of approximately 900 soldiers from the 2nd Cavalry Regiment, which is based in Germany."" 
On Thursday, at the Valdai Conference in the Russian Black Sea resort of Sochi, President Putin accused the West of promoting the "" myth "" of a ""Russian military threat,"" calling this a ""profitable business that can be used to pump new money into defense budgets ... expand NATO and bring its infrastructure, military units, and arms closer to our borders."" - Advertisement - 
Myth or not, German Foreign Minister Frank-Walter Steinmeier was correct to point out last spring that military posturing on Russia's borders will bring less regional security. Mr. Steinmeier warned against ""saber-rattling ,"" adding that, ""We are well advised not to create pretexts to renew an old confrontation."" 
Speaking of such pretexts, it is high time to acknowledge that the marked increase in East-West tensions over the past two and a half years originally stemmed from the Western-sponsored coup d'e'tat in Kiev on Feb. 22, 2014, and Russia's reaction in annexing Crimea. 
Americans malnourished on the diet served up by ""mainstream"" media are blissfully unaware that two weeks before the coup, YouTube published a recording of an intercepted conversation between U.S. Assistant Secretary of State Victoria Nuland and the U.S. ambassador in Kiev, during which ""Yats"" (for Arseniy Yatsenyuk) was identified as Washington's choice to become the new prime minister of the coup government in Kiev. 
This unique set of circumstances prompted George Friedman, president of the think-tank STRATFOR, to label the putsch in Kiev on Feb. 22, 2014, ""really the most blatant coup in history.""",1
How Intellectual Property Rules Help the Rich and Hurt the Poor,"License DMCA 
There is a recurring concern in discussions about the economy that technology threatens the livelihood of large segments of the workforce. The exact mechanism varies. In one version, the robots will take all the jobs, leading to a massive surge in unemployment. A somewhat different version has the development of technology benefiting people with college and advanced degrees to the detriment of those with less education. In this story, the highly educated do well, while the less educated see stagnant or declining wages. 
While the future may actually be one of continually rising inequality, it is important to realize that technology is not the culprit. It is not the technology that determines who gets the benefits of major innovations; it is laws that govern technology, which in turn are made by politicians. Specifically, the laws on patents and intellectual property more generally will determine whether advances in technology are associated with increasing inequality or broadly shared prosperity. 
Starting with the robot story, we are supposed to be concerned that robots will replace workers in factories and warehouses. Robots can do the job better and cheaper. We will also have self-driving cars, trucks and buses. This will displace millions of additional workers and radically reduce the demand for cars. (We can summon a car to take us from point A to point B when we need it. There is no reason to have a car rusting in front of our house.) 
That's the displacement story, but suppose that robots are extremely cheap. There is no obvious reason they shouldn't be cheap. After all, we probably won't need any rare materials to make robots. And presumably robots could be mostly manufactured by other robots, so the labor involved wouldn't be expensive. In this case, we should be able to buy a robot at our local hardware store or from our favorite internet retailer for a few hundred dollars. - Advertisement - 
Once we buy the robot, we can have it clean our house, cook our food, mow our lawn and do all sorts of other tasks that we may not want to do ourselves. We can probably even save on our food budget by having the robot plant and tend a vegetable garden. If robots are doing all this work for us and we no longer need to buy and maintain a car to meet our transportation needs, we should all have a high standard of living. 
But suppose that patents and related protections keep the price of robots high. And instead of technology driving down the cost of transportation with self-driving cars to almost nothing, patent monopolies allow the top executives and shareholders of Uber or its equivalent to get very rich at the expense of the rest of the population. In that scenario, most people may not benefit to any great extent from technology. In that case, robots may take our jobs, but instead of the benefits from productivity growth being passed along in higher wages and lower prices, as was true in past decades, the benefits go to minority of well-situated individuals. 
To some extent we have already seen this story as Congress has repeatedly acted to make patent and related protections stronger and longer. In the longer category, copyright protection has been extended from 55 years to 95 years. Patent protection has been extended from 14 years from the date of issuance to 20 years from the date of application, with a wide variety of conditions allowing for further extensions. Patent protection was also extended to new areas so that it now applies to life forms, software and business methods. 
The impact of these stronger protections is most visible in the area of prescription drugs. We will spend over $430 billion in 2016 (2.3 percent of GDP) on drugs that would likely sell for 10 to 20 percent of this amount in a free market. In addition to patent protection, drug manufacturers can also now enjoy data exclusivity for test data and a wide variety of other protections that act to prevent generic competition. 
The problem associated with excessive protection of intellectual property is vividly illustrated with the Hepatitis C drug Sovaldi. This drug has a list price in the United States of $84,000 for a three-month course of treatment. A high-quality generic version is available in India for $200. Insurers and governments have struggled to come up with the money to pay for Sovaldi and, in many cases, have sought to deny treatment to patients. If Sovaldi could be purchased at its generic price, the cost of treatment would be a non-issue for those with Hepatitis C. - Advertisement - 
Those who developed and marketed Sovaldi are now getting very rich as a result of its high price. But this is not a story of technology making them rich; it is a story of government-granted patent monopolies making them rich. 
If we are bothered by the upward redistribution of income of the last four decades, we should be looking at how we support the process of innovation, not blaming robots. 
Of course we do need a mechanism to support research, innovation and creative work. But there is little evidence that the lengthening and strengthening of intellectual property protection in the last four decades has led to a faster pace of innovation. Furthermore, there are other mechanisms for financing research. We spend over $30 billion a year supporting biomedical research at the National Institutes of Health. This mostly supports basic research, but there is no reason that the funding could not be expanded with additional funds devoted explicitly to the developing and testing of new drugs. 
Most importantly, we have to understand that the incomes that people earn as a result of intellectual property protections are due to government policy. They are not the result of technology. If we are bothered by the upward redistribution of income of the last four decades, we should be looking at how we support the process of innovation, not blaming robots.",1
The FBI intervenes in the 2016 election,"License DMCA 
In an extraordinary and unprecedented action, the Federal Bureau of Investigation has stepped into the 2016 presidential campaign only 11 days before Election Day, sending a letter to Congress announcing new ""investigative steps"" related to Hillary Clinton's use of a private email server. 
The three-paragraph letter by FBI Director James Comey to eight congressional committees on Friday is remarkably vague. It states that ""in connection with an unrelated case, the FBI has learned of the existence of emails that appear to be pertinent to the investigation"" of Clinton's personal email server, which, Comey notes, he had previously told Congress was ""completed."" 
He states that he has agreed to ""allow investigators to review these emails to determine whether they contain classified information, as well as to assess their importance to our investigation."" He acknowledges that the FBI ""cannot yet assess whether or not this material may be significant."" 
The obvious question that arises is why, given the fact that the FBI has no idea whether these additional emails contain any significant information relative to the Clinton email case, the agency should make them a public issue within days of the election. Media commentators noted that the letter violates a longstanding informal FBI ban on making politically sensitive announcements within 60 days of a US election. 
Following the report of Comey's letter, the news media, citing unnamed federal law enforcement officials, said the emails in question were found on a laptop computer shared by Clinton aide Huma Abedin and her husband, former Representative Anthony Weiner. - Advertisement - 
Weiner is under FBI investigation for allegedly sending sexually explicit text messages to an underage girl. Abedin announced her separation from Weiner earlier this year after the latest episode involving Weiner and sexually explicit Internet activity became public. 
Comey's letter was hailed by Donald Trump and Republican Party spokesmen as tantamount to an official reopening of the FBI investigation and rescinding of the decision announced by Comey in July that no charges would be brought against the Democratic presidential candidate. 
Clinton spoke to the press briefly Friday evening, demanding that the FBI provide more information about the substance of what it was reviewing, including whether there was any connection to her use of a private email server. She pointed out that more than 15 million people have already voted and that many millions more will be going to the polls over the next week as early voting continues. In response to questions, she indicated that the FBI has not contacted her and that she first learned of the letter through the media. 
It is at this point impossible to determine with precision the motivation behind Comey's letter and the political forces for which he is speaking. However, his attempt to present the letter as a politically disinterested response to the discovery of new information lacks any credibility. 
This direct intervention into the election by the top police-intelligence agency can only be an expression of deep crisis and profound tensions within the American ruling class and the state. The election as a whole has been dominated by the growth of social anger and anti-establishment sentiment, yet it has ended in a contest between two right-wing representatives of the richest 1 percent who are despised by huge sections of the electorate. - Advertisement - 
It has plumbed the depths of political debasement on the part of both candidates -- the fascistic billionaire Trump seeking to channel discontent along the most right-wing, chauvinist and racist channels; the multimillionaire Clinton relying on sex scandals and a McCarthyite attack on Trump as an agent of Russian President Vladimir Putin to bury incriminating revelations of corruption and lying and to swing public opinion behind a policy of military escalation and confrontation with nuclear-armed Russia. 
The entire process has been surrounded by an aura of violence and a breakdown of public confidence in the political system. It has unfolded under conditions of deepening economic crisis, mounting international tensions and worsening crises for US imperialism around the world, i.e., the ongoing debacle of Washington's war for regime change in Syria, the signs of disarray in the anti-Chinese ""pivot to Asia,"" the emergence of open conflicts with imperialist ""allies"" in Europe, particularly Germany. 
The convergence of these crises is generating bitter conflicts within the American ruling class over policy questions, magnified by fears of a rising tide of social opposition at home. 
Whether the intention of Comey's letter was to inflict fatal damage to Clinton's candidacy, shore up endangered Republican majorities in the Senate and House, or fire a shot across the bow against an incoming Clinton administration, it makes clear that the next administration will be mired in crisis from the day it takes office.",1
"All Governments Lie, The Movie","(128 fans) - Advertisement - 
Picture, if you will, video footage of vintage (early 2016) Donald Trump buffoonery with the CEO of CBS Leslie Moonves commenting on major media's choice to give Trump vastly more air time than other candidates: ""It may not be good for America, but it's damn good for CBS."" 
That's the introduction to a powerful critique of the U.S. media. A new film screens in New York and Los Angeles this week called All Governments Lie: Truth, Deception, and the Spirit of I.F. Stone . 
The website AllGovernmentsLie.com has screening dates , a list of lies , and a list of good journalists who expose lies . The lists on the website are not identical to the content of the film, but there's a good deal of overlap -- enough to give you a sense of what this project is about. 
I'd have made various changes and additions to the film. In particular, I'm tired of all the focus on Iraq 2003. This film touches on war lies since then, but still gives that one particular set of war lies prominence. 
Still, this is a film that should be shown in cities, homes, and classrooms across the United States. It includes and is driven by Noam Chomsky's analysis of how the media system is ""rigged"" without those doing the rigging believing they've done anything at all. It's a survey of skullduggery by corporate media. It's an introduction to numerous journalists far superior to the norm. And it's an introduction to I.F. Stone. It includes footage of a presentation of the annual Izzy Award which goes to journalists acting in Stone's tradition. 
One of the lies listed in the film and on the website is that of the Gulf of Tonkin (non-)Incident. Anyone paying attention knows of it now as a war lie. And it was a transparent war lie at the time in a particular sense. That is: had the North Vietnamese really shot back at a U.S. ship off their coast, that would not have been any sort of legal, much less moral, justification for escalating a war. I'd love it if people could grasp that logic and apply it to the Black Sea, the Red Sea, and every other part of the earth today. 
But the Gulf of Tonkin lies about Vietnamese aggression against the U.S. ships innocently patrolling and firing off the coast of Vietnam were not transparent to people with faith in the U.S. role of Global Policeman. Someone had to make the lies transparent. Someone had to document that in fact the Secretary of So-Called Defense and the President were lying. Sadly, nobody did that in the first 24 hours after the Congressional committee hearings, and that was all it took for Congress to hand the president a war. 
And it was decades before White House transcripts came out and before the National Security Agency confessed, and additional years before former Secretary Robert McNamara did. Yet, those revelations simply confirmed what people paying attention knew. And they knew it because of I.F. Stone who just weeks after the (non-)incident published a four-page edition of his weekly newsletter exclusively about Tonkin. - Advertisement - 
Stone's analysis is useful in looking at the incident or lack thereof this past month in the Red Sea off Yemen. And in fact it is to Yemen that Stone immediately turned on page 1 in 1964. The United Nations, including its U.S. ambassador, had recently condemned British attacks on Yemen that Britain defended as retaliatory. President Dwight Eisenhower had also warned the French against retaliatory attacks on Tunisia. And President Lyndon Johnson, even at the time of Tonkin, Stone notes, was warning Greece and Turkey not to engage in retaliatory attacks on each other. 
Stone, who tended to look even at written laws that nobody else paid any heed to, pointed out that three of them banned these sorts of attacks: the League of Nations Covenant, the Kellogg-Briand Pact, and the U.N. Charter. The latter two are still theoretically in place for the U.S. government. 
The United States in Vietnam, Stone goes on to show, could not have been innocently attacked but itself admitted to having already sunk a number of Vietnamese boats. And indeed the U.S. ships, Stone reports, were in North Vietnamese waters and were there to assist South Vietnamese ships that were shelling two North Vietnamese islands. And in fact those ships had been supplied to South Vietnam by the U.S. military and the good old American tax payers. 
Stone did not have access to closed committee hearings, but he hardly needed it. He considered the assertions made in speeches by the only two senators who voted against the war. And then he looked for any rejoinders by the chairmen of the committees. He found their denials to be non-denials and nonsensical. It made no sense that the U.S. ships simply happened to be randomly hanging around in the vicinity of the South Vietnamese ships. Stone didn't believe it. 
Stone also filled in the background information. The United States had been supporting guerrilla attacks on North Vietnam for years prior to the non-incident. And Stone raised numerous suspicions, including the question of why the U.S. ships had supposedly made sure they were out in international waters for the (non-)incident to (not) occur, and the question of why in the world Vietnam would take on the United States military (something nobody could explain, though Eugene McCarthy proposed that perhaps they had been bored). - Advertisement -

Globalization Expressway to Universal Slavery,"License DMCA 
If humans were largely moral and ethical beings, then globalization could be a workable proposition. Unfortunately, the dark behavioral narcissism expressed by compulsive greed and an infinite appetite for power seems to have become the guiding precept of our collective nightmare. If only the desire to dominate others and have a lot more than them were not the prime motivations for the global elite on top of the human food chain, we could all have our respective modest slice of happiness on this planet. The Utopia of globalization through institutions such as the United Nations (UN), World Bank , and International Monetary Fund (IMF) was supposed to eradicate the universal pestilence of war, extreme poverty , hunger and slavery using the might of the above supranational institutions to prevent the rise of so-called rogue nations usually ruled by dictators.

World order of chaos with misery for profit 
The opportunity of this push for a supranational form of government has to be understood in the psychological context of a world traumatized by World War II. Many public servants, who had fought against the Nazis and their Japanese and Italian allies, had genuinely the best intentions at heart when institutions like the UN were set up. If some of the original ideas were good and moral to some extend, a rot almost immediately contaminated and perverted most of the created institutions and quickly -- using the pretext of the Cold War -- allowed the birth of a monstrosity such as the North Atlantic Treaty Organization ( NATO ). The globalists have controlled and ultimately Wall Street has financed, supranational government instances such as the UN, IMF, World Bank and a myriad of non-governmental organization (NGO) little helpers. Not only have these done nothing to curtail the man-made disasters of war, climate change , slavery and poverty, but they have exacerbated them, all for the sake of profit. - Advertisement - License DMCA 
In this Orwellian time of moral decay, human misery is good for business. In a globalization controlled by Wall Street's puppeteer sociopaths, who believe they are the masters of the universe, ordinary people everywhere have become canon fodder and slave labor. They are not even collateral damage but human lubricant, as viewed by the elite. One can see that if they are not stopped immediately, trade agreements like the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) and its Trans-Atlantic counterpart could seal the deal of the establishment of an atrocious world government, controlled by a few thousands, in complete disregard of not only national interest, but also cultural diversity.

Look what happened to Detroit, Michigan, and countless other manufacturing towns in the United States that are all collateral damage of Bill Clinton's North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA). The massive trade agreements in the works, to be put in place by the globalists if they remain in power, are intended to annihilate any form of economic or political independence from the signatory countries and to scatter their populations to the wind, as in the case in the globalist-controlled demolition of the Middle East in Iraq, Libya and Syria. Displaced and disenfranchised populations are beaten into submission and used as docile worker bees. (image by Mark Rain) License DMCA 
Drastic action or hell on earth 
If we let the globalists complete their worldwide coup already in progress, then all sovereignty would be lost, and most of the world's population would become slave-wage laborers at the mercy of the global corporate empire. Countries with a diversified agriculture would be turned into one-crop wastelands to ensure that most of the food supply has to be imported. Pseudo local governments would merely officiate as the slave drivers for the global elite. This must be stopped at all cost and undone by all means necessary. If we allow this final coup by the geriatric psychopaths at the top of the current world order, thousands of years of our rich human experience would be wiped out. Like poorly made cheap electronic products, the cultural garbage of the lowest common denominator empire would flood the world. This cultural homogenization would affect primarily the information available to people. Since dissent is impossible without correct information and critical thought, the globalists want their propaganda to become the only source of information. With the UN, the World Bank and the IMF, the political and economic framework financed by a worldwide network of banksters is already in place. Influential nations, on paper, like France and the United Kingdom, which are still officially full fledged members of the UN Security Council, have de facto abdicated their sovereignty to become vassals and secondary enforcers of the globalist plan. We are at the edge of an existential threat of greater magnitude than ever before in human history. (image by IMFarchive) License DMCA 
The semantics of deception 
Machiavelli is known for his cynical view of political power; however, the advice the author of The Prince gave to the powerful of his time seems innocent by comparison to the depravity of today's puppet masters. Words and ideas are gutted of their meaning to signify, most of the time, the exact opposite. For example, globalist eminence grise George Soros' Open Society Foundation is an opaque giant NGO, with more than 100 offshoots worldwide by its own admission, but its tentacles are in reality more far reaching. The recent publications of Wikileaks in the voluminous Podesta email files have been a revelation of the extent of deception victimizing United States citizens. John Podesta may be viewed as a Soros right-hand man in the US in charge of delivering the returns for the globalist's investments in the US elections. The connection between the two men is not only obvious but also official considering that Soros financed Podesta's so-called Center for American Progress, the fake left equivalent of the neocon think tanks. The term progress is a lure that signifies power, just like Soros' open society is, in reality, an exclusive club as tight as oysters reserved only for Soros' chosen associates to savor. What is apparent from the email treasure trove is that Podesta's job is really to supervise Hillary Clinton on behalf of Soros. In this context, the expression, leader of the free world, to describe the US president becomes a lie. The current world order of the globalists is anything but free, and one applicant for the job, Hillary Clinton, is not a queen on the chessboard, but a pawn.",1
A Superpower Rises: From the Implementation of Tsardom to the Congress of Vienna,"Russia , The Episodes by Julien PAOLANTONI (France) 
What follows is the continuation of series of essays “Brief History of Russia”, produced by the French political and financial analyst Julien Paolantoni. The first set was published by ORIENTAL REVIEW in January 2015 and covered the period from the IXth to the middle of XVIth century. Introduction 
Part 1 of this series was aimed at explaining the foundation of the Russian state, by discussing its early influences in the cultural and political fields. As the subject of the present part is to provide insight on how Russia reached the status of superpower, it is necessary to briefly get back to the reign of Ivan III . 
Although the reign of the tsars started officially with Ivan IV , Ivan III (“Ivan the Great”) played a critical role in the centralization of the Russian state, after having defeated the Mongol army in 1480. 
Meanwhile, the extension of the Russian land was eased by the death of Casimir IV , the king of Poland, in 1492 and the fact that Casimir’s son, Alexander, was willing to cooperate with the Russians, so he wedded Ivan’s daughter Helena soon after accessing the throne of Lithuania, as an attempt to avoid open conflict with his powerful neighbor. Unfortunately for him, Ivan III’s clear determination to appropriate as much of Lithuania as possible, finally obliged Alexander to wage war against his father-in-law in 1499. It was a complete disaster for Lithuania and in 1503 Alexander eventually purchased peace by ceding to Ivan III Novgorod-Seversky, Chernigov and seventeen other cities. 
With the unification of the state’s heartland almost complete, the country was ready to assert itself on the international stage. One figure sums up Russia’s fast expansion: from 1550 to 1700, Russia’s territory grew by 35000 km2 a year (which is approximately the size of Netherlands today). [1] 
Therefore, Russia became a superpower way before the early 19 th century, more precisely before the Concert of Europe set up by the Congress of Vienna (1815) … The Reinforcement of Tsardom 
Conventionally, the Tsardom of Russia is considered by historians as the period running from Ivan IV’s claim to be the “Ruler of all Rus’ ” in 1547 to the foundation of the Russian Empire by Peter the Great in 1721. 
Ivan IV’s coronation ceremony was modeled after those of the Bizantine emperors, and six years later Moscow became known as the Third Rome due to the takeover of Constantinople by the Ottoman Empire, leaving Moscow as the only legitimate center of the Orthodox Church. During the late 1550’s, he subordinated the Russian nobility to an unprecedented degree (a simple provocation was generally enough to get forced into exil or even executed). [2] 
OR note : the alleged “cruelty” of the reign of Ivan IV was notably exaggerated in Western historiography, basing on two very biased and controversial “sources”– prominent writing by the exiled British diplomat Jerome Horsey “ Observations in seventeen years’ travels and experience in Russia” and “ A Brief Account of the Character and Brutal Rule of Vasil’evich, Tyrant of Muscovy” , written by a vague Pomeranian mercenary Albert Schlichting. The only Russian language source of Ivan IV’s “tyrany” is a dubious chronicle composed in Novgorod the Great when the city was under Swedish rule in 1611-1617. Meanwhile the number of victims of his 37 years long reign were far l ess then of the single St.Bartholonew’s day massacre in France, when up to 30 thousand of Huguenots were assassinated during the night on Aug 24, 1572, but no one in the West dares to call Charles IX of France The Butcher… At the same time the standard title of Ivan IV in English (The Terrible) is fantastically misleading. The Russian title Грозный has absolutely different connotation in the Russian language. Translating it correctly, it should sound as The Awesome. The Terrible in Russian is “Ужасный” and no Tsar could obtain such title even theoretically. 
Nevertheless, Ivan IV is regarded as a key Russian statesman because in 1550 he promulgated a new code of laws (the Sudebnik ), introduced the self-management of rural regions, established the Zemsky Sobor , which was the first representative body on a large scale in Russian history (it happened on a local scale in Novgorod though, as mentioned in the first part of this series) and was also able to decrease the influence of the clergy on politics. [3] Ivan IV managed to annex the Khanates of Kazan in 1552, and those of Siberia and Astrakhan later but his long Livonian War for the control of the Baltic coast and access to sea trade turned out to be a costly failure. [4] Indeed, in 1558 he engaged his country in a twenty-five year war against Sweden, Denmark and the Polish Lithuanian Commonwealth, which resulted in the failure to secure a critical position in the Baltic Sea. In the meantime, Devlet I of Crimea hoped to take advantage of the difficulties of the Russian army on the Baltic front to repeatedly sack the Moscow area. This northern threat was combined with insecurity on the southern border, where the Nogai Horde pillaged the land and enslaved local inhabitants. [5] Nevertheless, these conquests enabled Ivan IV to gain access to Central Asia and to control the entire Volga River. It also brought a significant Muslim Tatar population into Russia, which officially emerged as a multiethnic and multiconfessional state, even if Russia has ever been a cosmopolite country since its foundation. 
However, Ivan IV’s hostility toward the nobility weakened his country in the short term ( according to other assessments, taking power over the greedy oligarchy by Ivan IV was the first effective act of reinforcement of the central authority in Russia, an endeavour, repeated later by Peter the Great, Stalin and Putin – OR ). In 1565, the Tsar divided Russia into two parts: the oprichnina (his private realm) made up of some of the largest and richest districts and the zemshchina (the public domain). By doing so, Ivan IV got rid of a large number of people who helped in the expansion of Russia. This process reached its climax during the “Massacre of Novgorod”, in 1570, while trade significantly decreased. The weakening of the aristocracy combined with low harvests (a lot of peasants left Russia to escape from excessively high taxes, others were killed as part of the repression), military losses and epidemics enabled the Crimean Tatars to burn down Moscow and raid central Russia in 1571. [6] Besides, the joint coalition made up of Sweden, Denmark and the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth was successful in halting Russia’s expansion for the first time of its history. 
Ivan IV’s domestic policy and foreign policy ultimately led Russia to one of the darkest ages of its history, a time of civil war and social struggle known under the name of the “ Time of Troubles ”. Time of Troubles, 1598 – 1613 
This unstable period runs from the death of Feodor Ivanovich, the last tsar of the Rurik Dynasty to the establishment of the Romanov Dynasty , which would lead the country until the Revolution of 1917. 
Between 1601 and 1601, extremely cold summers destroyed crop fields which led to famine and social unrest. They were allegedly caused by the eruption of a volcano in Peru in 1600, massively pouring out sulfur dioxide into the atmosphere, which is supposed to have resulted in the formation of sulfur acid preventing the sunlight to reach properly the Earth’s surface. 
The Polish-Lithuanian army added further turmoil in the country by carrying out several invasions during the Polish-Muscovite war (1605-1618). In 1605, they also installed an impostor on the throne of Russia: False Dmitry I , who claimed to be the legitimate son of Ivan IV. The turning point occurred at the Battle of Klushino in 1610, when the Russian-Swedish army was defeated, which enabled a group of Russian aristocrats, the Seven Boyars, to depose the tsar Vasily Shuysky , who gained power by killing False Dmitry I. The Polish prince Władysław IV Vasa became tsar and violently repressed the opposing Muscovite crowd, while another impostor, False Dmitry II , also claimed to be the rightful heir of Ivan IV but failed in his attempt to seize power. An important fact is that all the fake tsars had support from the Catholic Church, because the Polish-Lithuanian leaders wanted to convert the Russian people. Here is certainly the origin of the anti-catholic (and sometimes anti-Polish) feeling in Russia. [7] ( Not exactly – the Rome’s endeavours to bring Constantinople’s Church domains under Latin amice were permanent since the Great Schism in 1054 – OR ). Kuzma Minin and Dmitry Pozharsky 
Finally, an army led by Kuzma Minin (a merchant) and Dmitry Pozharsky (a prince from the Suzdal area) managed to crush the foreign forces and to expel them from Moscow on the 4 th of November, 1612. Pozharsky ran the provisional government of Moscow with the help of his assistant, Dmitry Trubetskoy, until a new tsar was elected by the Zemsky Sobor . [8] 
The death toll during the Time of Troubles was heavy: according to Sergey Solovyov, tens of thousands died in riots and battles. [9] This dark period was influential in the emergence of Russian nationalism, and the 4 th of November is now celebrated every year as a Unity Day (the tradition was established in 1613 by the new elected tsar, Mikhail Romanov and brought back by Vladimir Putin in 2005, because the bolshevik revolutionaries had replaced it by a day celebrating the revolution of 1917). 
The unification of the Russian society around the Romanov dynasty set the framework for the powerful Russian Empire to come. The Establishment of the Romanov Dynasty 
The first task of Mikhail Romanov was to restore peace. It was eased by the weakening of his two main enemies, Sweden and the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth due to a conflict between the two entities, which provided Russia with the opportunity to make peace with the former in 1617 and with the latter in 1619, at the price of limited territory losses. Those territories were recovered by the Treaty of Pereyaslav , signed with the Zaporozhsky Cossacks in 1654, which basically entailed the russification of Dnipro stepes known as Ukraine today, as a reward for the military support offered by the tsar Alexey I during the Khmelnytsky rebellion, in an area formerly under Polish control. [10] 
This treaty immediately sparked the Russo-Polish War, which had far reaching consequences. Indeed, it ended with the Treaty of Andrusovo (1667), whose major feature is the losses of Kiev and Smolensk for Poland, which fell under Russian control. [11] An alliance between the political elite and the nobility then resulted in a dramatic deterioration of peasants’ conditions in all of Russian-controlled territories, as they were charged taxes 100 times higher than a century ago. [12] Obviously, popular rebellions frequently took place, such as the Salt Riot (1648), the Copper Riot (1662) and the Moscow Uprising (1682). 
In 1672, Peter I, who would become known as Peter the Great, founder of the Russian Empire was born in this unstable period. In 1682, Feodor III and Peter became tsar with his mother as regent, because he was only 10-year old. He had to wait until the death of his mother in 1694 to actually exercise power (his half-sister, Sophia, managed to seize power in 1682 and ruled the nation until Peter’s mother deposed her seven years later). At this time, Russia was already the largest state in the world (three times the size of continental Europe), which would imply several challenges for the latter statesman. Foundation of the Russian Empire 
Peter I initiated the tradition of the “reforming tsar”. From his reign on, all tsars were judged on their ability to modernize the economy and Russian society as a whole, and also on their ability to gain influence abroad. The protection of the homeland was not ambitious enough anymore. [13] Following this new doctrine, Peter I’s initial military campaigns were directed against the Ottoman Empire, because he wanted to gain a foothold on the Black Sea, by taking the town of Azov. [14] 
But his attention quickly turned to the north, as Russia was denied access to the Baltic Sea by Sweden. In 1699, it led Peter I to sign a secret alliance with Russia’s main foe during the 16 th and 17 th centuries, that is to say the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth, to wage war against Sweden, also with the help of Denmark. The Great Northern War ended in 1721, when Sweden had to cede provinces situated east and south of the Gulf of Finland, thereby securing Peter I’s coveted access to the sea. In 1703, it was in this area that he founded St Petersburg, designed as a “window opened upon Europe” which was to replace Moscow as the nation’s capital from until 1918. Therefore, the conquest of the northern front was a well-prepared plan and Peter decided to assume the title of emperor as a celebration of these conquests, thus replacing the Tsardom with the Russian Empire in 1721. 
Under his reign, Russia became an absolutist state molded on the European standards of that time. Indeed, Peter the Great replaced the Boyar Duma (which was a council of nobles, not to be confused with the modern State Duma, which is the lower house of the Russian parliament; the upper house being the Federal Council of Russia) with a nine-member supreme council of state, called the Governing Senate. Its mandate was to oversee administrative, judicial and financial affairs, and its main achievement has been to collect taxes more effectively: tax revenues tripled over the course of Peter the Great’s reign. [15] 
However, in 1722 he displayed his Table of Ranks, whose aim was to determine position and status of everybody in the tree branches of the administration (the military, civil and court services) according to skills rather than according to birth or seniority. He also required state service from all the nobles. Thus, it created an educated class of noble bureaucrats who had to demonstrate their ability to carry out administrative tasks. In this regard, Russia was more developed than other absolute European monarchies, such as France. [16] Peter the Great also undertook a government reform, which officially incorporated the Orthodox Church into the administrative structure but in fact it became a tool of the emperor, as he replaced the patriarchate with the Holy Sinod (a collective entity) led by a government official. [17] 
In 1725, Peter the Great died, leaving an unsettled succession as he failed to choose the next tsar before dying (he passed a law which abrogated traditional rules of succession, based on the law of primogeniture). Obviously, the following decade was marked by various plots and coups. As a result, the critical factor to take the throne over became the support of the palace guards. The Era of Russian Palace Revolutions 
Peter the Great’s wife, Catherine I , was the first woman to ascend the throne of Russia, paving the way for a century almost completely dominated by women, including her daughter Elizabeth and Catherine the Great. Both continued Peter the Great’s policies in modernizing Russia, but Catherine I’s humble origins was considered as a state secret by later generations of tsars. [18] 
At the time of Peter’s death, the Russian army was without contest the largest in Europe. The military budget amounted to 65 % of the government yearly income but Catherine I decided to slash military expenditures because the nation was at peace. She was assisted by a Supreme Privy Council, led by Alexander Menshikov , a close friend of Peter the Great who took an active part in the Azov campaign against the Ottoman empire (1695 – 1696) but was accused of corruption (he looted Poland and defrauded the Russian government of around 100 000 rubles, a significant amount of money at that time). Another prominent member of the Council was Peter Tolstoy, an ancestor of the famous novelist, who helped Menshikov in his attempt to raise Catherine I to the throne. Andrei Osterman , was in charge of foreign affairs and was also minister of commerce, while another member of the Council, Dmitry Golitsyn advocated for a constitutional monarchy and would become much more influential later, under the reign of Peter II. Then, Catherine I’s son-in-law, Karl Friedrich, was allowed to enter the Council. [19] Catherine I 
Catherine I ordered the construction of the first bridges of St Petersburg, but because of her poor health Menshikov was the real leader of the country and he ultimately took over most of the functions of the Governing Senate. 
When she died in 1727, Peter the Great’s grandson, Peter II , was crowned tsar. But he was only 11 year old at that time so he was manipulated by Menshikov until he became severely ill and replaced as Peter II’s senior advisor by Andrei Osterman and Vasily Dolgorukov (the latter joined the Council under the reign of Peter II). Peter II died before he could marry Dolgorukov’s daughter Catherine and he didn’t name a legitimate successor, thereby throwing Russia into another succession struggle. [20] 
In 1730, Dmitry Golitsyn came up with the idea of turning Russia into a constitutional monarchy, in which the tsar’s executive power would be limited by the Council, and his constitutional project was known as “The Conditions” was signed by the new elected tsar, Anna Ioannovna . In fact, it was called “The Conditions” because she had to accept them prior to ascend the throne. The new dispositions provided that declaration of wars, international treaties, new taxes and using of public revenues were to be approved by the Council. However, Anna Ioannovna revoked her approval of the Conditions only two days after having signed, and dismantled the Council in the meantime, with a significant support from the nobles who were not close enough to a member of the Council to defend their interests. 
To strengthen her power she restored the security police and was assisted by Ernst Johann von Biron , who forced around 30 000 people into exile in Siberia, mainly Old Believers (traditional orthodox believers who didn’t approve the reform of the Orthodox Church). They also repealed Peter I’s legislation about the nobility’s state service requirements and the primogeniture law. Therefore, estates could be subdivided again and nobles were not compelled to complete the state service anymore. Besides, they further deteriorated the conditions of the serfs, who now the landlords’ permission before moving to find work elsewhere. 
From 1733 to 1736, Russia allied with Austria and took part in the War of Polish Succession against France and Spain, to prevent the election of a French candidate to the polish throne. Later, Russia and Austria waged war against the Ottoman Empire in order to gain territory in the Azov area, but the death toll was high, mainly due to diseases. This was a major war regarding Russian history because it marked the beginning of the state’s military effort to expand southward, an enterprise that would reveal successful under the reign of Catherine II. Anna Ioannovna named Ivan VI , son of Anna Leopoldovna and the Duke of Brunswick, as her successor and Biron as his regent. 
However, Peter the Great’s daughter Elizabeth seized the throne in 1741, assisted by the Preobrazhensky Regiment, an elite regiment of the Russian army formed by her father in the late 17th century, which distinguished itself during the Great Northern War. 
She reigned for twenty years and was much more effective than her immediate predecessors (the regency of Biron was marked by high taxes and other economic issues, not to mention the fact that his German origins gave Russians the feeling of losing their independence). Her reign was marked by major cultural and scientific events, such as the foundation of Moscow University (1755) and the Imperial Academy of Arts (1757), along with the emergence of Russia’s first leading scholar, Mikhail Lomonosov . She also ordered the construction of the Smolny Cathedral and the modernization of the Winter Palace in Saint Petersburg (at a cost of 2,500,000 rubles just for the Winter Palace) 
Her administration partly followed Peter I’s legacy, as they restored the Governing Senate’s powers and abolished capital punishment but also followed Elizabeth predecessors’ efforts to increase the nobility’s control over the serfs, who now needed their landlord’s approval to marry. Under a new law, nobles were also allowed to exile their serfs to Siberia. 
Regarding foreign policy, Sweden ceded the southern part of Finland located east of the river Kymmene, which became the boundary between the two states Russia ( Treaty of Abo , 1743). This success has been credited to the diplomatic skills of Alexey Bestuzhev-Ryumin , the new vice chancellor, who represented the anti-Franco-Prussian wing of her council. His aim was to bring about an alliance with England and Austria. That’s certainly why Louis XV and Frederick II of Prussia made several attempts to get rid of him, without success. Then, Russia took part in the War of Austrian Succession (1740-1748) and the Seven Years’ War from 1755 to 1762, the first one under an alliance with Austria and Great Britain against Prussia and France and the second one under an alliance with Austria and France against Prussia and Great Britain. Bestuzhev was the main Russian diplomat at the Congress of Aix-la-Chapelle (1748) which put an end the War of Austrian Succession. He managed to take Russia out of the Swedish imbroglio, enabled Russia to assert herself in Sweden, Turkey and Poland while isolating Frederick II and improving diplomatic relations between Elizabeth and the courts of London and Vienna. Alexey Bestuzhev-Ryumin 
In 1758, he got fired, without reason according to the future Catherine II : “He was relieved of all his decorations and rank, without a soul being able to reveal for what crimes or transgressions the first gentleman of the Empire was so despoiled, and sent back to his house as a prisoner.” [21] Nevertheless, the identity of his foes was well known: the French and Austrian ambassadors, but also Vice-Chancellor Mikhail Vorontsov (who also took part in the previous plot against Bestuzhev, known as the Lopukhina Conspiracy, which was designed by Jean de Lestocq, who was earlier part of the coup d’état which brought Elizabeth to the throne). 
The Seven Year’s War was rather successful for Russia but ended suddenly as a result of mounting financial difficulties and the empress’ death in 1762. Her successor, Peter III , grandson of Peter the Great, took Russia out of the war. 
Still, his reign was short and unpopular, especially within the clergy which was expropriated, while the serfs working on its lands were freed. Peter III also proclaimed religious freedom, which has been seen as a challenge to the authority of the Orthodox Church. Besides, he made huge territorial concessions to Prussia and even signed an alliance with Frederick II. Russian troops were soon deployed against Austria. This dramatic diplomatic shift led to a new balance of powers in Europe. 
Furthermore, Peter III’s national policy didn’t match at all the interests of the elite: he abolished the secret police set up by his grandfather, fought corruption within the administration and introduced public interest litigation (i.e. the possibility of conducting a lawsuit to defend the public interest). He also established the first state bank in Russia, thus rejecting the nobility’s monopoly on money creation and trade. Regarding economic policy, he supported mercantilism by forbidding the import of sugar and other products that could be found in Russia. Thereby, he carried out to some extent a westernization of Russian society. But Peter III’s wife, Catherine, took advantage of his unpopularity to set up a coup d’état against him with the help of her lover’s brother, Alexey Orlov, who murdered him in 1762. 
The new empress took the name of Catherine II and Peter’s assassination marked the end of the era of palace revolutions. The Reign of Catherine II 
The Russian Enlightenment began under the reign of Elizabeth, who the establishment of the Moscow University and the Imperial Academy of Arts. However, the movement received a significant boost under the reign of Catherine the Great . She considered herself as an enlightened despot, claiming to be especially influenced by the ideas of Montesquieu and Voltaire. She even had an extended correspondence with the latter. In this perspective, she continued the westernization of Russian society undertook by Peter III, and supported burgeoning manufactures. [22] Catherine the Great 
Catherine II’s political reforms went beyond improving Russia’s bureaucracy developed under Peter the Great, contrary to what has been said by her opponents, who claimed that her adherence to the Enlightenment was just a pretext to expand her power. 
Indeed, she established state-run primary schools, which provided basic education, exalted patriotism and innovation but most importantly, in 1767 she wrote a statement of legal principles called Nakaz (which means Instruction), clearly influenced by the ideas of the French Enlightenment, in order to replace the Sobornoye Ulozheniye , which was the legal code established in 1649 by the Zemsky Sobor under the reign of Alexey I. It proclaimed the equality of all men before the law, disapproved torture and death penalty, thus anticipating some of the issues raised by the later United States Constitution. By the way, a less known predecessor of the American Constitution has been the Corsican Constitution drafted by Pasquale Paoli in 1755, mainly inspired by the ideas of Rousseau. [23] 
Some of Catherine II’s advisors suggested creating a council to regulate legislation but this proposal was firmly rejected, and when she feared that she was beginning to lose some authority she reverted to the ways of the past: autocratic rule. Officially, she ruled with the Senate but it possessed no legislative powers. She also bolstered the grip of the nobility over the nation’s affairs. Indeed, nobles no longer had to serve the central government, as the law had required since Peter the Great’s time, and many of them received major roles in provincial governments. 
Catherine had a paradoxical thought: on the one hand she proved to have been deeply inspired by contemporary French philosophers but on the other hand she consolidated autocratism. A famous illustration of this is the treatment received by Alexander Radishchev, a social critic who was exiled to Siberia due to his pamphlet against the regime, entitled Journey from St. Petersburg to Moscow (1790). [24]. In 1773, she also crushed a major peasant uprising led by a Cossack named Pugachev, who managed to take the city of Kazan before being defeated. Operational map of the Russo-Turkish war in 1768-1774 
Regarding foreign policy, Catherine II successfully waged war against a weaker Ottoman Empire and advanced Russia’s southern boundary to the Black Sea. In 1774, the Treaty of Kuchuk-Kainarji gave the regions of Yinsdale, Kerch and parts of the Yesidan region to Russia, which also assumed military protectorship of the Crimean Khanate and became the formal protector of Orthodox Christians in the Ottoman Empire. In 1783, Catherine took control the Crimea, helping to spark another War with the Ottoman Empire four years later. In 1792, Russia expanded southward to the Dniestr river through the Treaty of Jassy , thereby annexing most of the Yesidan region. This treaty almost achieved the empress’ “Greek Project” which consisted in renewing a Byzantine Empire under Russian control, after having thrown the Ottomans out of south-eastern Europe. 
Russia also expanded westward thanks to the increasing weakness of Poland. Indeed, Catherine signed an alliance with Prussia and Austria to share the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth. Although the partitioning of Poland greatly added to Russia’s territory and prestige, it also meant a common border with both Austria and Prussia, which were two potential competitors for hegemony over Eastern and Central Europe. Moreover, the empire became more difficult to control because of a more ethnically heterogeneous population. For instance, Catholic Poles staged several uprisings against the Russian occupation, while Jews were deported to the western part of the empire, thus paving the way for anti-Jewish policies later. In 1791, the same three powers abrogated the Polish Constitution of 1791 under the pretext of fearing the emergence of radicalism, an excuse also used to acquire further territories from Poland (Russia was now in control of most of Ukraine and Belarus). This new partition led to the Kościuszko Uprising in Poland, which ended with the third partition of the country in 1795. 
By the time of her death in 1796, Catherine’s expansionist policy had definitely turned Russia into a major European power. This new role drove the Russian empire into a series of wars against the other major European force, the Napoleonic empire, which also claimed hegemony over Europe, and this had far-reaching consequences for Russia and the rest of Europe. Russia under Alexander I 
In 1812, Napoleon made a huge mistake when he declared war on Russia after an argument with the new emperor, Alexander I , who ascended the throne after the murder of his father in 1801. Unprepared for winter warfare, thousands of French troops were killed by the Russian regular army, which also received a significant help from peasants, despite all the pro-nobility policies implemented ever since the reign of Anna Ioannovna (traditional French assertions that Napoleon was defeated by the General Frost in Russia look naive but… face-saving – OR) 
After having defeated Napoleon on the eastern front, Alexander became known as the “savior of Europe” and this status enabled him to join the Congress of Vienna (1815), which was to redraw the map of Europe, on a comfortable diplomatic position. Russia was given most of the Duchy of Warsaw, called “Congress Poland”, and was also allowed to keep Finland, which it had annexed from Sweden six years ago. France and Great Britain refused the original plan advocated by Alexander I and approved by von Hardenberg, who represented Prussia, under which Prussia would trade her polish territories for Saxony. The French and British diplomats refused the deal because Poland would not serve as a buffer state between the two East-European powers anymore. [25] 
But the most important consequence of the Congress of Vienna is not even the reshaping of Europe: it opened the tradition of oligarchic diplomacy, as only five powers (Austria, Russia, Prussia, Great-Britain and France) met to discuss the future of world relations. In an important essay, Bertrand Badie showed that the international system didn’t evolve so much since 1815, the G8 and NATO having replaced the Concert in his role of Directory of the World. [26] 
Regarding domestic policy, Alexander I’s main achievement has been to bring Russia close to a constitutional monarchy, with the help of his main advisor, Mikhail Speransky . Indeed, the State Council was created in order to improve technique of legislation with the intention of making it the Second Chamber of representative legislature and the Governing Senate was reorganized as the Supreme Court of the Empire. He also introduced political responsibility to the crown for his ministers. A constitution project was stopped in 1810, due to growing resistance from the conservative nobility, especially from Nikolai Karamzin (a famous historian) and also because the Napoleonic wars became the major issue facing the Empire. Conclusion 
Part 2 of this series detailed how Russia progressively asserted herself on the international stage. Hopefully, it would have pointed out the complexity of Russian politics during the period studied. 
The country expanded dramatically, saw the implementation of various law codes quite advanced regarding the standards of the time, consolidated his nature of multicultural nation but also roughly repressed opponents to the imperial regime. 
In a nutshell, Imperial Russia relied on a combination of principles of the Enlightenment and conservative ideas, expressed by the charismatic statesmen of the Romanov Dynasty, who established the Russian identity on the global stage. The long hesitation between autocratism and a constitutional monarchy, as well as the continuous decrease of the influence of the clergy on politics in favor of the nobility are there to remind of the complex, paradoxical situation of Russian society. 
Part 3 will be dedicated to the progressive downfall of the dynasty, until its abdication in 1917, opening a new era, the one of Soviet Russia. Russian Empire at the beginning of XIX century

Last Stand For ISIS?,"Chaosistan , Iraq , Phenomenon of Terrorism By Eric MARGOLIS (USA) 
As a former soldier and war correspondent who has covered 14 conflicts, I look at all the media hoopla over tightening siege of Mosul, Iraq and shake my head. This western-organized “liberation” of Mosul is one of the bigger pieces of political-military theater that I’ve seen. 
Islamic State(IS), the defender of Mosul, is a paper tiger, blown out of all proportion by western media. IS is, as this writer has been saying for years, an armed mob made up of 20-something malcontents, religious fanatics, and modern-day anarchists. At its top is a cadre of former Iraqi Army officers with military experience. 
These former officers of Saddam Hussain are bent on revenge for the US destruction of their nation and the lynching of its late leader. But IS rank and file has no military training, little discipline, degraded communications, and ragged logistics. 
In fact, today’s Islamic State is what the Ottoman Empire used to term, ‘bashi-bazouks,” a collection of irregular cut-throats and scum of the gutter sent to punish and terrorize enemies by means of torture, rapine, looting and arson. 
What has amazed me about the faux western war against ISIS is its leisurely nature, lack of élan, and hesitancy. In my view, ISIS was mostly created by the US and its allies as a weapon to be used against Syria’s government – just as the Afghan mujahadin were used by the US and the Saudis to overthrow the Soviet-backed Afghan government. Israel tried the same tactics by helping create Hamas in Palestine and Hezbullah in Lebanon. Both were cultivated to split the PLO. 
ISIS is an ad hoc movement that wants to punish the West and the Saudis for the gross carnage they have inflicted on the Arab world. 
Western and Kudish auxiliary forces have been sitting 1.5 hours drive from Mosul and the IS town of Raqqa for over a year. Instead, western – mainly US – warplanes have been gingerly bombing around these targets in what may be an effort to convince breakaway ISIS to rejoin US-led forces fight the Damascus regime. 
Note that ISIS does not appear to have ever attacked Israel though it is playing an important role in the destruction of Syria. Some reports say Israel is providing logistic and medical support for IS. 
The siege of Mosul is being played up by western media as a heroic second Stalingrad. Don’t be fooled. IS has only 3-5,000 lightly armed fighters in Mosul and Raqqa, maybe even less. The leaders of IS are likely long gone. IS has few heavy weapons, no air cover at all, and poor communications. Its rag-tag fighters will run out of ammunitions and explosives very quickly. 
Encircling Mosul are at least 50,000 western-led soldiers, backed by heavy artillery, rocket batteries, tanks, armored vehicles and awesome air power 
The western imperial forces are composed of tough Kurdish pasha merga fighters, Iraqi army and special forces, some Syrian Kurds, Iranian ‘volunteers’ irregular forces and at least 5,000 US combat troops called “advisors”, plus small numbers of French, Canadian and British special forces. Hovering in the background are some thousands of Turkish troops, supported by armor and artillery ready to ‘liberate’ Iraq – which was once part of the Ottoman Empire. 
For the US, current military operations in Syria and Iraq are the realization of an imperialist’s fondest dream: native troops led by white officers, the model of the old British Indian Raj. Washington arms, trained, equips and financed all its native auxiliaries. 
The IS is caught in a dangerous dilemma. To be a political movement, it was delighted to control Iraq’s second largest city. But as a guerilla force, it should not have holed up in an urban area where it was highly vulnerable to concentrated air attack and being surrounded. This is what’s happening right now. 
In the mostly flat Fertile Crescent with too few trees, ground forces are totally vulnerable to air power, as the recent 1967, 1973 Israel-Arab wars and 2003 Iraq wars have shown. Dispersion and guerilla tactics are the only hope for those that lack air cover. 
IS forces would best advised to disperse across the region and continue their hit-and-run attacks. Otherwise, they risk being destroyed. But being mostly bloody-minded young fanatics, IS may not heed military logic and precedent in favor of making a last stand in the ruins of Mosul and Raqqa. 
When this happens, western leaders will compete to claim authorship of the faux crusade against the paper tiger of ISIS.

Trump warning: the start of World War III and ISIS,"Chaosistan , Phenomenon of Terrorism by Gulam ASGAR MITHA (Canada) 
The American lust for power and neo-con agendas has been causing catastrophes in the Middle East and the Muslim world now for over four decades. What is, however, a cause for greater fear is that this is leading towards a global conflict. The world just got another warning, this time from Donald Trump the US Republican Presidential candidate who has been speaking the truth though rather incoherently since he is not a politician. He has been set up by a strong establishment to ensure that Hillary Clinton wins the November 4 elections. It may seem that the Republicans did not want to host a conflict which is why they provided an opening for Trump against Hillary who will go down in history as the first US woman President. She has no qualms towing the neo-con agenda. 
Trump has now openly come out on CNN on October 26 and suggested that Hillary Clinton, when elected, will start World War 3. Why? In my opinion the best reasonings were provided by WeAreChange in a video titled ISIS: The Start of World War 3 (2014) . So here we’ve Trump who warns not only about the Great War but he is mentioning the need to focus on ISIS and not on Syria. One must remember that the seeds for the Great War were planted in 2011 in Libya first and following that in Syria under the pretext of toppling Assad. 
There are too many dots to connect but by connecting some dots chronographically, it is interesting to note a few facts. One is that ISIL (the L being Levant) drove through from Eastern Syria into Iraq stretching from Mosul to Tikrit to slightly north of Baghdad along the banks of River Euphrates for establishing the “Islamic Caliphate”. Euphrates is the eastern boundary that Israel claims is the Biblical greater Zion; the Nile being the western boundary. Two, ISIL fighters appeared in a most enigmatic manner in early 2014, very well armed. Some sources have suggested that the weapons were looted from Libyan armories stashed by NATO to topple Gaddafi in 2011 and then smuggled into Syria through Turkey a key NATO ally. On June 13, 2013 the New York Times reported that three Qatari C-17 cargo planes collected arms from Libya then returned to Al-Udeid base from where the cargo was then flown to Ankara, Turkey, along with other weapons and equipment that the Qataris had been gathering for the rebels, officials said. Sources have suggested that funding of $2-4 billion initially came from Saudi Arabia and Qatar through Turkey. 
Three, the behaviour of the “terrorists” was unbecoming of Islamic preaching or what any Muslim would condone, especially that towards women and children. Four, within one year of ISIL takeover of a large part of Iraq, the P5+1 nuclear deal was finalized as a historic achievement. 
Though US-NATO may not have directly created ISIL or ISIS, there has most definitely been suggestions that the US played a covert role with the overt objective of creating a Sunni bloc. 
With retrospect to Iran, the Supreme Leader Ayotallah Ali Khamenei had told Javed Zarif that he supports the P5+1 N-deal maintaining that Iran never had the need for a N-bomb. His reservations were about the Israeli-American interests specifically that “beneath the nuclear bowl lies a half nuclear bowl”. He suggested to Zarif to try and find out the agenda but most importantly to get the sanctions lifted. In words of many experts the Iranians got more out of the deal. The Ayatollah was probably aware of the agenda which could well be the Shia-Sunni conflict. The sanctions against Iran had failed to satisfy the US towards weakening Iran; in fact Iran has become stronger much to American chagrin. By lifting the sanctions the US has economically and politically empowered Iran and by default created a Shia bloc extending from Iran to Lebanon which includes Iraq, Syria and Yemen. 
Iran had covertly supported Hezbollah in the July 2006 conflict with Israel and now they’re again supporting Iraq to successfully oust ISIL from Iraq. Mosul is the last remaining ISIL bastion after which they might flee and regroup with Jabhat Fatal al-Sham (formerly Al-Nusra) and the Sunni coalition (including Turkey, Egypt and Arab countries) in Syria where Russia, Iran and Hezbollah might become engaged in an open conflict. 
President Obama has not supported the no-fly zone (NFZ) in his watch mentioning that the Syrian civil war is “not a conflict between the US and any party in Syria” although former US secretary of State Hillary Clinton has publicly supported the idea. In a paper published by the Washington based Institute for the Study of War (ISW) on November 4, 2015, it is mentioned that a UN sponsored NFZ resolution is desirable but not essential for US action. The ISW paper has stated that “if the US intends to lead a sustainable negotiated settlement to the Syrian Civil war or to reinvigorate the moderate rebels, establishing a NFZ is essential.”If as President, Hillary Clinton does arbitrarily institute the NFZ without a UN approval that would certainly imply the direct involvement of the US in the conflict which could well become the flashpoint for the Great War 
It might interest the reader that the founder of ISW is none other than Dr. Kimberly Kagan, wife of Dr. Frederick Kagan who is associated with the American Enterprise Institute (AEI), a Washington based conservative (neo-con) think tank and a signatory to the Project for the New American Century (PNAC). The Kagan family also include Donald, Robert (characterized as a leading neo-conservative) and Victoria Nuland, Assistant Secretary of State for European and Eurasian Affairs in which position she maneuvered the Ukrainian crisis in early 2014. Are these diplomats, including John Kerry, slated to be a strong part of Ms. Clinton’s cabinet? 
In conclusion, it is not unreasonable to forego that Trump is correct that Hillary Clinton could catalyse the Syrian civil war into a global conflict. This author’s premise and We Are Change video provides the reasoning that ISIS is the start of WW III.

Hybrid Wars 8. Strategies Against Africa – Introduction,"Africa , China , Hybrid Wars , United States By Andrew KORYBKO (USA) 
The most colonized and exploited continent in the history of the world is once more the center of global competition, albeit this time the form of rivalry between the Great Powers has taken on a much more nuanced, though no less intense, form. The US, France, and their unipolar allies want to retain Africa as their exclusive labor, market, and resource reserve for the foreseeable future, both out of their own material self-interest and with the added strategic benefit of depriving China and others of its economic fruits. Contrarily, China wants to integrate the world’s fastest growing economies and populations into the unfolding multipolar world order and give them a fair chance at succeeding in the global system. The contrast between the West’s neo-colonialism and China’s liberating sovereignty couldn’t be more crisp, and it’s this opposition of diametrically opposed global strategies and development models that sets the stage for the grand proxy battle between the US and China over Africa. 
Just as much as China needs Africa in order to maintain its steady growth rates into the foreseeable future and ensure its domestic stability, so too does the US want to ‘poach’ Africa from China in order to offset the structural sustainability of its number one rival’s global leadership. The nature of the African-wide proxy conflict is that China is ardently working to finance, construct, and connect various infrastructural projects to one another in order to create a supraregional web of intermodal transport corridors that could then perfectly complement the maritime portion of the One Belt One Road (“New Silk Road”) global vision, while the US is trying with equal fervor to seize control of key nodes along these transnational routes as well as strategically disrupt crucial portions in order to increase China’s dependence on the unipolar-influenced areas. As the ultimate last resort, however, the US, the “world island” in all the manners that it can be strategically understood as, will pull out all the stops and unleash a ‘scorched earth’ trail of Hybrid War destruction in its wake while it strategically retreats back to its self-sufficient “Fortress North America” as the final coup de grace in the African proxy war against China. 
More than likely, it won’t ever get to that dramatic of an absolute point whereby the US fully retreats from Africa or totally destroys the continent with Hybrid War, but realistically speaking, there’ll likely be a blended development of scenarios that takes place in this heated theater of competition over the coming decades that integrates elements of both extremes. China will predictably succeed in spearheading several ultra-strategic New Silk Road development corridors in Africa, while the US will probably sabotage a few others and unleash a handful of Hybrid Wars to keep the existing ways indefinitely at bay from fully actualizing their envisioned geo-economic potential. There’s no surefire way to know with absolutely certainty what the future will bring, but it’s possible to acquire an educated expectation about the structural and systemic manner in which the identified group of states will be targeted by US-provoked Hybrid Wars. Even accounting for the possibility that some of the forthcoming examined scenarios might be “naturally occurring” in that they require little if any external pressure to instigate, there’s still a strong likelihood that at least some of the investigated possibilities will eventually occur to varying extents and that the geopolitical repercussions will indisputably impact quite negatively on China and the larger multipolar world’s grand position in the New Cold War. 
This section of the book is organized in such a manner that Part I will describe Africa’s overall geopolitical situation, highlighting the influence of hegemonic and institutional regionalism (sometimes overlapping, other times not) over the continent’s affairs in order to clearly illustrate the preexisting advantages and obstacles to China’s New Silk Road vision. The subsequent chapters of the African Hybrid War research will then comprehensively examine the five separate categories of states and their pertinent neighbors that the author has already identified as being relevantly incorporated into the immediate thesis. To remind the reader about what was described in Part III of the book’s Introduction and to expand upon the earlier presented paradigmatic map in a more structurally detailed manner, the following cartographic revision will be henceforth used as the point of reference in guiding the research beyond Part I: 
Key 
* Yellow – East Africa/East African Federation 
* Blue – Central-Southern Africa 
* Black – Failed State Belt 
* Red – Lake Chad Region 
* Hashed/Thatched Lines – countries that will inevitably become involved in the targeted category states’ Hybrid War destabilization, whether as an aggressive actor, a passive victim, or a blended mix thereof. Schematic Observations 
A few comments need to be stated about the above map before commencing Part I of the African Hybrid War research: 
Southern African Cone: 
Firstly, while it’s conceptually possible for all states in Africa (or anywhere in the world, for that matter) to be afflicted by Hybrid War, keeping in accordance with the axiom that this method of warfare is more often than not applied in disrupting multipolar transnational connective infrastructure projects and/or seizing control of them, it can be surmised that the ones which could most radically revolutionize the continent’s geopolitical and geo-economic would be most actively targeted and consequently receive the highest likelihood of some sort of Hybrid War destabilization in the coming future. All of this will be described in detail in Part I, but for now it’s enough to know that the identified states lay along the paths of China’s presently constructed Silk Road routes or most probable forthcoming projects that it could pursue in achieving its grand strategic ends. 
It should be clarified at this point that the Southern African Cone was not included in the above model because its economic corridors are relatively well-established and have already been utilized for some time by all sorts of Great Powers, the West obviously included. Furthermore, concerning Namibia and Botswana’s global connectivity via South Africa, and to an extent, even Zimbabwe and Mozambique’s as well, this mostly deals with the one-way transport of natural resources and less so with each respective state’s labor and market potential. While each of these countries have a given role that they play vis-à-vis the Chinese economy, none of them except for South Africa (the hub through which most of their exports, barring Mozambique’s, pass) is integral enough to be targeted by their own Hybrid War. 
Theoretically speaking, disruptions in the regional periphery around South Africa could have a strategic effect in putting pressure on the country’s multipolar leadership and pave the way for a regime change scenario, but given the rotten nature of corrupt South African politics, it’s more expected that traditional ‘soft coup’ means such as constitutional technicalities and simple Color Revolutions (i.e. the anti-Rousseff coup in Brazil) would be used in this instance. Additionally, the resources of the population-sparse countries of Namibia and Botswana and the general market and labor potential of South Africa are already pretty much integrated into the larger global economy, so there are many existing unipolar stakeholders that would also be adversely affected by a severe disruption in or around their common point of African access. The same can’t be said so much about Zimbabwe and Mozambique, the former rich in minerals such as diamonds and platinum while the latter is poised to become one of the world’s largest LNG exporters, so it’s entirely possible that they may be targeted sometime in the future. But even so, it would be less in connection with China’s multipolar transnational connective infrastructure projects than with their own individual standalone potentials in their respective fields, thus strategically differentiating them from the other countries included in the present study (although that is not to say that Hybrid War techniques would not be used – they probably would to a large extent). 
Insular Importance: 
In relation to the above, the insular countries of Africa were also not included in the continental overview, although they too play an important role in its evolving geopolitical paradigm. Nevertheless, because they’re island nations, they’re not directly connected to anything else besides the high seas, so although they may have valuable transit node status for China as an integral component of its Sea Lines of Communication, they’re not as directly affected by the region-stretching Hybrid War study that was commenced for the mainland. Nevertheless, because each of them could play a pivotal role in influencing continental affairs if properly utilized by a partnering Great Power, it’s worthwhile to very concisely comment on how they fit into the larger strategic equation that will be described throughout this work: 
* Yellow – Canary Islands (Spain): This legacy holding allows Madrid to exert influence near the coasts of Morocco and Western Sahara, both thought to be rich with fish and possible energy resources. 
* Green – Cabo Verde (formerly Cape Verde prior to late-2013): The former Portuguese colony connects the North and South Atlantic and offers a strategic position near the mouth of the Senegal River, as well as being positioned along an important oceanic route that the US and EU must take to access West Africa. 
* Blue – São Tomé and Príncipe: Another former Portuguese colony, this one is crucially located in the hydrocarbon-rich waters of the Gulf of Guinea and in close proximity to the shoreline of Africa’s largest economy, Nigeria. 
* Violet – Comoros and the French overseas department of Mayotte: These two locations are almost on top of northern Mozambique’s LNG-prospected Rovuma Basin and thus near what will likely become a major energy exporting area in the near future. 
* Orange – Seychelles: The former UK-colonized island chain lies along the route of approach that India and China must take in accessing the burgeoning East African marketplace, and it’s for this strategically competitive reason that New Delhi has proactively sought to build a naval base and position some of its military units there in order to “contain” China. 
* Unmarked – Mauritius and the French island of Reunion: These two insular areas are not directly relevant to Africa’s mainland geopolitical order, although they do acquire significance vis-à-vis Madagascar and the US-controlled Indian Ocean bastion of Diego Garcia. 
Transregional Conflict Overspill: 
One of the most striking aspects of the reference map is that it clearly delineates the geopolitical fault lines where Hybrid War conflicts could easily become transregional: 
Out of all of the areas designated by the map, it’s most probable that the uncontrollably violent processes in the Failed State Belt of the Central African Republic (CAR) and South Sudan would be the ones to spread to other parts of Africa, at least as regards the continent’s conflicts that are presently ongoing (and not accounting for those that have yet to possibly erupt). In particular, CAR’s chaos could result in a refugee and militant overspill to Cameroon and Chad, possibly leading to these respective Christian- and Muslim-led governments supporting their own confessional sides in the country’s unresolved civil war. The misleading “Clash of Civilizations” narrative that would assuredly be purposely pushed by the Western mainstream media will be discussed later on when addressing the Failed State Belt, but at this moment it’s useful just to be aware of the transregional “infection” potential that the CAR has in affecting the Lake Chad region. Additionally, the country’s domestic difficulties could also spread southward into the northern reaches of the Central-Southern state of the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC), representing a dual destabilization threat emanating from the CAR. 
South Sudan can do something similar to the CAR in relation to the northern part of the DRC, but possibly even to the Horn of Africa state of Ethiopia and the East African state of Uganda as well. Tellingly, these latter two states are actively involved in the conflict resolution process in South Sudan and are jostling against one another for influence there in order to carve out defensive buffers (but also markets, of course) to protect themselves from this scenario. It should go without saying that South Sudan was only brought into existence because it was forcibly severed from Sudan proper over a three-decade-long civil war period, and the dynamic of anti-Khartoum action hasn’t stopped since Juba gained its independence in 2011. Therefore, South Sudan represents an even larger asymmetrical regional threat than CAR does, and their combined destabilization potential explains why they’re both categorized together as part of the Failed State Belt. 
If their respective conflicts somehow merged into a transnational conflagration, then that would represent a large-scale Hybrid War threat in the geographic heart of Africa, but the closest this has henceforth come has been the over-exaggerated threat of Joseph Kony. With reference to the Failed State Belt’s Hybrid War vulnerabilities and the transregionalization that its internal conflicts pose, it’s little wonder then that the US exploited the mystique around this warlord in order to deploy a limited but very strategic contingent of its special forces to Uganda, South Sudan, DRC, and CAR. Almost as an afterthought but drawing on the tangent of transregional conflict overlap, it’s topically pertinent to recall the Darfur Conflict and how this essentially was a proxy competition between the Lake Chad regional state of Chad and the extended Failed State Belt and somewhat Gulf-influenced state of Sudan. It’s no longer as relevant of a geopolitical item as it once was during the mid-2000s, but it nevertheless still has the potential to re-erupt in the future, especially if the externally directed Sudanese dissolution process speeds up and makes headway in the states of Blue Nile and South Kordofan. 
Lastly, there’s the realistic possibility that the US’ attempts to instigate a Hybrid War in Burundi could set off a chain reaction of destabilization in the eastern DRC, Rwanda (and by extent, possibly up to Uganda), and western Tanzania, thereby making this geographically tiny state a disproportionately large trigger in upsetting the regional balance. Although there’s not yet an active conflict in Burundi anywhere on par with the scale of what’s been raging in the CAR and South Sudan over the past couple of years, this doesn’t mean that one can’t quickly develop if the entire state collapses under Hybrid War pressure, and this disturbing scenario will certainly be explored more at length later on in the work. 
Mapping out the expected transregional conflict overspill zones in Africa, one can unmistakably see that it’s the entire Upper-Central (Failed State Belt) and the eastern portion of the Central-Southern zones of Africa that are most at risk of this destructive process unfolding. Accordingly, this realization leads one to conclude that the DRC and the areas immediately abutting it provide the most fertile ground for the transnationalization of domestic conflicts, which somewhat (but not totally) explains why the Second Congo War eventually came to involve states located far away from the actual battlespace and be nicknamed “ Africa’s World War ”. To put it another way, the Hybrid War vulnerabilities of the identified area combined with its obvious geostrategic centrality to the African continent makes it doubly capable of sucking countless states into a literal Black Hole of Chaos that could easily become the ultimate proxy war climax between the US and China.

What’s at stake in the US election?,"United States By ORIENTAL REVIEW 
The outcome of the 2016 presidential election will show that the American political system – as we have known it – will apparently cease to exist. Trump is nothing like those Republican pawns who, along with the puppets of the Democratic party, have spent the last 40 years erecting the facade of American democracy. It really looks like he is ready to make good on the threat he made even prior to the Republican National Convention – to send millions of his supporters into the streets. 
Today Trump represents an entirely new party made up of half of the American electorate, and they are ready for action. And whatever the eventual political structure of this new model, this is what is shaping America’s present reality. Moreover, this does not seem like such a unique situation. It rather appears to be the final chapter of some ancient story, in which the convoluted plotlines finally take shape and find resolution. 
The circumstances are increasingly reminiscent of 1860, when Lincoln’s election so enraged the South that those states began agitating for secession. Trump is today symbolic of a very real American tradition that during the Civil War (1860-1865) ran headlong into American revolutionary liberalism for the first time. 
Right up until World War I traditional American conservatism wore the guise of “isolationism.” Prior to WWII it was known as “non-interventionism.” Afterward, that movement attempted to use Sen. Joseph McCarthy to battle the left-liberal stranglehold. And in the 1960s it became the primary target of the “counter-cultural revolution.” Richard Nixon 
Its last bastion was Richard Nixon , whose fall was the result of an unprecedented attack from the left-liberal press in 1974. And this is perhaps the example against which we should compare the present-day Trump and his current fight. 
And by the way, the crimes of Hillary Clinton, who has failed to protect state secrets and has repeatedly been caught lying under oath, clearly outweigh the notorious Watergate scandal that led to Nixon’s forced resignation under threat of impeachment. But the liberal American media remains silent, as if nothing has happened. 
By all indications it is clear that we are standing before a truly epochal moment. But before turning to the future that might await us, let’s take a quick glance at the history of conflict between revolutionary liberalism and traditional white conservatism in the US. *** 
Immediately after WWII, an attack on two fronts was launched by the party of “expansionism” (we’ll call it that). The Soviet Union and Communism were designated the number one enemy. Enemy number two (with less hype) was traditional American conservatism. The war against traditional “Americanism” was waged by several intellectual fringe groups simultaneously. 
The country’s cultural and intellectual life was under the absolute control of a group known as the “ New York Intellectuals .” Literary criticism as well as all other aspects of the nation’s literary life was in the hands of this small group of literary curators who had emerged from the milieu of a Trotskyist-communist magazine known as the Partisan Review ( PR ). No one could become a professional writer in the America of the 1950s and 1960s without being carefully screened by this sect. 
The foundational tenets of American political philosophy and sociology were composed by militants from the Frankfurt School , which had been established during the interwar period in Weimar Germany and which moved to the US after the National Socialists took power. Here, retraining their sights from communist to liberal, they set out to design a “theory of totalitarianism” in addition to their concept of an “authoritarian personality” – both hostile to “democracy.” Max Shachtman 
The “New York Intellectuals” and representatives of the Frankfurt School became friends, and Hannah Arendt , for example, was an authoritative representative of both sects. This is where future neocons (Norman Podhoretz, Eliot A. Cohen, and Irving Kristol) gained their experience. The former leader of the Trotskyist Fourth International and godfather of the neocons, Max Shachtman , held a place of honor in the “family of intellectuals.” 
The anthropological school of Franz Boas and Freudianism reigned over the worlds of psychology and sociology at that time. The Boasian approach in psychology argued that genetic, national, and racial differences between individuals were of no importance (thus the concepts of “national culture” and “national community” were meaningless). 
Psychoanalysis also became fashionable, which primarily aimed to supplant traditional church institutions and become a type of quasi-religion for the middle class. 
The common denominator linking all these movements was anti-fascism . Did something look fishy in this? But the problem was that the traditional values of the nation, state, and family were all labeled “fascist.” From this standpoint, any white Christian man aware of his cultural and national identity was potentially a “fascist.” 
Kevin MacDonald, a professor of psychology at California State University, analyzed in detail the seizure of America’s cultural, political, and mental landscape by these “liberal sects” in his brilliant book The Culture of Critique , writing: 
“The New York Intellectuals, for example, developed ties with elite universities, particularly Harvard, Columbia, the University of Chicago, and the University of California-Berkeley, while psychoanalysis and anthropology became well entrenched throughout academia. 
“The moral and intellectual elite established by these movements dominated intellectual discourse during a critical period after World War II and leading into the countercultural revolution of the 1960s.” 
It was precisely this intellectual milieu that spawned the countercultural revolution of the 1960s. 
Riding the wave of these sentiments, the new Immigration and Nationality Act was passed in 1965, encouraging this phenomenon and facilitating the integration of immigrants into US society. The architects of the law wanted to use the celebrated melting pot to “dilute” the “potentially fascist” descendants of European immigrants by making use of new ethno-cultural elements. 
The 60s revolution opened the door to the American political establishment to representatives from both wings of the expansionist “party” – the neo-liberals and the neo-conservatives. 
Besieged by the left-liberal press in 1974, Richard Nixon resigned under threat of impeachment. In the same year the US Congress passed the Jackson-Vanik Amendment (drafted by Richard Perle ), which emerged as a symbol of the country’s “new political agenda” – economic war against the Soviet Union using sanctions and boycotts. 
At that same time the “hippie generation” was joining the Democratic Party on the coattails of Senator George McGovern’s campaign . And that was when Bill Clinton’s smiling countenance first emerged on the US political horizon. 
And the future neo-conservatives (at that time still disciples of the Democratic hawk Henry “Scoop” Jackson) began to slowly edge in the direction of the Republicans. «If there is any doubt about the power of your ideas, just look at the number of members of the Center that have been appointed to posts in this administration -especially in the Department of Defense- to dispel that doubt». Donald Rumsfeld, Secretary of Defense, September 5, 2002 
In 1976, Mr. Rumsfeld and his fellow neo-conservatives resurrected the Committee on the Present Danger , an inter-party club for political hawks whose goal became the launch of an all-out propaganda war against the USSR. 
Former Trotskyists and followers of Max Shachtman (Kristol, Podhoretz, and Jeane Kirkpatrick) and advisers to Sen. Henry Jackson (Paul Wolfowitz, Perle, Elliott Abrams, Charles Horner, and Douglas Feith) joined Donald Rumsfeld, Dick Cheney, and other “Christian” politicians with the intention of launching a “campaign to transform the world.” 
This is where the neocons’ “nonpartisan ideology” originated. And eventually today’s “inalterable US government” hatched from this egg. 
American politics began to acquire its current shape during the Reagan era. In economics this was seen in the policy of neoliberalism (politics waged in the interests of big financial capital) and in foreign policy – in a strategy consisting of “holy war against the forces of evil.” The Nixon-Kissinger tradition of foreign policy (which viewed the Soviet Union and China as a normal countries with which is essential to find common ground) was entirely abandoned. 
The collapse of the USSR was a sign of the onset of the final phase of the “neocon revolution.” At that point their protégé, Francis Fukuyama, announced the “end of history.” *** 
As the years passed, the influence of the neo-conservatives (in politics) and neoliberals (in economics) only expanded. Through all manner of committees, foundations, “think tanks,” etc., the students of Milton Friedman and Leo Strauss (from the departments of economics and political science at the University of Chicago) penetrated ever more deeply into the inner workings of the Washington power machine. The apotheosis of this expansion was the presidency of George W. Bush, during which the neocons, having seized the primary instruments of power in the White House, were able to plunge the country into the folly of a war in the Middle East. 
By the end of the Bush presidency this clique was the object of universal hatred throughout the US. That’s why the middle-ground, innocuous figure of Barack Obama, a Democrat, was able to move into the White House for the next eight years. The neocons stepped down from their central rostrums of power and returned to their “influential committees.” It is likely that this election was intended to facilitate the triumphant return of the neoconservative-neoliberal paradigm all wrapped up in “new packaging.” For various reasons, the decision was made to assign this role to Hillary Clinton. But it seems that at the most critical moment the flimsy packaging ripped open … 
What happened? Why is this clique’s triumphant return to power erupting in massive scandal this time around? Probably because we are living in an era during which much that was mysterious is suddenly becoming clear. Probably because Trump’s “silent majority” suddenly saw before them someone they had been waiting for for a long time – a man ready to defend their interests. 
Perhaps also it is because the middle class is choking on its growing exasperation with the “elite caste” occupying its native country. And it finally became clear to the sober-minded American patriots in law enforcement that the return to power of the people responsible for the current global chaos could be a big threat to the US and rest of the world. Because, in the end, everyone has children and no one wants a new world war. 
How will this new conservative revolt against the elite end? Will Trump manage to “drain the swamp of Washington, DC” as he has promised, or he will end up as the system’s next victim? Very soon we can finally get an answer to these questions. RELATED POSTS",1
Hybrid Wars 8. Strategies Against Africa (1A),"Africa , Hybrid Wars By Andrew KORYBKO (USA) 
The introductory text prefaced the general concepts that the author will be extrapolating on further in the research, and now that the basics of the overall analytical foundation and the contours of the reference map are out of the way, it’s time to begin exploring the influence of hegemonic and institutional regionalism on African geopolitics, widely investigating the asymmetrical threats endemic to each area, and start elucidating China’s overall Silk Road vision for the continent. 
African Regions, Their Respective (And Prospective) Leaders, And Interregional Conflict Scenarios 
The author’s preferred method of explaining Africa’s geopolitics is to begin as broadly as possible and then gradually become more specific, with the entire continuum of study eventually leading to the reader’s solid understanding of China’s visionary plans. To start off, it’s necessary to divide Africa into five separate regions and identify the state within each which holds the most influential demographic, economic, and military sway (cumulatively described as leadership) and has the most promising long-term potential (operative word) to become a regional heavyweight if it isn’t one already: 
* Brown – North Africa – Egypt * Orange – Horn And East Africa – Ethiopia * Blue – Central-South Africa – Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) * Red – Southern Cone – South Africa 
Interpretation: 
It should immediately be said that the above map is a conceptualized representation that includes both current and prospective realities (the latter in reference to the DRC), and that the shaded areas are rough estimates of the approximate spread of each region. There are certainly limits to each identified core country’s influence and it’s predicted that there will obviously be competitive coalitions both within its own sphere and outside of it that assemble to challenge the given state’s leadership over the said region. For example, this can currently be seen by the former French colonies of West Africa having their own Paris-controlled currency and collectively viewing Nigeria’s regional ascendency with suspicion, which has been particularly evident when it comes to Chad and its uninvited (but unopposed) anti-terrorist military involvement in northeastern Nigeria. While admittedly imperfect in certain respects, the simplified map does present a relatively accurate snapshot of the broader geopolitical processes that are presently underway in Africa and allows observers to relatively accurately extrapolate on their predicted trajectory. Therefore, the map should only be seen as a basic working model through which the reader can acquire a generalized idea about the continent and a prism of perspective through which they can thus interpret the rest of the unfolding Hybrid War analysis. 
Focal Points Of Overlap: 
The introduction spoke about some of the overlap potential between the earlier-identified regions of Hybrid War study, but seeing as how the most recent map is somewhat different in categorizing the entire continent into geographic blocs, it’s necessary to succinctly touch upon some of the areas of overlap that may not have been addressed previously. 
North-Central Nexus: 
This tinderbox of a locale is defined as the convergence area between Chad, the Central African Republic (CAR), Sudan, and South Sudan, and it’s marked by an array of interlinked involvement between state and non-state actors in each other’s affairs. Chad and Sudan had earlier vied for influence in the latter’s region of Darfur, and N’djamena also exerts influence in the Muslim reaches of Northern CAR. Khartoum is involved in a back-and-forth proxy war with Juba along their shared frontier which sees both sides supporting a mix of non-state rebel actors (some of which are defined by the respective targeted governments as terrorists), and the globally notorious non-state bogeyman of Joseph Kony and his Lord’s Resistance Army operates between CAR and South Sudan. The below map conceptualizes the dangerous interplay between forces in this totally destabilized region and shows how the only missing factors are the ‘geographic diagonal’ involvement of Chad in South Sudan and Sudan in CAR, and a possibly disruptive humanitarian/militant influence emanating from CAR to Chad (which is not unlikely if confessional tensions spike once more): 
Mountain Mayhem: 
The next most conflict-prone area of regional overlap is the mountainous area that straddles the DRC and Uganda, Rwandan, and Burundian borders. After the end of the Second Congo War (“Africa’s World War”), Ugandan and Rwandan pro- and anti-government militia groups ended up controlling this part of the DRC and seizing the profitable mining deposits located here. There’s a lot of legal and illegal cross-border traffic between the two sides, and it’s well known that conflicts from one part of the mountains could easily spill over to the other due to the well-established economic and demographic connections that link them. Burundi figures into the equation because it’s the ‘weak man of East Africa’, a recent civil war state that is now being pushed back to the brink as part of the US’ Hybrid War agenda against China (which will be addressed in full later on at the appropriate section). Destabilization in this country could easily move west and north to DRC and Rwanda, creating a tri-state ethno-regional conflagration that would inevitable come to involve Uganda as well. 
For the time being, though, dominant influence between the two identified African regions is pretty one-sided, with Rwanda and Uganda exerting control over the DRC and not the other way around. This is primarily due to their respective nationals and affiliated militias (both pro- and anti-government ones) creating a sort of ‘strategic depth’ that has profoundly penetrated just about all levels of life in the eastern DRC. However, if the DRC ever got back on track after being spectacularly sidelined by the West’s covert war against it in the early 1960s and further weakened by the First and Second Congo Wars, then it’s foreseeable that the cross-border flow of influence could either be equalized or even reversed if the right demographic factors were leveraged under the proper geopolitical conditions. 
Regardless of the ‘positive’ movement of influence in either direction, if cross-border Hybrid War triggers are activated, then it’s likely that the general destabilization could also involve Tanzania and possibly even Zambia. The last possibility is more likely so if a renewed Katanga separatist or anti-government campaign is ever launched within the region, which might pan out to be the case if popular former governor and “ opposition ” leader Moisi Katumbi stirs the pot of regionalism should President Kabila run for what would at this point be an unconstitutional third term , delays the elections, or is accused (whether rightfully or wrongfully) of committing voter fraud that helps him or a hand-picked political successor win at the polls. 
Sahara Terror: 
The next interregional conflict overlap in Africa deals with terrorist groups in the Sahara, in particular the interplay between transnational militant organizations operating in the broad expanse between Mali, Mauritania, Algeria, Niger, and Libya. The NATO War on Libya destroyed the most prosperous and stable state in Africa and was the catalyst for destabilizing the rest of the aforementioned states ‘downstream’ via the newly opened weapon and militant channel that was created in the former Jamahiriya. This wide space is sparsely populated but is rich in oil, natural gas, and uranium deposits. For this reason, Sahara terrorism directly affects the global commodities trade and the interests of certain Great Powers and their most prominent transnational corporations. 
As a fitting example, France’s nuclear leader Areva controls uranium mines in Niger, and the in-country French military contingent there is also tasked with protecting them, among its other responsibilities. Furthermore, the mixture of destabilization in the region, low energy prices, and rapid LNG industry developments have led to the indefinite shelving of the tentative proposal for a Trans-Saharan gas pipeline from Nigeria to southern Europe via Niger and Algeria, but this idea nonetheless still remains a possibility that might one day be revived . 
Widening the interregional scope of the Libyan-originated destabilization that is now plaguing the Sahara, the terrorist hijacking of the Tuareg’s 2011-2012 “Azawad” self-determination movement in Mali has also led to a spillover effect of Islamic/Salafist violence in Burkina Faso and the Ivory Coast , non-Sahara countries which are part of the greater West African region. Therefore, the two launching pads of inter- and intra-regional destabilization can be identified as Libya and Mali, with the latter becoming totally unbalanced only after the former’s collapse following the US-led NATO war against it. 
Malawi In The Middle: 
Formerly part of the British Empire and administered together with Zambia and Zimbabwe as a member of the “Central African Federation” in the closing days of colonialism, Malawi is categorized as part of the Southern Cone sphere of regional influence because most of its international trade runs through Mozambique. The landlocked country is one of the world’s poorest and least-developed nations, and the state’s dire poverty has created a situation where anti-government sentiment can be easily manipulated. 
While Malawi isn’t directly a part of China’s larger integrated Silk Road network in Africa, the two countries have quickly moved closer to one another economically over the past couple of years after the African state disowned its prior decades-long relationship with Taiwan, thus raising the covert consternation of the US and pushing Washington to order its top diplomat in the country to prepare for a coup and possible Hybrid War attempt. 
Malawi’s geopolitical position is such that any large-scale destabilization within the country’s borders could easily spread to Mozambique, but most important for the research’s focus, it could also just as likely move northwards to Zambia and Tanzania, two pivotal countries that are involved in China’s transcontinental Silk Road projects. Because of the conflict overspill potential that a seemingly tiny and assumedly geopolitically irrelevant state like Malawi can have, it’s accurate to label it a “Second Burundi” in terms of the chances that it could be used to trigger a regional conflagration that could subsequently offset China’s integrative vision for the continent. 
If timed to coincide with a Hybrid War in Burundi, then a prospectively planned one in Malawi would deal double a dose of destabilization to Tanzania and could be used to spark a larger transregional conflict zone between Uganda and Mozambique. 
Furthermore, there exists the potential (which will be discussed at a future point in the research) that this could either trigger the renewed Katanga secessionist crisis or anti-government movement that was mentioned before or be timed to coincide with it in its own right during the elections that are tentatively forecast for late 2016. If this scenario eventuates, then the simultaneously exploding series of latent conflicts would certainly spell the end for all of China’s transcontinental integrative plans, although it might still be possible to salvage the ones dealing only with East African coast (and which will also be described later on in detail). 
The Real African World War: 
The nightmare scenario that could one day transpire in Africa is if the super- and sub-equatorial active and potential conflict zones find a way to interlink with one another and turn the whole continent into a massive Hybrid War battleground. While somewhat far-fetched at the moment and tactically hindered by the DRC’s jungled geographic ‘firewall’, if another ‘African World War’ takes place in the Congo, then the resultant destabilization could be enough to surmount this physical difficulty and summon a Black Hole of Chaos that sparks a real “African World War’ which ends up connecting the Saharan-based terrorists with the Lake Malawi militants. This could most realistically be achieved via an outbreak of large-scale turmoil in the Nigerien-Chadian buffer zone and the Zambia-Tanzania-Katanga Province New Silk Road infrastructural nexus. Non-African Foreign Military Bases 
Keeping with the present security theme, non-African foreign militaries have left a remarkable footprint on the continent. For the most part, it’s primarily the US and France that have spread their units far and wide, although Washington “officially” claims that it only has a single military facility in Djibouti. Despite the technical ‘legalese’ of the Pentagon’s pronouncements, investigative journalist Nick Turse has unearthed piles of evidence proving that drone bases, logistics hubs, and other covert warfare-facilitating outposts are surreptitiously being utilized all across Africa. The reader is strongly encouraged to read this author’s works and become familiar with his findings, as they detail the contours of the shadow war that the US has been waging on Africa ever since 9/11. To summarize the US role in Africa in the most concisely pertinent way, the Pentagon regularly conducts training exercises with almost every single African military in one capacity or another, and it keeps a more lasting presence in the contiguous Sahara-Sahel-jungled area that stretches from the Atlantic to the Indian Ocean and has been called “ The New Spice Route ”. As taken from the last hyperlinked source, here’s a map displaying how this network, which has also been nicknamed “the hippo trench”, looks from a continental perspective, but it should be kept in mind that Ethiopia is no longer a formal part of this arrangement after it asked the US to remove its drone base in early 2016 in the months following the original article’s publication: 
The other military power most actively involved in Africa is France, which had earlier colonized a large chunk of the continent in the late-19 th and early-20 th centuries. The most active part of its force is deployed in the Sahel region as part of “ Operation Barkhane ” which stretches across what has been referred to as the “G5 Sahel” countries of Mauritania, Mali, Burkina Faso, Niger, and Chad. In addition to this, Paris also keeps troops in Senegal, Ivory Coast, Gabon, Central African Republic (CAR), and Djibouti. Here’s what France’s military deployments look like when they’re mapped out: 
* Red: G5 Sahel * Pink all others 
Comparing the two maps, it’s possible to observe a military overlap between the US and France in Senegal, Mali, Burkina Faso, Niger, Chad, CAR, and Djibouti: 
While most of the double concentration of foreign military bases lies in Western and Central Africa, the fact that this is also present in Djibouti mustn’t be overlooked. In fact, the miniscule East African nation has a disproportionate military significance in that it concurrently hosts American, French, Japanese , Chinese , and soon even Saudi bases, making it by far a global military anomaly in this regard. With the focus now on East Africa, it’s timely to state that this part of the continent beyond Djibouti is also becoming heavily militarized by foreign forces as well. The UAE is suspected of having a naval base in Eritrea and is purportedly prospecting for facilities in Somalia’s autonomous breakaway region of Somaliland, while Turkey is also building a military base in the civil war-torn country. On top of all of this, Qatar maintains a small amount of “peacekeepers” in both Eritrea and Djibouti ever since 2010 as part of its UN-related responsibility in supposedly “mediating” between the two asides after a tense border dispute in 2008. This strategic concentration of forces has the effect of creating the perception that landlocked yet economically promising Ethiopia is being encircled, especially by the GCC-member states of Saudi Arabia, Qatar, and the UAE, which will be an important fact that will be returned to later on when the research addresses the Horn of Africa region. 
* Red: Horn of Africa states with foreign military bases * Orange: Ethiopia African Military Blocs 
Although there’s a diversified non-African military presence all throughout the continent, Africa has still been able to assemble a loose network of regional military-security blocs that operate under the nominal aegis of the African Union (AU). The African Standby Forces , as they’re known, are divided according to Regional Economic Communities (RECs) and Regions and given defined areas of responsibility. The economic boundaries of most of these geographic blocs overlap with their military ones and will be described more in the next section, but for the time being, here’s what the AU’s allocation looks like: 
* Brown: North Africa Regional Capability * Yellow: ECOWAS * Purple: Economic Community of Central African States (ECCAS) * Orange: East African Standby Force (EASF) * Red: Southern African Development Community (SADC) 
NOTE: South Sudan is not yet a full member of the East African Standby Force, while Angola and Burundi are listed as having dual responsibilities within their shared ECCAS and SADC and the EASF, respectively. Additionally, it’s important to point out that the East African Community is divided between South Sudan, Kenya, Uganda, Rwanda, and Burundi’s commitment to the EASF, Burundi’s additional responsibilities to the ECCAS, and Tanzania’s incorporation into the SADC zone of responsibility. Also, because Morocco is not part of the AU as per the Western Sahara dispute, it’s not party to the African Standby Forces agreement in any capacity. 
The last thing that’s important to point out about Africa’s military blocs is that Nigeria, Niger, Cameroon, and Chad have aligned their forces to battle the Boko Haram threat that afflicts their shared Lake Chad basin. Documenting this on a map, it superficially looks like a formidable military alliance, but it’s actually a poorly coordinated and internally competing force dominated by mutually suspicious Nigeria and Chad:

Trump: Time To Dream Big,"United States By Marcus GODWYN (UK) 
“Well! Whoever would ever have thought it?” These were apparently John Major’s first words to his new Cabinet as he sat down for the first time as British Prime Minister having , together with most of that Cabinet ousted democratically elected, three time Prime Minister, Margaret Thatcher in an undemocratic, Conservative Party, palace coup. This was not only a cowardly and underhand stab in the back for Mrs Thatcher but for British democracy itself as under normal circumstances, and the circumstances were normal, only the British electorate at the ballot box should have the right to oust a siting Prime Minister or government. Indeed it had begun to look as if this was a fatal blow to the structure, not welded together by anything other than precedent and tradition, of the British democratic process itself. 
That act can be seen as ushering in a new level in the drive towards global domination by what some call The New World Order and others, who don’t like that title’s conspiracy theory connotations, call globalism. For the rest of this article I will use New World Order – NWO to refer to this phenomenon. 
George Bush senior was already US president, The Berlin Wall had fallen and The USSR was on the verge of collapse. In Britain things reverted to business as usual controlled by a small elite comprised of the old elite and the “ new globalists” This push for global economic control would go into overdrive with the arrival of Tony Blair in 10 Downing Street and Bill Clinton in The White House. On both sides of the Atlantic voters rejoiced as they thought they were getting a fresh, new alternative but, not for the last time over the coming years, it would take a little while for us all to realise just how wrong we all were. The Glass Steagal Act was repealed. Prices that the public couldn’t escape such as utility bills began skyrocketing all over the western world and the western world began moving inexorably eastward as the EU and NATO began swallowing the newly liberated countries of central and eastern Europe. Yugoslavia was attacked from within and without and dismembered, accompanied by, for the first time, a coordinated uniform media propaganda campaign in order to inform us as to who the “bad guy” was and why such an act was necessary! The next massive ramp up in this campaign came in the wake of 9-11! Afghanistan and Iraq were invaded, then came the so called “Arab Spring” Libya was invaded and its government overthrown, Then Syria became the West’s next target. When the West was finally prevented from attacking Syria outright in 2013 by Russia and China they turned in revenge on Ukraine overthrowing its government and installing a rabidly anti-Russian, racist replacement but failing in their ultimate goal; the control of Crimea and the Russian naval base in Sevastopol. So the West proceeded to start up a civil war in that country. All this time, the western public seemed unaware or unable or unwilling to counter this steam roller at home and abroad. Seemingly acquiescent due to the same media campaigns that always vilified the target country’s rulers or leader and told us all that we had to intervene on the grounds of human rights and democracy promotion. There were some antiwar protests over Iraq in 2003 but after that nothing. The people of Greece voted against the austerity measures forced on them by The International Monetary Fund but the new, so called “extreme left” government turned out to be NWO stooges who betrayed their people and the ship sailed on. 
Sailed on that is until 23 rd June 2016. The Brexit vote in the UK brought about by an absurd political mistake on the part of David Cameron was the first real sign that people were beginning to show that they had had enough of being led by the nose by a semi anonymous ruling elite. True, the majority to leave was not huge but it was big enough to be decisive and threw a historic spanner in the works of the NWO’s drive for ever further integration bound up with secret economic treaties and aims. 
The news today however, 9 th November in the year of grace 2016 from the United States is truly earth shattering. I knew Donald Trump would win for at least a month but the size of this historic victory is astounding and too big to allow for falsifications. At the risk of sounding banal; this election result by itself HAS made America great again! It shows, as did Brexit, that just maybe, democracy is not dead, well not completely anyway and that people are not as easy to manipulate as many elites and pessimistic anti-elites, anti-NWO minded souls seemed to think! 
The entire American mainstream media and that of the entire western world was against him. Most of the senior members of his own party were against him. The CIA, The Pentagon, Hollywood, all the country’s leading banks and financial institutions were against him. A whole host of media “celebrities” of all kinds were trotted out to cheer for Clinton. Even the sitting President, against constitutional rules, came out and propagandized for the “designated candidate and against Trump. Such a situation is utterly unprecedented in the history of the US. However, the American people turned round and said NO by a decisive majority. Trump’s election is truly historic. 
Analysts say that in the Brexit vote and the US election the voter group that really made the difference were working class voters. There were several moments in my life starting at secondary school and on into my late twenties when I had prolonged contact with the English working class. Mainly in and around London but also in the north east and north west of England. These people in general live for today instinctively and have a pretty good dose of common sense (so prized by the ancient Greeks) unlike the “chattering classes” and it is no surprise to me at all that they, on mass, have seen through the propaganda manipulations that have managed to ensnare those who we are led to believe have more “education”. I should add that I had some contact with the French working class when I first started living there and my impression was that they were deeply corrupted by the ego based ideology of communism where common sense cannot be found. This was in 1990 though and the world has changed greatly since then. Communism, for different reasons was never attractive to the American and British working class even in bygone days when they were huge statistically speaking and when communism seemed, unstoppably, to be on the road to world hegemony. 
What will this massive, popular, intuitive rebellion against the NWO bring to the world? 
Some commentators have issued similar warnings as this by Marcus Papadopoulos: “ The people who regard Donald Trump as some sort of saviour are, undoubtedly, the same people who thought the same of Boris Johnson .” Sure, it could be that the whole thing is an act to fool us yet again and that Trump will continue exactly the same policies as his predecessor (or as Clinton’s) once in the White House just as his predecessor continued exactly the same policies as his predecessor when he entered The White House eight years before. We were fooled into thinking that Obama represented a real alternative to the Bush years. Such warnings basically say that Trump could well be yet another NWO stooge. Personally, while acknowledging that this is a possibility, I think it is the least likely of all the reasons why the change all sane people are praying for may not come about. My certainty he would become president increased when I saw a video compilation of interview excerpts dating back to 1980 concerning the subject of him possibly standing for president. I could feel the destiny in it and if I read it right he will be one of the most important presidents in history. It also confirmed something I always noticed. Like him or not, he remains consistent. This is the 100% opposite of NWO politicians such as Boris Johnson or Angela Merkel who can make total “U turns” in declared policy without so much as batting an eyelid when it is demanded of them and carry on talking to their electorate as if nothing has happened. 
Far, far more likely is that he is genuinely anti-NWO and really intends to “drain the swamp” but will meet with such resistance and sabotage in every form imaginable from simple refusal to obey orders and procrastination to assassination attempts, terrorist acts or even on up to starting World War Three before he gets to set up in the Oval Office. It should not be forgotten that the NWO has been relentlessly tightening its grip on every aspect of the US power structure, including the mass media and Hollywood, since George Bush Senior became president and over the last ten or so years have got “their people” in the corridors of power and in all the MSN in Europe too and now, if they suddenly face the possibility of losing it all, they are not going to let that happen quietly. As I write, demonstrations, apparently organized and funded by Georges Soros , one of the most sinister and powerful NWO rulers, are taking place in many American towns and cities. If Trump is genuine, people such as Soros, The Rockefellers, the entire Neo-con clan to name but a few, are now absolutely seething, maybe panicking but certainly plotting how to get their world domination plans back on track and they will stop at nothing. It could be a very unusual and maybe long two months to the 20 th of January 2017. 
In his victory speech Trump talked about dreaming big so let’s dream big now about just exactly how far this could go. 
It wasn’t until the end of a day absorbing the fact that he had actually won that I realised, with some horror, just how deeply I had become used to the idea of a looming third world war which would probably be nuclear. I had just slowly but surely, day after day, over the last three years become accustomed to that nightmare. As I went to bed I saw that this nightmare had considerably receded due to Trump’s victory. Had Clinton won, I was down the visa center the very next day and on the first plane back to Russia because if I’m going to die or contribute to the struggle in any way then it must be, before God, on the side of righteousness and that is not, unfortunately, the side the rulers of my home country have chosen to take. It is the west that is entirely responsible for the current tensions with Russia. If Russia is guilty of anything it is not having resisted the creeping but relentlessly approaching attack, earlier and more forcefully. Yes; it really is that black and white! It really is that simple! It seems that the ruling elites behind Clinton were-are actually preparing for a nuclear war with Russia. If Trump is true to his word and he finds the way to pass to action (massive purging of the CIA and much of the Pentagon will be needed) he will simply stop the drive to WW3 just as Putin and his ministers have found the way to avoid or postpone it over the last three years without giving in on vital issues such as Crimea or Syria falling to ISIS. What greater dream could any conscious person have than the possibility to avoid what would be by far the most destructive war in history. 
We should not forget that the default setting of human beings, as with all other gregarious organisms on this planet is to build basic common good, to cooperate with each other and make their lives easier, more comfortable and more prosperous than the day before or the year before. Left to their own devices this is what people always do. There are quarrels for sure and bickering but massively destructive wars are very rare or non existent in nature of which we are a part. It therefore becomes clear that if recent human history has been constantly blighted by ever more destructive, massive conflicts, this is being manipulated by something or someone. Everyone can see that Russia and the western world have every interest in cooperating with each other and no rational reason to fight each other. The NWO order plans to dismember Russia into smaller compliant states having her natural resources controlled by their small pool of multinational corporations. Then it plans to move on to China and do the same. For that it needs to have western public behind that drive hence the press is enlisted to tell the NWO subjects what to think! Once they get control of Russia and China, then they turn on their own citizens and proceed to the micro-chipped enslavement of humanity. Many commentators believe that if they are thwarted in these endevours, they would prefer to destroy the planet rather than face defeat. Ridiculous? Wild scare mongering? I hope so but the rapid developments in international affairs over the last five years don’t allow me to dismiss out of hand such extreme interpretations, unfortunately. 
Let us remember that whenever quizzed by the hostile MSM Trump repeatedly asked; why can’t we have a world where Russia, China and the USA all get along and cooperate. Many, so many, have posed the same question on social media, alternative media and at home, in pubs, restaurants, parks, sports clubs and wherever. Donald Trump could make this come about and only him because IT IS THE WEST and ABOVE ALL The USA, not Russia, China, Iran or Easter Island or anywhere else which is seeking world domination and maybe leading us to Armageddon. Russia and China have been asking for and waiting for nothing other than mutually advantageous cooperation for the last twenty five years or so. Whether Donald Trump actually manages to bring such peace and cooperation to fruition or whether he fails or is checkmated by the foe, whether he turns out to be a fraud, (like so many before him) who will betray those who voted for him and the rest of us outside the US who have to put our trust in him or whether some other event will prevent him from fulfilling his plans and dreams or indeed propel him towards fulfilling them, we cannot yet know but only a short amount of time will tell. 
For now, as I stated above, I choose trust my intuition, to take Donald Trump at face value and wish him every possible success as the forty fifth President of The United States of America. May God be with him and all who work with him because he and they will certainly need divine inspiration and guidance! The stakes for mankind have never been higher! In the meantime; however this plays out, The New World Order globalist agenda, as well as its control of the media and the falsehood of its current totalitarian control false dogmas; “political correctness” in the west and “Islamic fundamentalism” in the Muslim world are more exposed and understood by “we the people” for what they really are than at any time in history and that can only before the common good!

Hybrid Wars 8. Strategies Against Africa (1B),"* Blue: SGR (dashed lines indicate the possibility to expand to Kisangani) * Dark Green: Kenya-Tanzania interconnection * Pink: Central Corridor * Light Green: TAZARA 
The above map demonstrates the integral role that the East African Community (which has plans to one day integrate into the East African Federation) plays in future north-south TFTA economic integration, with it being visibly obvious that the marked transport corridors are absolutely essentially for connecting the Mediterranean Sea coast of Egypt to the Southern Ocean shores of South Africa. It should be remarked that the map doesn’t show that TAZARA also indirectly connects to Zimbabwe via the Livingstone border crossing, and thenceforth the freight that’s passing along it has the possibility to travel onwards to the South Africa-central railway network that integrates most of the Southern Cone. Therefore, should the above-listed projects become fully completed as planned, the only additional construction that would then have to be undertaken is the modernization of the TAZARA and some of its Southern Cone-related networks and the creation of a reliable Egypt-Sudan rail link to South Sudan and Ethiopia. 
Towards An East-West Interconnection: 
As important as this eventual bidirectional transport route might prospectively become, it’s useful to speak about the possibility of expanding it to become an historically unprecedented bicoastal network between the Indian and Atlantic Oceans. To recall the first map that was presented in this part of the study, there are basically five regions in Africa which have their own existing or possible (as in the case of the DRC) leader: 
The envisioned north-south connectivity of the TFTA only integrates three of them – Egypt, Ethiopia, and South Africa, while leaving much of the DRC’s potential outside of the economic construct and completely avoiding Nigeria. Furthermore, while all of these leadership nodes could theoretically trade with one another via maritime routes, it would be much more efficient if they were also tied together via mainland rail-based ones as well, particularly if this could ever pan out with Ethiopia and Nigeria. Regretfully, however, the Failed State Belt of South Sudan and the Central African Republic indefinitely precludes this from becoming a reality, so the next best alternative in the medium-term is to connect Ethiopia with the emerging economic powers and sub-regional leaders of Tanzania and Angola. The former could be accomplished via the earlier-examined transport network taking root in the East African Community, but there’s yet to be any discussed possibility of doing so with the latter, nor any viably proposed solution for integrating the DRC into the larger framework. As for establishing a mainland corridor between Nigeria and Angola, there’s no pressing motivation to do so because the Atlantic Coastal space between them isn’t worth the economic investment due to its very small cumulative market size (roughly 6.5 million people), the challenging jungled terrain, the concentration of internationally-coveted resources along the coast, and the fact that existing maritime access routes are cost-efficient and work quite well. 
The author has carefully observed that it’s not impossible to accomplish the logistical-transport goal of linking Ethiopia and Tanzania with the Atlantic and that the solution lies in the improvisation of two additional transport corridors – one through the DRC and along the Congo River, and the other as a rail route branching off from TAZARA and connecting to Angola. Concerning the first proposal, it’s possible to ship goods down the Congo River from Kisangani, which would become even more important and practical if the city were to one day become connected to Kenya’s SGR project. From the capital of Kinshasa, after having picked up various resources along the way, it’s just another short rail trip to Matadi and beyond the Congo’s unpassable rapids in order to reach the Atlantic Coast. As it relates to Angola, TAZARA can either be linked to Katanga Province’s existing but highly dilapidated rail network or pass through the Barotseland region of western Zambia via the Northwest Railway Project in order to reach the Angolan DRC-bordering rail terminal of Luau. The Benguela Railroad that was recently refurbished with Chinese assistance connects this city to the Atlantic port of Lobito and also has the possibility of integrating with the DRC if Katanga’s nearby railroads were ever modernized and the relevant ones put back online. 
The Angola-TAZARA possible connections via the Northwest Railway Project and the suggested route through Katanga Province are conceptualized in the map below alongside the proposed Congo River transport corridor: 
* Light Blue: Congo River Route * Grey: TAZARA-Benguela linkup via the Northwest Railway Project and transit through Katanga Province. 
This last map signifies the Chinese Silk Road vision for Africa and will form the guiding basis for the rest of the author’s study into the US’ Hybrid War plans for sabotaging this transoceanic network. Having acquired an appreciation for Beijing’s plans throughout the continent, it’s now relevant to remind the reader of the earlier concept that was expressed about the trilateral threat that conflicts in Burundi, Katanga Province, and Malawi may pose for the viability of the ‘Transoceanic African Corridor’. Should one, two, or all three of these erupt into large-scale violence, then it might create enough military-strategic complications that they essentially divide the TFTA into two separate north-south zones as well: 
* Red: TFTA * Black: Potential Conflict Zones * Arrows: Expected Destabilization Trajectories 
Factoring in the existing violence in South Sudan which renders the LAPSSET and SGR projects there unfeasible for the time being, it’s clear to see that China’s far-reaching plans face a formidable challenge in application. Even in the event that only partial segments of LAPSSET, SGR, and the Central Corridor are created, that would still be an impressive victory for the Asian Great Power because the two anchor economies of Kenya and Tanzania are important enough in their own right to warrant the investments and risk involved. Still, it would be most preferable for more of the network than that to be created, especially as it provides the most surefire guarantee of the region’s multipolar sovereignty and the greatest promise of liberating the rest of Africa from direct unipolar influence. 
Before progressing to the book’s first African regional analysis, it’s worthwhile to revisit the order of research and recall exactly what’s being studied. It’s already been established from the most recent maps why the Hybrid War threats in the Horn of Africa, East Africa, and Central-Southern Africa are being investigated, but as for Nigeria, the sheer size of Africa’s largest economy means that it’s impossible to exclude despite the existence of the Failed State Belt indefinitely preventing the emergence of a reliable Ethiopia-Nigeria mainland route. Additionally, because of Nigeria’s inclusion into the work, it’s thereby also necessary to address the Hybrid War threats related to its most relevant Nigerien, Chadian, and Cameroonian neighbors, especially seeing as how they’re all facing the same Boko Haram foe. 
To remind the reader of the particular category that each country falls into and which section of the research it’ll be addressed in, it’s useful to revisit the map from the beginning of the introduction: 
* Green – Horn of Africa * Yellow – East Africa/East African Federation * Blue – Central-Southern Africa * Black – Failed State Belt * Red – Lake Chad Region * Hashed/Thatched Lines – countries that will inevitably become involved in the targeted category states’ Hybrid War destabilization, whether as an aggressive actor, a passive victim, or a blended mix thereof. 
Going forward, the research will proceed with the order that the map’s key was presented in, meaning that the Horn of Africa will be examined first and the Lake Chad Region will be covered last. Each categorized section may focus either on the region in general or be split up into various parts that more comprehensively study some or all of the affiliated countries. 
The style will vary depending on what the author thinks is necessary to properly convey the pertinent points in mind, so the reader is advised not to hold any particular expectations about formatting and length. Country studies will undoubtedly be commenced, but it’s unlikely that they will be done on as comprehensive of a scale as the ones for ASEAN. The justification for this difference is seen by all of the Southeast Asian states’ heightened economic importance in the global economy and their premier geopolitical importance in occupying the strategic space between China and India’s overlapping spheres of interests, as well as their ‘gatekeeper’ status in controlling mainland and maritime access to the Indian and Pacific Oceans. 
Having explained that, the forthcoming African analyses aim to fully address all the Hybrid War threats facing each specific country and their general region, thereby preemptively exposing the various mechanisms that the US can exploit and hopefully giving the targeted populations and their governments enough time to prepare adequate countermeasures in response.

Macedonian Media: Ruling Party About To Win Over Western Mercenaries,"'The Others' Alliances , Balkans , Hybrid Wars By Andrew KORYBKO (USA) We are publishing the exclusive English source of the interview given by the American political analyst Andrew Korybko to the Macedonian NetPress agency. He speaks about the forthcoming early parliamentary elections to be held in Macedonia on 11 December 2016 which are likely to be won by the ruling VMRO party of Nikola Gruevski, the effective defeat and demoralization of the globalist agents in the Balkans, and geoeconomic implications of the new political landscape in the region: 
Less than one month before the early parliamentary elections in Macedonia, the polls indicate a clear victory for the ruling party of VMRO-DPMNE lead by Nikola Gruevski. This on the other hand represents a mayor failure for the Western elements and their NGO/media machinery that in the past 2 years have been trying to overthrow the democratically elected Macedonian government together with the opposition lead by SDSMs Zoran Zaev, using methods such as Color Revolutions, public broadcasting of illegally wiretapped conversations, violent opposition protests, terrorist attacks, the formation of the so-called “special” prosecution, fabricating false scandals with alleged phantom voters and fake IDs, etc. What can we expect to be happening in Macedonia ahead of after the 11 December elections? 
It’s clear that VMRO will be handed a resounding victory by the people, but voters still need to go to the polls in order to make this the largest success that it can be and give Gruevski the unquestionable mandate that he will need to govern the post-crisis country. All surveys indicate that this will be the case, but people mustn’t become apathetic and assume that it’ll be a landslide just because everyone else is supposedly going to vote and instead choose to stay home. Everyone needs to go to the polls and make this election the crowning achievement of the patriotic counter-Color Revolution movement. If VMRO can clinch an overwhelming majority of the votes, then the rest of the world will see once and for all that the people have spoken and democratically expressed both their support for the legitimate government and their rejection of the Western-orchestrated Color Revolution. Nikola Gruevski 
In the run-up to the vote, there were clear signs that efforts were made by SDSM to unite the opposition into a solid bloc, but this failed because nobody really trusts Zaev. If a man will betray the entire country by becoming the figurehead of a Western regime change operation, then he’ll surely sell out any of his “political allies” if given the opportune chance to do so. Most patriotic opposition members recognize this and thus don’t want to contaminate their political brand, which is why the effort has thus far been a failure. Similarly, Zaev’s shameless pandering to Albanian voters has also been a dud. The demographic is aware that they’re being exploited, and while some admittedly find it flattering, many of them don’t want to be part of his international political games and know that the doesn’t truly have their best interests at heart. 
By and large, there’s no reason to second guess that VMRO and Gruevski are headed for an historic win in this election. Should this come to pass as expected, then Macedonians can look forward to a new era of stability and prosperity, with their country working equally with the West and East (Russia, China, BRICS) in order to maximize its geostrategic position as the prime infrastructural gateway to Europe. Russia is moving ahead with the Balkan Stream gas pipeline while China is making progress on the Balkan Silk Road high-speed rail system which will eventually link Budapest to Piraeus. Western investment, while having likely been impacted to an extent by the manufactured political crisis, hasn’t fled the country like it ordinarily would have in many other cases. Businessmen understand that Macedonia is growing and is an attractive place to set up shop because of its irreplaceable mainland location at the civilizational crossroads of Afro-Eurasia. 
All of this is indeed possible so long as the US pulls back from its recent history of destabilizing the Republic of Macedonia. Washington and its conspirators have already been beaten back twice – something which no other country has managed to do – and are slated for at third defeat during the December elections. The US’ behavior during this time will be contingent on how it’s “deep state” (the permanent military, intelligence, and diplomatic bureaucracies) decides to response. The US is undergoing the most transformational phased regime change event that it has ever experienced in history with Obama’s government giving way to President-elect Trump’s, so it remains to be seen if the “deep state’s” subjectively determined cost-benefit calculation will continue to lean in favor of asymmetrical destabilization. 
A reasonably confident argument can be made that won’t. Commencing yet another wave of failed Color Revolutions would be a waste of time, money, and resources if Trump simply decides to stop it once he enters office. On the other hand, Obama and his neoconservative “deep state” backers might be conspiratorially vengeful enough that they’d want to sabotage Trump’s incoming presidency by forcing him to inherit a legacy of conflict. Even if that’s the case, however, it doesn’t seem likely that this would succeed, since it’s obvious to all observers that the Macedonian people have repeatedly proven that all foreign-concocted plots against their statehood are determined to fail. Because of this, the US probably won’t opt to continue with this failed plan any longer, and will attempt to ‘save face’ by recognizing VMRO and Gruevski’s imminent victory, hoping that this can allow them to earn back some of the goodwill that they needlessly squandered over the years. 
Seen from this perspective, one can definitely conclude that the western sponsored wing together with their patrons, failed in Macedonia big time. What are the main factors that according to you helped Macedonia deal with these foreign sponsored crises, which can be used as an example for other countries that are or will be fighting these kinds of Western sponsored crises? 
Macedonians were able to withstand and repel the US’ Hybrid War pressure because they came to master the art of what I call the Resistance Circle, which is a counter-Color Revolution innovation which must absolutely be applied to all countries that are experiencing this form of aggression. Here’s an illustration of this concept, and then I’ll explain what each part of it means in practice: Media: 
Macedonians were already an educated and aware even before the Hybrid War started, and this can be attributed to the prevalence of patriotic media outlets in the country, both mainstream and alternative. They kept the public informed of the US’ various regime change machinations across the world before Washington inevitably came to victimizing their homeland. Once the destabilization began, the media kept the people up to date on what was really going on and the larger forward-looking reasons behind it, which had the effect of heightening the already strong sense of patriotism that most Macedonians feel. Patriotism: 
Macedonian patriots formed the core of the counter-Color Revolution movement. They were inspired by the media and what they saw happening all around them and conveyed the extent of the regime change plot to the rest of their fellow citizens. They knew that this wasn’t just an operation targeting Gruevski personally, but a far-reaching scheme that affects all Macedonians through its goals of changing the constitutional name, “federalizing” (internally partitioning) the country, and thus advancing a dangerous and treasonous scenario which could result in the dismantlement of Macedonia’s hard-fought statehood. Organizing: 
The patriots utilized reverse-Color Revolution technology by applying some “traditional” models of large-scale crowd organizing through their skillful employment of social media and allied NGOS. This produced attention-grabbing demonstrations in support of the government and culminated most spectacularly in the May 2015 demonstrations that decisively dealt a death blow to the first failed Color Revolution. The external manifestation of the Macedonian people’s patriotism and their backing of the democratically elected and legitimate government sent a powerful normative message all across the world, especially since it came on the heels of Zaev’s comparably much smaller rally. International Networking: 
Macedonia’s patriots networked with foreign friends and journalists to spread the truth about the regime change operation underway in their country, particularly relying on the influential power of Russian mass media, experts, and think tanks to champion their resistance. 
This propelled heavy alternative media coverage of the events and put pressure on the plotters by exposing their links with the US and Soros, thus discrediting the false narrative that this was an ‘indigenous democratic uprising’ and revealing it as the Western Color Revolution that it always was. 
At this point, the multipolar media coverage, analysis, and investigations into the unrest were channeled back into Macedonia’s patriotic mainstream and alternative media outlets for domestic consumption, which fuelled the patriotism and encouraged even more counter-Color Revolution demonstrations and related activity. 
It’s quite interesting to see the shock of the fifth column in Macedonia after Donald Trump won the USA elections, which was quite similar to their reaction to the Brexit as well. Why is there such despair among the Western mercenaries in Macedonia and what does Trump’s victory mean for the Western-sponsored crises and Color revolutions elsewhere? 
The reason why they’re so upset is because they realize that Trump’s election will likely herald in a sea change of American policy in some (operative word) vectors, notably how it relates to Soros and Color Revolutions . Trump’s campaign team and alternative media surrogates such as Breitbart made a point of emphasizing the disruptive role that Soros has been playing in the US, such as shedding light on his support for pro-Clinton Super PACs, funding the urban extremist group known as “Black Lives Matter”, and even indirectly being connected to some electronic voting machine companies. In fact, one of the least-discussed but most important aspects of Trump’s election is how it affects Soros and his worldwide network now that the billionaire Color Revolution financier’s chief foe will be in the Oval Office. Trump and his base are antipathetic to Soros in all ways, even more so nowadays because of the shadowy figure’s role in organizing the nationwide riots against the President-elect. To put it bluntly, Soros has declared war on Trump, and the incoming President is expected to push back in all ways in order to safeguard his Presidency. 
There’s a lot that can be written about the dynamics of this struggle and the widespread influence that Soros commands among The Establishment and its “academia’, pop culture, media, and social elites, but explaining all of that would require a lot more time and a broader scope than is presently available. How all of this relates to the Balkans, and specifically to Macedonia, is rather simple, in fact. Soros, preoccupied with tackling Trump, will probably direct a lot less time and energy towards his traditional stomping grounds, especially considering that he’s already failed two times in trying to topple the Macedonian government. Furthermore, Soros won’t have the incoming Trump Administration’s foreign policy and covert support to back him up. Remember, Trump disdains Soros, and the feeling is mutual. They’re not going to cooperate on any major schemes together, or at least not right away, but here’s where the possible scenarios get rather interesting. Trump and Soros want to destroy one another, but it’s possible that they could reach a ‘ceasefire’ arrangement between themselves in putting their mutual differences aside and focusing on areas of ‘shared interest’. 
What this means in practice is that the neoconservative elements of the American “deep state” (the permanent military, intelligence, and diplomatic bureaucracies) might be able to influence Trump and his team to the point where they come to appreciate the covert foreign policy utility of the worldwide Soros network. If this happens, and provided that Soros is on the retreat due to the Trump Administration’s relentless hounding of him, then it’s possible for the President to reach a deal with the Color Revolution architect whereby Soros would stop or lessen his anti-Trump attacks in exchange for the new American government being able to utilize his global regime change ‘services’ again. On the other hand, however, it’s also possible that Trump defeats Soros and takes over his organization, investing time and resources to ‘retool’ it from a “far-left/hyper-liberal” group to something more aligned with the global conservative and “right-wing” zeitgeist in order to make it more attractive and operationally effective in this day and age. It’s still too early to tell which way things may or may not go, but these are reasonable ideas to countenance given the existing state of affairs. 
The point in bringing this all up is to emphasize the very real split between Soros and his American governmental facilitators/criminals-in-arms. Trump’s Administration will be the first time when the US won’t blindly support Soros in all of his endeavors, and is ironically one of the mastermind’s targets this time around. This paramount asymmetrical conflict can’t help but interfere with Soros’ other operations all across the world, which, to get back to answering the main part of the question, is why the fifth column is so distraught at Trump’s victory. They also know that the “politically incorrect” President-elect doesn’t support their wild post-modern “liberal” views such as attacking conservative societies through the weaponization of homosexuality and destabilizing their centuries-old value systems. It’s indeed possible that Trump might be convinced by the CIA and some other “deep state” actors to tolerate the mild continuance of this campaign in some key geostrategic states, but seeing as how it’s so spectacularly failed in Macedonia, the Balkan country probably won’t be a top priority for him like it was for Obama. 
Iran, however, will be, since several high-profile voices around Trump and a few of the people who he’s rumored to be considering for crucial Cabinet positions have openly declared that the US must foment regime change in the Islamic Republic, but of course, the specifics of this could be discussed at another time. It’s just important to know that Color Revolutions won’t become an outdated weapon of the past just because of the Trump-Soros War, and everyone should always remember that the President of the US is still the leader of the world’s pioneer in unconventional destabilizations. The US still wants to retain and strengthen its hegemony, but Trump and his team feel that some fundamental tweaking must be made to the system in order for it to become much more effective. Most of the substance will remain the same, but it’s just that some of the style will change. I explored some of the details pertaining to this in my Sputnik article titled “ Here’s What Trump’s Foreign Policy Will Look Like ”, and I welcome all interested readers to check it out if they want to have a more comprehensive forecast about the future nature of American behavior abroad. 
I must say, however, that no one should get their hopes up that Trump’s rule will herald in the US’ retreat from abroad – he’s been very clear from the start that his guiding mantra is “America First”, and while opposed to some of Obama’s foreign policy platforms, he’ll probably end up retaining some of them even if he rebrands them with his own style. He’s a pragmatic businessman who knows how to make deals, which is why the Great Powers of Russia and China have cautiously optimistic hopes that he’ll usher in a period (however brief) of New Détente in the New Cold War, but just because Trump might ease up the US’ pressure on one or both of these Eurasian anchors doesn’t mean that he won’t up the ante against Iran, Pakistan, and perhaps some other unforeseen targets of Washington’s wrath. 
Greek diplomatic sources have briefed Greek media that the implementation of the Turkish stream is now moving faster than expected and the projections are that the construction will begin this year, while ending in 2019. Some information says that Gazprom and the EC are now getting close to agreement. What does your information say? 
I don’t have any exclusive information about this project, but my analysis about its progress is that things have been moving along quite well ever since the game-changing Russian-Turkish rapprochement over the summer, which, to remind everyone, was the reason why the US hastened to clumsily arrange a failed coup attempt against President Erdogan. I discussed the specifics of this more thoroughly in my Oriental Review article about “ Reassessing The Reasons For The Failed Turkish Coup Attempt ”, and just like with my Sputnik piece which I reference in my last answer, this article might also be interesting for some readers to go through if they have the time and inclination to do so. I bring up the failed pro-US coup attempt in Turkey because it was hatched with the motivation of reversing the strategic gains that Russia and Turkey were poised to make, one of which is obviously Balkan Stream. 
With Ankara back on board with this Russian megaproject, the only other actor left which needs to fall in line is the EU, which – regardless of its US-ordered and politically driven rhetoric – desperately needs to secure reliable energy sources in the future, and will more than likely end up reaching some agreement with Russia around the time that the first part of the pipeline is completed. The anti-Russian sanctions regime has been cracking for the past year and many Eastern European countries want to ease the restrictions and work with their Russian partners in order to spearhead creative workarounds that would be mutually beneficial for both sides. Sooner or later, the EU will probably give in to its natural self-interested desire to restore relations with Russia and end up hashing out a deal for Balkan Stream. The major impediment to this, however, will remain the Third Energy Package, which Bulgaria clung to as its excuse two years ago in pathetically pretending that it was just “following the law” and wasn’t under any American pressure to obstruct South Stream. 
This totalitarian piece of legislation decrees that a company is not allowed to own both the pipeline and the gas which transits through it. Gazprom argued that this law entered into effect after it had already concluded negotiations on the project and should thus be exempt from its restrictions, but the EU didn’t accept this and said that the Russian company must “play by the rules”. Since Bulgaria was supposed to be the terminal point for the project and the first EU country through which South Stream was planned to pass, it took the vanguard role in stopping the pipeline and thus sacrificed billions of dollars of transit revenue as a result. The same problem could predictably repeat itself with Greece, but I think that Russia preparing a handful of possible solutions for dealing with this. The most realistic one would be to partner up with trusted companies and jointly own either all of the pipeline or each national section that it’s supposed to transit through, even if Gazprom gets 49% and its ally has a 51% controlling stake. 
Since Balkan Stream will pass through a bunch of countries, it’s more realistic for each leg to be jointly owned by a different national partner, so for example, this could be DEPA in Greece, just like it’s Botas for Turkey. The model of working with individual partner companies in each transit state could be replicated all throughout the line’s forecasted route, but the liability is that unexpected disputes with one or another partner could lead to downstream disruptions if a national actor decided to “pull a Ukraine”, though there’s nothing at this time to suggest that such a scenario will happen. Likewise, being overly dependent on one or two major regional companies which could jointly operate the entire line with Russia could create a situation where the said company feels overly empowered and tries to push Russia around one day (whether on its own initiative or under pressure from the US). Therefore, having multipole stakeholders all along the route could ironically be a much more stable alternative because it means that everyone else would put pressure on the disruptive actor in the event that they ‘go rogue’ and do the US geostrategic bidding. 
What we need to look forward to now is the business diplomacy that will inevitably commence sometime in the future and monitor this to the best of our abilities in order to get a clearer picture of Balkan Stream’s technical-administrative aspects. Gazprom will obviously look to enter into deals with its partners in order to get around the Third Energy Package, but knowing the Russian giant, it’ll probably conduct a lot of these in secret in order to keep the details under wraps so it might be difficult to find out what’s really happening. This is why it’s so useful to use models such as the joint ownership one which I just explained in order to have an initial framework for testing hypotheses and seeing how well they correlate to the unfolding reality. I don’t have any idea about the timeframe for these negotiations, but it’s safe to say that the ones with Greece will definitely be concluded by the time that the first part of the pipeline is completed with Turkey, and Russia might also by that time line up agreements with Macedonia, Serbia, and Hungary in order to move as fast as possible from that point onwards in pairing Balkan Stream’s logical northwards expansion with China’s Balkan Silk Road high-speed rail project.

Hybrid Wars 8. In The Horn Of Africa (IIA),"Please read Introduction, Part IA and I B before this chapter. 
The Horn of Africa has the second most globally geostrategic location on the continent behind North Africa, straddling the commercially vital Red Sea and providing international access to the world’s fastest-growing economy of Ethiopia. In this sense, the coastal states acquire a dual maritime and mainland importance through which their territories can be simultaneously used to exert influence along the waterway and the regional interior. Furthermore, as it relates to the Red Sea, this body of water occupies a crucial role in China’s grand strategy because it serves as the most geographically convenient route for facilitating the transit of goods between the East Asian state and the EU, which is particularly expected to climb with the completion of the Balkan Silk Road in a few years’ time. Due to the importance that China places on the One Belt One Road grand strategy and the need that it has for maintaining and strengthening its overseas markets (especially the large and ever-promising EU one) in order to sustain domestic stability and long-term growth, it logically has an inherent interest in preserving stability in the Horn of Africa so as to safeguard its Sea Line of Communication (SLOC) to Europe. For similar reasons, it also wants to tap into the allied Ethiopian economy and assist in the maximization of its potential so as to acquire a strategic presence there that allows it to deepen its presence further inland into the continent’s resource-rich interior. 
It should be no surprise then that the Horn of Africa is the focal point of international military attention, as evidenced by the previous part of the research which described the vast array of foreign non-African military bases in Djibouti, the recent GCC presence in Eritrea, and the Turkish and Emirati plans for building a base in Somalia. Quite naturally and in accordance with its obvious interests, China is opening its first overseas military base in Djibouti in order take advantage of the country’s dual role in exercising maritime and mainland influence. It’s clear how and why the tiny coastal state can be used by Beijing for flexing its maritime muscles, but it’s less obvious how it plans to do this in the opposite mainland direction. It’s therefore relevant to recall the Ethiopia-Djibouti Railway that China is building between the coastal city and the inland capital, since this large-scale infrastructure project will serve as the umbilical cord between the Chinese and Ethiopian economies and also allow the later to finally and reliably access the global market in general. Moreover, the connective vision that China is pursuing is complemented by the Kenyan-originating LAPSSET project that it’s also helping to finance , which eventually plans to connect Addis Ababa with the Indian Ocean port of Lamu by rail . Suffice to say, the completion of both transnational railways and the Djibouti-based military facility will catapult China into being the most influential country in the Horn of Africa region, although this seemingly inevitable reality will expectedly be opposed by the US using the methods of Hybrid War. 
This part of the research therefore endeavors to explain all of the ways in which the US could apply Hybrid War strategy in order to conceivably offset China’s grand designs in the Horn of Africa region. It begins by offering a general overview of regional relations that sets the appropriate context for deeper analysis. After having established the state of affairs and provided a solid understanding of each examined countries’ interactions with the other, the second portion of the work then delves into a summary of these states’ strategic situations, focusing primarily on their most influential determinants. Finally, the last part of the regional study looks at the most realistic Hybrid War scenarios that the US could possibly provoke against China’s Horn of Africa interests. Thorny Relations In The Horn 
The four states that occupy the Horn of Africa region – Eritrea, Ethiopia, Djibouti, and Somalia – don’t all have pristine relations with one another, with the most obvious problems being between Eritrea & Somalia on one side and Ethiopia on the other. 
Ethiopia-Eritrea 
To explain the reason behind the abysmal relations between these two states, it’s necessary to begin by talking about Eritrea’s bloody three-decade-long secessionist war against Ethiopia which only ended in 1993. The roots of the conflict are many, but they can be summarized as starting during the imperial period when the Kingdom of Italy annexed Eritrea from the larger civilization-state of Abyssinia in 1890, thenceforth giving it a sense of identity separateness from Ethiopia and planting the seeds for future conflict after the two entities were reunified following the end of World War II. Addis Ababa’s unilateral 1962 abolishment of the ten-year-old Federation of Ethiopia and Eritrea sparked the separatist war that raged throughout the proceeding decades, and even after independence, the two countries remained at tense odds with one another over the expectation that there would eventually be a continuation war sometime in the future. 
This came to pass from 1998-2000, and despite ending in what has been described as a lingering stalemate , it killed over one hundred thousand people and undermined the economic development potential of these two dramatically impoverished states. In the years since, Ethiopia and Eritrea have still remained each other’s primary nemesis, with the two sides regularly accusing the other of attempting to subvert its stability and supporting various anti-government forces. Just like in the immediate years after independence, there still exists the very real possibility today that the two countries will go to war with one another at a moment’s notice, and this atmosphere of heightened militant tension is the most destabilizing interstate factor in the Horn of Africa. In fact, it will later be argued that this situation is being exploited by the out-of-regional powers inside the GCC as a means of acquiring leverage over Ethiopia and potentially pushing Eritrea into instigating a renewed round of debilitating violence. 
Ethiopia-Somalia 
Although not as bad as its ties with Eritrea, Ethiopia’s relations with Somalia are objectively pretty poor. Granted, on the surface of things there is positive and pragmatic interaction between both states at the government-to-government level, but the primary issue between them has always been the enticing idea of “Greater Somalia” that has captivated some Somalians on both sides of the border and even led to the Ogaden War between 1977-1978. This conflict is notable as being the last conventional attempt to create “Greater Somalia” and also as being the only time when the Soviets and Americans switched sides during a proxy war. The issue was over the status of Somalians in Ethiopia’s sparsely populated eastern region which has now been revealed to be rich i n oil and natural gas deposits, with Addis Ababa claiming that this is an integral part of Ethiopia’s territory and a native people to the multiethnic country while Mogadishu and Somalian nationalists assert that it’s an occupied region whose people must be united with their namesake nation-state. While Somalia has no realistic means of ever reattempting another Ogaden land grab anytime again in the foreseeable future, the appeal of Somalian nationalism is dangerous for Ethiopia and can easily be used by the US and others in order to engineer destabilization inside of Africa’s second-most populous country. 
Complicating matters even further is Ethiopia’s 2006 anti-terrorist intervention in Somalia which aimed to overthrow the extremist Islamic Courts Union (ICU) that had seized control of most of the country. Covertly supported and egged on by the US, Ethiopia invaded its neighbor and succeeded in expelling the militia from the capital, however its subsequent three-year occupation of the country generated a lot of hostility against it and led to a surge in Somalian nationalism. This in turn was taken advantage of by Al Shabaab, an Al Qaeda- and Daesh-linked terrorist group that grew out of the ICU’s youth wing, which blended anti-Ethiopian sentiment, Somalian nationalism, and Islamic extremism in creating a lethal cocktail of hate that has made the group one of the most feared in all of Africa. The Somalian government’s inability to appropriately combat Al Shabaab and the sympathy that misguided Somalians (especially the youth) have to the organization’s twisted message has made it a major regional threat which has the very real potential of actively causing chaos inside of Ethiopia’s Somali Region (formerly called Ogaden). In response, the authorities have been compelled to implement harsh security measures as an anti-terrorist precaution to any Daesh-like attempts to create a transnational territorially administered “Islamic State” within the region, though this has had the inadvertent effect of drawing the ire of some Somali locals and cyclically leading to the same type of anti-government attitudes that Addis Ababa has sought to avoid. 
Ethiopia-Djibouti 
Perhaps the most fruitful and positive relationship in the region is between Ethiopia and its northern Djiboutian neighbor. Demographically and geographically mismatched, the two are inherently tied to one another due to regional circumstances. Ethiopia lost all of its coastal territory with Eritrea’s independence and thereafter became a landlocked state, and the sky-high tensions between it and its former province have precluded any possibility of pragmatic economic cooperation. Similarly, because of the anarchic instability and terrorist threat in Somalia, Ethiopia has been unable to use its territory in acquiring reliable access to the sea (although it has made some positive steps in this direction with the autonomous self-proclaimed and de-facto independent state of Somaliland via the port of Berbera). For the most part, Ethiopia’s economic potential was bottled up inside the Horn of Africa interior and unable to reach the global markets, but China’s visionary and proactive initiative in building the Ethiopia-Djibouti railroad changed all of that. The project essentially turned Djibouti into the ‘cork’ which controls the flow of economic riches into the Ethiopian ‘bottle’, making it a literal bottleneck state in pivotally opening up the massive economic possibilities of its southern neighbor. 
Along the same lines, however, this breakthrough infrastructure development means the tiny country is disproportionately important to Ethiopia and can be used indirectly as a means of destabilizing the much larger and expanding economy of former Abyssinia. Domestic disturbances such as Color Revolution unrest or possible Afar separatism in Djibouti could disrupt access to the railroad and indefinitely cut Ethiopia and its partners off from one another, thus making it totally dependent on the LAPSSET corridor to its south which runs through Oromo-populated territory and could quickly become a tantalizing target for ethnic-affiliated rebel and terrorist groups. With this in mind, it becomes even more apparent why China chose Djibouti as the location of its first overseas military base, since it’s substantially easier to exert positive influence on small Djibouti in safeguarding the viability of its prized railroad investment than in doing so inside of Kenya or anywhere else, and plus, there’s of course the added maritime advantage in being located on the Red Sea. As for how China could predictably protect its railroad, it might either employ the direct use of its military as hinted at in its first-ever 2015 white paper on military strategy in order to protect its foreign interests, or it could end up utilizing private military corporations (PMCs) to indirectly do this instead. 
The bottom line is that Djiboutian stability is absolutely integral for Ethiopia’s strategic security, and it’s for this reason that bilateral relations are extraordinarily close and will foreseeably remain so for the future. Djibouti benefits from this relationship by profiting off of its transit state status in facilitating access to and from the Ethiopian economy, so it has a vested self-interest in protecting the railroad as well. Therefore, it’s expected that it would use its military forces to safeguard the line in the event of any domestic troubles, likely applying the training that they acquired from their Chinese counterparts inside the country and probably even doing so under the supervision of Chinese advisors as well. By functioning as Ethiopia’s critical link to the outside world, Djibouti could also end up being targeted by Eritrea or by Somalian-based terrorist groups as a means of indirectly offsetting the regional hegemon, so this is of course a factor that must be considered. 
Eritrea-Djibouti 
In reference to the previous, Eritrea does not have positive relations with Djibouti and actually fought a brief border war with its neighbor in 2008. As per UN agreement, Qatar has deployed its troops to both countries in order to mediate the conflict and has remained in the region since 2010, presenting another factor of instability vis-à-vis Ethiopia which will be discussed later on. To continue with the state of bilateral relations between the two coastal countries, it’s worthwhile to also mention that Eritrea has actually had problems with all of its neighbors, and this includes Sudan and Yemen (the latter via the Hanish Islands conflict ), which together demonstrates a distinct pattern of Eritrean behavior. Therefore, the 2008 conflict with Djibouti mustn’t be seen in isolation, but rather as a continuation of long-standing Eritrean policy which regularly resorts to militant means to achieve its goals. It can’t be discounted that Qatar and Eritrea might conspire together in supporting Al Shabaab attacks inside of Djibouti in order to inflict strategic harm on Ethiopia, since not only has the Gulf state been convincingly linked to the terrorist organization, but Eritrea is actually under UNSC sanctions for allegedly aiding it in the past (although the latest findings indicate that this relationship may no longer be in effect). Therefore, Eritrea’s relations with Djibouti absolutely must be seen in the prism of its regional proxy war with Ethiopia which conceptualizes the neighboring state between them as a potential asymmetrical battleground. 
Djibouti-Somalia 
On the other side of things, Djibouti’s relations with Somalia are warm and friendly, despite Mogadishu having no de-facto control over the bordering region with the autonomous and self-proclaimed independent state of Somaliland. While there isn’t anything substantial to speak of in this regard, it’s worthwhile mentioning the latent threat that non-state-actor-promoted militant Somali nationalism might pose to Djibouti (including the perverted version espoused by Al Shabaab). The country is mostly populated by the Issa clan, which itself is regarded as a subsect of the Somalis and thus places them within the within the purview of “Greater Somalia”. While this ideal may have had some sway in the Cold War-era past and in the years before and immediately after the former French Somaliland’s independence, it no longer has much of an appeal in Djibouti after Somalia descended into failed state status in 1991, although that isn’t to say that there might not be some people who are still attracted to the romanticized version of this ideology. What’s most threatening, however, isn’t the possibility of passively sympathetic Djiboutians supporting “Greater Somalia” slogans, but Al Shabaab and other terrorist groups violently targeting the country’s nationals and infrastructure projects in order to ostensibly support this vision. 
The varied deployment of so many international non-African military forces in Djibouti makes it unlikely that the terrorists would succeed in inflicting long-term harm to the country or the Ethiopia-Djibouti railroad, but their extremist ideology and willingness to die for their cause makes them very dangerous and leads to the impossibility of discounting this scenario. Still, the relatively better policed and more closely administrated Somaliland region serves as a stop gap in inhibiting Al Shabaab’s direct movement to Djibouti, although it’s of course possible that the organization could infiltrate its coastal target through more conventional means such as covertly entering it by means of the world-famous port and under an assumed cover instead of illegally sneaking across the international border. In any case, the only relevant factor of Djiboutian-Somalian affairs that’s applicable to the Hybrid War research is Al Shabaab and the ideology of “Greater Somalia”, neither of which are promoted at the state level but both of which could lead to serious problems for the targeted country. For this reason, the Djibouti-Somalia axis is the least relevant factor in the Horn of Africa’s regional political arrangement, at least on the official level, although it does have the potential to unconventionally become a major destabilizing issue in the future among certain non-state actors. 
Eritrea-Somalia 
Just like Eritrea views Djibouti, it also holds the same proxy battleground mentality for Somalia as well. If the UNSC’s suspicions about Eritrea’s support of Al Shabaab are to be believed, then it’s clear to see that Asmara is simply employing whatever tool it can get its hands on in order to destabilize Addis Ababa. Whether reckless or justified depending on one’s political disposition, it’s unmistakable that Eritrea’s burning hate for Ethiopia has spread the proxy conflict between them from the joint border all the way to the Somalian frontier, thereby engulfing the region in this turmoil and turning their rivalry into the single most important driver of the Horn of Africa’s geopolitical destabilizations. It’s likely that the Eritrean leadership is no longer as close to Al Shabaab as it was suspected of being before, partly due to increased international stigma and awareness of this relationship, but that doesn’t remove the fact that Asmara may have played a key role in the group’s early development and consequently makes the country responsible to an extent for the organization’s present existence and violent rise. 
Accordingly, the only logical way to view Eritrean-Somalian relations is through the prism of the greater Eritrean-Ethiopian proxy war in the region and the relative benefit that each respective actor gets from Somalia’s stability or insecurity. With that being considered, it can be argued that Eritrea benefits more from Somalia’s instability and the prevalence of militant non-state actors there (including Islamic-affiliated terrorists and “Greater Somalia” nationalists) than it does if normalcy were to return to the country. The arrival of stability would preclude Somalian territory from ever again being used by Eritrea as an asymmetrical springboard against Ethiopia, and it would correspondingly limit Asmara’s strategic flexibility in dealing with its larger and better equipped rival. Since Somalia is gradually becoming more stabilized over the past couple of years, Eritrea’s strategy might shift from allegedly working with terrorist groups to harnessing its new yet unofficial GCC military partnership in order to make inroads with the autonomous and self-proclaimed de-facto independent state of Somaliland. The strategic fusion of Eritrean and GCC capabilities on Ethiopia’s northeastern border might portend a more concerted destabilization sometime in the future, whether of an Islamic terrorist, “Greater Somalian”, or blended nature thereof.

Resource Packet for Allies Travelling to Standing Rock,"Resource Packet for Allies Travelling to Standing Rock Posted on November 1, 2016 Resource Packet for Allies Travelling to Standing Rock Share on Twitter “This is about reflecting on how you can come in a good way, and not about how to be ‘right.'” 
Now that the Indigenous resistance to the Dakota Access Pipeline is grabbing headlines, a growing number of non-native allies are travelling to Standing Rock to stand with the water protectors. And with an urgent call out for people to come and commit civil disobedience to stop this pipeline, there is lots of need for more allies to come and throw down. 
A group of folks called Solidariteam put together a resource packet for people who are showing up without much experience or history with Indigenous spaces and communities; as one member wrote, the packet is “for folks that are navigating the complexities of power, privilege, settler colonialism, shame, solidarity, support, taking leadership from Indigenous communities and taking action.” 
The packet includes information about camp culture, questions to ask yourself before going (and ways you can help from home that you might not have thought of; a lot of folks have skills that make them way more useful at home than in the camp), and cultural protocols written with guidance from camp elders. 
You can find the packet and download the tools at standingrocksolidaritynetwork.org/resource-packet .

Papers found in the car showed he was something else: private DAPL security. 
Early Friday morning, a man bearing an AR-15 rifle broke through a barricade and sped toward the Oceti Sakowin camp, where thousands are camped out to resist the Dakota Access Pipeline. The Standing Rock Sioux Tribe posted an account of what happened next: 
As reported via video evidence from the front lines on 10-27-16. A man berating an assault rifle broke thru a barricade and was speeding toward the Oceti Sakowin camp, he was run off the road 1/4 mile north from the Camp. The man exited the vehicle where he appeared to be disguised as a water protector. He than fired several shots from his assault rifle. Tribal Law Enforcement responded, the man was than apprehended. Insurance Documents from the vehicle reveal that it is owned by Dakota Access Pipeline. We commend the BIA Law Enforcement to their commitment of public safety and for their quick response and apprehension of the suspect who was clearly meanings to do harm. 
The insurance documents also name Thompson-Gray LLC; according to its website, Thompson-Gray LLC provides “programmatic, financial, as well as information technology support” to the Department of Defense.

Insulin’s Inventor Sold the Patent for $1. Then Drug Companies Got Hold of It.,"Insulin’s Inventor Sold the Patent for $1. Then Drug Companies Got Hold of It. Posted on November 14, 2016 Insulin’s Inventor Sold the Patent for $1. Then Drug Companies Got Hold of It. Share on Twitter Never underestimate the greed of a pharmaceutical company. 
Frederick Banting wasn’t a dude who backed down. The Army refused him due to poor eyesight in 1914; in 1915, he tried again and got in. He got rejected from a Toronto hospital in 1919; he set up his own successful practice in 1920. So it’s not a surprise that Banting did what other scientists and doctors had struggled to do for decades: discovered and refined insulin therapy. His three-person team knew that this treatment was both urgently needed and incredibly tricky to get right; they wanted to make sure the public could access it, and that it was safe. So they made a move for the common good: saying that profit was not their goal, they sold the patent for insulin to the University of Toronto for just $1 each. The University then gave pharmaceutical companies the right to manufacture the drug royalty-free. 
It made sense at the time; Banting and his team were worried that if they didn’t patent the drug at all, drug companies would rush to patent an inferior, possibly dangerous version and try to turn huge profits on it. The thinking seems to have been that if drug companies didn’t have to pay royalties, they would keep prices low. 
The thinking was wrong. Less than thirty years later, drug manufacturer Eli Lilly and Company and two other companies were indicted for an insulin price-fixing scheme. 
But that was only the beginning: in the late seventies, the process for synthetic insulin was perfected, making it far easier and less risky to produce. Since then, prices have been on a sharp uphill climb with no end in sight. 
Insulin is a billion-dollar industry with zero low-priced generic versions on the market. While most name-brand drugs have generic versions that cost less than half the price, insulin is different. Miriam Tucker at Medscape explains : 
Insulin’s Canadian discoverers sold the patent to their university for $1, stating that profit was not their goal. Since then, a series of incremental technological advances have maintained the patents, while older formulations have been pulled from the market. [After] identifying the glucose-lowering substance later known as insulin at the University of Toronto in 1921, Dr Frederick Banting and medical student Charles Best waited 2 years before seeking a patent and then only with the intent of publishing the extraction method, writing: “When the details of the method of preparation are published, anyone would be free to prepare the extract, but no one could secure a profitable monopoly.” 
The next several decades brought successive improvements: adding protamine prolonged insulin’s action, while zinc allowed it to be combined with short-acting insulin in a form patented in 1946 under the name “neutral protamine Hagedorn (NPH),” after its Danish founder. Lente, a slower version without protamine, came along in the mid-1950s. 
These advances allowed for more dose-adjustment options and also extended the patents into the 1970s. Further innovations that improved purity pushed the patents ahead another decade. 
Tucker goes on to quote an article in the New England Journal of Medicine by Jeremy A Greene, MD, PhD, and Kevin R Riggs, MD, MPH: “On the whole, it’s hard to say that contemporary patients who cannot afford their insulin (let alone the patent-protected glucometers and test strips required to adjust the dose) are well served by having as their only option an agent that is marginally more effective than those that could have been generically available 50 or 30 or 10 years ago, had generics manufacturers introduced cheaper versions when patents expired.” 
Greene and Riggs again: 
“The drugs that ultimately see extensive generic competition differ from those that attract few, if any, manufacturers. The history of insulin highlights the limits of generic competition as a public-health framework. Nearly a century after its discovery, there is still no inexpensive supply of insulin for people living with diabetes in North America, and Americans are paying a steep price for the continued rejuvenation of this oldest of modern medicines.” 
Just goes to show: never underestimate what a drug company will do to make money off the backs of researchers who only wanted to help save lives. The Other 98% is a grassroots network of folks committed to kicking greedy corporate asses for the harder working classes. And we have fun doing it. Follow us on social media We Want To:",1

They will scoff, ridicule, mock My Presence, whether this be in My Church, in books; in the Word or when I Am Present in other souls. The Presence of God is Omnipotent and it is felt in the most painful way by those souls who are in darkness. This is why they react with such venom to any mention of Me. These people have a deep ingrained hatred of Me and they fail to see how they can hate someone Who, in their eyes, does not exist.I warn those who embrace false spirituality and who idolize or obsess about anything that does not come from Me. If you open your souls to any spiritual realm, not of My Making, you will open the door to demons, who will cunningly entice you into their dark world. Whatever peace you believe you receive from new age practices will be short-lived. And as you seek more, you will then enter into a state where your conscience will be taken over by those enemies of God, until you are unable to release yourself from their domain. You will never find peace when you idolize false gods.The world is infiltrated with false doctrines, gods and religions. There is only one True God and you can only come to Him by recognising the Great Sacrifice He made when He sent Me, His only Begotten Son, to bring you salvation from the snares of the evil one.To those who do know Me, but who dabble in other doctrines, know this. Should you embrace new age practices, you deny Me. Should My Church acknowledge other creeds, that are not of Me, then they betray Me.The time when My birth is celebrated, by showing allegiance to other religions, that are not of Me, will be one of the greatest betrayals of the Truth.",1

Botox is a toxin, it's not for ""taking care of your skin"". If you want to actually take care of your skin and reduce the appearance of your wrinkles, you should do a deep chemical peel once a year, derma roll every month, and use prescription Retin-A in between those things. Keeping the skin hydrated and nourished with consistent exfoliation is the key to young skin. So vitamin e oil, steam facials and natural moisturizers on the regular. As far as feminism and skincare/plastic surgery, I think it's less a gender issue than a reach to maintain biological attraction. Youth equals fertility, and – because we're animals – to attract a mate, generally it's about how ""fertile"" you appear. Call it peacocking or whatever you will, it's not anti-feminist to care about how you look.﻿",1

So we are prepositioning enough equipment for a Marine Mechanized Task Force of 920 Marines 1000 Km from the Russian Boogie Man's border? Complete with 58 M1A1 MBTs? Talk about a total waste of Taxpayers money. In 2003 45,000 Marines barely made it to Baghdad, 545Kms against almost no opposition. The Marines fought mostly Fedayeen Saddam(determined fanatics yes, but with little or no military training) and prison inmates released once the invasion started (""fight the Americans or we shoot you now""). The Marines never encountered one opposing complete Iraqi Battalion, they did fight Company strength Iraqi Light Infantry 4 times and never came under coordinated Artillery fire. With timid leadership, a inept ability to maneuver off of the Hardball (Main Highway), complete abandonment of Doctrine nearly every ambush (the damn Task Force comes to a 2hr stop so 2 squads can engage 6 Hadjis for 20 minutes) and a real arrogance that precluded using Combat Multipliers (Intel, Artillery, Combat Aviation, SIGINT/ELINT, Civil Affairs or Linguists (3/4s Battalion CO dismounting & having Infantry assault dug-in Fedayeen Saddam in palm groves without preparatory fires while 5 M1s, 2 LAV25s and 8 AAV-7s are walking distance away with 120mm, 25mm, .50cal, and Mk-19s sitting at idle and the 81mm & 120mm mortars are less than 2Km away. Scary to think this Jackwagon is a MG in charge of thousands)The Marines arrived in Baghdad a week late 10 days after Fox and Ghost Troops 2/7CAV occupied the International Terminal at Baghdad Airport.3ID eliminateded 4 complete Divisions and 7 Separate Armored Brigades in active combat destroying 690 MBTs, 1150 AFVs and 1000+ wheeled vehicles. The 1st Marine Division did a excellent job of destroying the 17 Tanks that actually engaged the Marines.The Marines last 35Kms into Baghdad were actually cleared of Iraqi Armor by Fox and Ghost Troops of 2/7 CAV, on their third Thunder Run they turned South on Highway 6 and destroyed 44 Armored vehicles of the 41st Separate Brigade, 3 days before the Marines arrived late.The Marines performance in the CENTCOM operational area hasn't improved much over the last 13 years.Btw I was a 18E assigned as a Arabic IT, physically with 2nd LAR Bn, C Co, so I got to witness the entire 5 Star, 3 Ring Clusterfuck from the tip of the very dull Marine spear.Thats 800Km thru Norwegian Mountain passes and 200 across Europe's biggest swamp(in the Spring, Fall and Summer) or Ice Flat (in Winter) that can support Tanks on three narrow roads.Pretty sure the the Murmansk Military District Commander ISN'T shaking in his boots as he looks out at his 260 Thermobaric MLRS launcher vehicles and 640 T-80 & T-90 MBTs.﻿",1

The Podesta e-mails released by Wikileaks contain various bizarre entries, including an invitation to a ‘Spirit Cooking’ dinner from notorious occultist Marina Abramović. These parties include blood, semen, breast milk … and God knows what else. 
A leaked e-mail reveals that John Podesta was invited to a ‘Spirit Cooking’ dinner by Marina Abramović in 2015. John David Podesta is the Chairman of the 2016 Hillary Clinton presidential campaign. He previously served as Chief of Staff to President Bill Clinton and Counselor to President Barack Obama. Hillary Clinton and John Podesta, 2011. 
– Advertisement – 
Here’s the leaked e-mail. Marina Abramovic sent an e-mail to Tony Podesta (John Podesta’s brother) who then forwarded it to his brother. 
Before going any further, here’s a video of Marina preparing a ‘Spirit Cooking’ ritual. 
Yes, the process involves buckets of congealed pig’s blood. Marina paints on walls instructions coded in classic occultist matter. 
Spirit cooking refers to “a sacrament in the religion of Thelema which was founded by Aleister Crowley” and involves an occult performance during which menstrual blood, breast milk, urine and sperm are used to create a “painting”. 
Strange fact: In another leaked e-mail, Podesta contacts his doctor about an infected finger. Strange coincidence. 
Further in the video, Marina drenches in blood a statue shaped like a small child. Why do I have the sick feeling that actual children might be used during these ceremonies? 
Why would an occultist such as Marina Abramović be in direct and friendly contact with people at the highest levels of power? Because they are all part of the OCCULT ELITE. Marina Abramović 
Marina Abramović is considered to be the “grandmother of performance art”. Most of her work however takes place in private settings where she conducts magick rituals. She is an important and powerful figure in pop culture and is greatly influential in Hollywood, the fashion world and the music business. Marina ‘training’ Lady Gaga in the ‘Abramovic Method’. Marina performing with Jay-Z. 
Marina is an “occult pop culture” icon. Here are symbolic pictures celebrating this fact. On this cover of Vogue Ukraine, Marina represents the stronghold of occultism on the fashion world.

Lindsay Lohan’s Strange Accent: Another Telling Sign of a Mind Control Slave,"Support Us Lindsay Lohan’s Strange Accent: Another Telling Sign of a Mind Control Slave 0 
A video of Lindsay Lohan giving an interview with a strange accent has lead to wild speculation from fans and media. However, to those in the know, this is yet another telling symptom of MK programming, from someone who has already displayed many other symptoms. 
There’s a difference between speaking with a funny accent as a joke and speaking with a completely different speech pattern in all seriousness. One is the result of goofing around and the other is the result an alter-persona. 
– Advertisement – 
Lohan’s new accent was noticed while giving an interview to a reporter in Greece. Here’s the video. 
Lindsay, who is mainly based in England and Greece and was recently in a relationship with a Russian billionaire (MK handler?), was explaining to the journalist about why she has opened up a Nightclub in Athens called Lohan. After a Daily Mail article on the subject, Lohan “joked” and gave her accent (and alter-persona) a name: Lilohan. 
As stated in previous articles, victims of Mind Control are programmed with alter personas that have their own history, identity and accent (read my full article on Monarch Programming here). The programming is so pervasive that the same person can speak different languages with different accents effortlessly – while the core persona cannot. For this reason, the spontaneous yet constant usage of a different accent is one of the main tell-tale signs of MK programming. And Lindsay Lohan has been identified her, on Vigilant Citizen, to be a Beta Kitten slave a long time ago. The entertainment industry has been very keen on proving this fact through symbolic pictures. Lindsay posed countless times as Marilyn Monroe who is the prototype of Beta Kitten Programming. In this photo by Tyler Shields, Lindsay lays on a bed while men get undressed. One cannot come up with a more graphic way of portraying the life of Beta Kitten slaves. Industry slaves must work with creepy photographers such as Terry Richardson. Bonus industry slave sign: One Eye sign. In another shoot with Terry Richardson, Lohan appears genuinely traumatized. 
In past years, Lohan has floated in and out of rehab (aka re-programming) while increasingly appearing to be “out of it”. 
Another famous person who has been displaying the same Beta Kitten symptoms is Britney Spears. Here’s an article about her speaking with a different accent in 2008 – around the time of her infamous head-shaving meltdown. Britney Spears Lapses Into a British Accent 
Britney Spears has a new accessory to go with her pink wig: a British accent. 
In the last several weeks, Spears, 26, has been videotaped numerous times trading her Louisiana twang for U.K. inflections. 
“She had the English accent thing going the whole time” while shopping at Kitson last Thursday, according to a source. “It didn’t stop.” 
Even when angry, the accent appears. On an L.A. shopping trip to Macy’s on Jan. 13, she screamed at the paparazzi, “Get out of my G—— face!” – in a British accent. 
So is it all in fun or has she flipped her pink wig? 
“When someone has dissociative identity disorder” – formerly known as multiple personality disorder – “each identity is split off from the other,” says L.A. psychologist Renee A. Cohen, who is not treating Spears. “Each identity would have its own name, memories, behavioral traits and emotional characteristics.” 
Cohen says the critical question is: “When Britney uses the British accent, or appears to take on another identity, does she know she’s Britney Spears?” 
“Otherwise, she could simply be behaving this way for attention, for sympathy, or any other reason,” adds Cohen. “It’s foolish to attempt to diagnose her without a formal evaluation.” 
One possible influence could be Spears’s maternal grandmother, Lilian Bridges, who was originally from England. 
Also, Spears’s new beau, photographer Adnan Ghalib, grew up in Birmingham, England. 
According to paparazzi who trail the singer around the clock, one thing is for sure: the pink wig means something’s changing. 
“When she puts on the pink wig, you just know something crazy is about to happen,” said one paparazzo.

While media is wondering what kind of accent Lindsay was speaking with (sounds Greek to me), we should rather wonder: Why would a 30 year old woman speak, in all seriousness, with a strange accent and a completely different speech pattern? Most of the time it is the result of a multiple-personality disorder (MPD) – which is a symptom of Monarch mind control. It is there, right in our face, but very few are actually seeing it.",1

BBC’s Children Show ‘Just a Girl’ is About a Transgender Child Taking Hormone Blocking Drugs,"Support Us BBC’s Children Show ‘Just a Girl’ is About a Transgender Child Taking Hormone Blocking Drugs 0 
The BBC series aimed at children as young a six describe how Ben became Amy by taking hormones to halt puberty. It is yet another example of the agenda promoting the blurring of the genders. And they are now aiming children. 
Last year, I published an article entitled The Agenda Behind Bruce Jenner’s Transformation where I explained how Jenner’s sex change was intentionally publicized and celebrated because it was part of a larger agenda promoting the blurring of the genders. This agenda is even more obvious and insidious this year because there’s a conscious effort to reach children. A child with the word ‘Transgender’ stamped across the screen. This sums up what mass media has been about these past years. Although ‘Amy’ is played by an actress, the story claims that she used to be boy named Ben. 
– Advertisement – 
CBBC’s series Just a Girl is the latest baffling attempt at normalizing, trivializing and even celebrating the completely unnecessary process that is childhood sex change. Freely available online on CBBC’s website, the series even teaches children about taking hormones and puberty-halting drugs. Do we truly know the effects of such drugs on one’s developing body and brain chemistry. Of course not. Why is this radical and aberrant process promoted to children? Do children need to know about hormone blockers? AND WHERE ARE THE PARENTS?! 
In my humble opinion, parents who subject their children to radical treatments such as hormone blockers and sex change surgery should be trialed for child abuse. Instead, these things are actually encouraged in shows aimed at children and society is following suit. 
Some NHS clinics (such as the Tavistock Centre in North London) have been prescribing hypothalamic blockers to children as young as nine. In another case, a seven-year-old boy was ordered to be removed from his mother’s care because ‘she was raising him as female’. This is what the elite wants to see: Confused children wondering about their gender. HOW ABOUT YOU GO OUTSIDE AND RIDE A BIKE OR SOMETHING? 
Here are quotes taken from Just a Girl . In Just A Girl, Amy says: ‘When I was born, Mum said Dad was so pleased that he had a boy to take to the football. But Mum knew I was different. She realised early on that I was born in the wrong body.’ She adds: ‘My Mum supported me when I did a PowerPoint presentation to my class about transitioning and that I wasn’t going to come to school in boys’ clothes any more, but girls’ clothes. I wasn’t Ben, I was Amy.’ Later Amy is shown telling a friend, Josh – a boy who wants to be recognised as a girl – that she is on hormone blockers, saying it took ‘ages’ to get them after ‘loads of tests and talks at the clinic’. ‘Once they realised I was trans for real, [I] got them,’ she says. In another entry, Amy tells viewers she has developed a crush on a boy called Liam, but confides: ‘Liam thinks I’m just a girl, but I’m not. I’m trans. And what’s he going to say if he finds out? Stop being my friend? Why? I’m still me, aren’t I?’– Daily Mail, Does your child really need to know how ‘Ben’ became ‘Amy’? Furious parents slam ‘damaging’ BBC sex change show aimed at six-year-olds This last bit appears to be taken straight from a neuro-linguistic programming (NLP) handbook. The goal: To confuse young minds about sex and gender. Backlash 
The show was accused by several groups of ‘sowing the seeds of confusion’. Norman Wells, director of the Family Education Trust, said: 
‘The more we promote the idea that a boy can be born into a girl’s body and a girl can be born into a boy’s body, and that drugs and surgery can put things right, the more children will become utterly confused. Respecting and preserving a child’s birth sex should be seen as a child protection issue. It is irresponsible of the BBC to introduce impressionable children as young as six to the idea that they can choose to be something other than their biological sex.’’– Ibid. 
The BBC defended its series, releasing a statement which claimed the program dealt with “universal themes that many children relate to”. 
“Just a Girl is about a fictional transgender character trying to, make sense of the world, deal with bullying and work out how to keep her friends, which are universal themes that many children relate to, and which has had a positive response from our audience. 
“CBBC aims to reflect true life to our audience, providing content that mirrors the lives of as many UK children as possible – you only have to look at programmes such as The Dumping Ground or our BAFTA winning and ground-breaking transgender story ‘I am Leo’ to see that is the case.” 
The BBC mentions I Am Leo which is another CBBC production. It is a documentary following a 13-year old teen’s process to become a boy. Leo (born Lily) is one of the youngest children in the UK to be given hormone therapy. 
In short, the BBC and the rest of mass media are fully committed in pushing the gender blurring agenda to children before they even reach puberty.",1
‘Conspiracy Theorist’ Max Spiers Found Dead Days After Texting His Mother to Investigate if Anything ‘Happened to Him’,"Support Us ‘Conspiracy Theorist’ Max Spiers Found Dead Days After Texting His Mother to Investigate if Anything ‘Happened to Him’ 0 
British conspiracy theorist and UFO expert Max Spiers was found dead on a sofa after vomiting ‘black liquid’. This happened only days after texting his mother about investigating if something happened to him. 
Max Spiers, a 39-year-old father of two was found dead on a sofa in Poland, where he was invited to speak on conspiracy theories and UFOs. This happened in July and, since then, no post-mortem examination were carried out on his body. The death was ruled to be from ‘natural causes’.

Days before his death, Spiers texted his mom: 
“Your boy’s in trouble. If something happens to me, investigate”. 
Spiers, who claimed to be a survivor of a secret government ‘super soldier’ program, died suddenly after vomiting ‘black liquid’. His mother Vanessa Bates, an English teacher, told journalists: 
“He was making a name for himself in the world of conspiracy theorists and had been invited to speak at a conference in Poland in July. He was staying with a woman who he had not known for long and she told me how she found him dead on the sofa. But I think Max had been digging in some dark places and I fear that somebody wanted him dead.”– The Telegraph, UFO expert Max Spiers’ death prompts conspiracy theories 
Bates believes that Spiers might have been poisoned. 
“Max was a very fit man who was in good health. All I have is a death certificate from the Polish authorities that it was from natural causes, but no post-mortem was done so how can they tell that? 
They are also refusing to release any paperwork about it to me because, absurdly, I don’t have his written permission. 
He has a brother, Josh, and sister, Becky, who are both devastated, as are his two boys. We all want answers to this and I will continue to fight to get to the truth.”– Ibid. 
Spiers’ financé Sarah Adams told Yahoo! News that he was about to expose ‘black magic’ and well known politicians and celebrities. “We were used to getting death threats or stuff like that from people but I think this time it seemed rather real. He’d been sent threats saying that him and me were going to die. He was going to expose black magic. He was going to expose some of the stuff that he was working on involving political leaders and celebrities. He planned on coming back here seeing his family and I was going to have his child. He had messaged me hours before. It definitely couldn’t have been anything like suicide or something like that.”– Yahoo! News, Here’s what conspiracy theorist Max Spiers was about to reveal before his death North East Kent coroner’s office said that an investigation into Mr Spiers’ death was in its “very early” stages. Was Spiers’ poisoned because he knew too much? Was he about to say too much? One thing is for sure, this death cannot be more suspicious.",1

Why Comey Reopened the Hillary Investigation (The real reasons),"Posted 10/31/2016 10:54 am by PatriotRising with 0 comments 
This last Friday it became public record that FBI Director James Comey reopened the Hillary Clinton email server investigation after repeatedly testifying before Congress and the world up to last July that he’d closed the case , after in his words not finding sufficient evidence of “any criminal wrongdoing ” to indict her in spite of her four years as Secretary of State egregiously breaching our national security , committing obstruction of justice and willful tampering with evidence, deleting 30,000 emails after receiving a court subpoena constituting destruction of evidence, not to mention repeatedly engaging in perjury before Congress and the FBI. 

But obviously, a federal investigation still in process in late June never stopped serial rapist-crime boss Bill Clinton’s illegal ambush at the Phoenix airport of Comey’s boss US Attorney General Loretta Lynch “clearing” the way for Hillary to proceed without consequence to be anointed as the next US figurehead puppet president by the ruling elite. Because it’s so blatantly obvious to the entire world that Hillary is guilty as sin, Comey’s whitewash didn’t go over well with either Americans or longtime FBI agents who reacted angrily to Comey’s over-the-top corruption. Subsequently, in recent months Comey has had a virtual mutiny on his hands as in the FBI boss has lost all credibility, respect, and moral authority. 

A former federal attorney for the District of Columbia Joe diGenova spelled it all out in a WMAL radio interview last Friday just hours after the news was released that Comey had sent a letter informing Congress that the case is being reopened. DiGenova said that with an open revolt brewing inside the FBI, Comey was forced to go public on Friday with reopening the investigation. The former DC attorney added that the FBI investigators discovered more emails on a phone confiscated from the former New York Congressman and separated husband Anthony Weiner that also included his wife and longtime Hillary’s right-hand woman Huma Abedin’s communications that allegedly bear pertinent relevance to the Hillary case. Funny how things have a karmic way of coming full circle – the Clintons first introduced Weiner and Abedin 15 years ago and they married a half dozen years ago. 

In a separate FBI investigation involving Weiner’s alleged sexting messages with a 15-year old minor , the phone in question was handed over to the FBI. The investigating teams of both the Weiner and Hillary cases compared notes and apparently additional emails not already issued by WikiLeaks or already in FBI possession recently came to light on Weiner’s phone . The legions of rank and file FBI agents were already fuming over Comey’s complete ethical and legal lapses in his choice not to indict Hillary. Joe diGenova believes that FBI personnel forced Comey’s hand to reopen the investigation after giving him the ultimatum that if he failed to do so, the FBI defiantly would. According to diGenova, this latest plot twist only proves that: 

The original investigation was not thorough, and that it was an incompetent investigation. 

Otherwise, had a real investigation been conducted, that Weiner phone used by both Anthony and Huma would have been picked up by the FBI and its contents thoroughly scrutinized long before now. 

In addition to stating the obvious, that the higher-up feds had already made the decision to not consequence Hillary for her crimes, speculating on why that phone was not already submitted to the FBI as evidence, the former DC attorney concluded: 

There could be one explanation: Huma Abedin may have denied that any other phone existed, and if she did, she committed a felony. She lied to the FBI just like General Cartwright , and if she did, she’s dead meat, and Comey knows it, and there’s nothing he can do about it. 

Finally, diGenova dropped one more bombshell in Friday’s interview. An inside source has revealed to him that the laptops belonging to key Clinton aides Cheryl Mills and Heather Samuelson, both wrongly granted immunity , were not destroyed after all as previously reported, but have been secretly kept intact by investigating FBI agents refusing to destroy incriminating evidence as part of the in-house whitewash. Additionally like their boss, Hillary’s aides also sent classified material using private servers. On top of that, longtime aide Cheryl Mills on multiple occasions has perjured herself lying under oath for the Clinton crime family, tasked with “cleaning up” (aka covering up) their countless scandals over the past several decades. Indeed the whole Clinton entourage not already “mysteriously” winding up in the growing Clinton dead pool are all unindicted criminals protected by the corrosively corrupt DC cronyism where backroom deals (a la Bill’s airport ambush) are brokered based on whatever dirt’s been gathered and used as bargaining blackmail chips against all parties involved. That’s how the Washington crowd stays immune from any and all accountability as well as stays alive. Violate that crime syndicate code of conduct and you lose your life as more recent victims earlier this year have. 

In a “leaked” memo to his FBI that surfaced on Fox Friday night, Comey outlined his reasons for reopening the case in light of the new information the director believes would have ultimately been leaked to Congress and the public anyway. So in full damage control/CYA mode, the beleaguered director now going public really had no choice in the matter. His underlings were chomping at the bit to both out and oust him. In an obvious attempt to weakly claim some moral high ground, Comey wrote in his memo: 

I also think it would be misleading to the American people were we not to supplement the record. 

Though his leadership and character are perceived by the vast majority of both FBI personnel as well as American citizens to presently lay in ruin as a pathetically shameful stain and humiliating joke on both the FBI organization and Washington in general, James Comey appears to be feebly attempting to save his own career and reputation for appearing now to “come clean.” But make no mistake, his moral turpitude displayed throughout this Hillary debacle from early 2015 to now has over-exposed him as a total lackey and fraud, so at this late stage of the game, redemption is not even an option. But the criminal misconduct, rampant corruption and diabolical evil committed by those at the highest puppet levels of federal power, and especially the elite puppet masters controlling them, their sins produce far more devastating consequences than this morally lacking man in the middle of this latest controversy. 

Because there is no way that the FBI will properly conclude this part 2 of the Hillary investigation saga before the November 8 th election, Hillary, and her Democrats are predictably crying foul , demanding that the FBI immediately disclose what it has, which of course is a moot point that won’t happen. It seems highly unlikely that the email texts from Abedin and Weiner found on his phone would not contain clear criminal evidence that implicates Hillary. Since Hillary was the globalist choice after Obama was selected in 2008, it seems unlikely that the puppet masters would not permit this latest development to even occur. But then perhaps the ruling elite is pulling the plug on Hillary, concluding that she simply carries too much liability baggage with her deteriorating health condition and never-ending scandals, maybe the globalists are rethinking an alternative replacement like her obnoxiously aggressive VP candidate, the Jesuit-trained and educated Tim Kaine. 

That said, there are some cynics who believe that this recent odd turn is the last ditch desperado attempt being staged to overturn Trump winning by a landslide. This conjectured scenario goes something like this: a few days prior to the election the FBI will once again “clear” Hillary of all charges. This, in turn, would offer her the last minute much needed boost being able to cash in on her worn out persecution complex , plagued forever by her “right wing conspiracy” theory against the “much maligned” woman of destiny. 

In response to all her scandals, Hillary’s M.O. has always been to falsely blame some villainous sinister force. This year it’s been Putin hacking into her emails, and Trump, Putin, and Assange colluding and plotting behind her back. She’s always been as paranoid as Richard Nixon , attempting to deflect the heat she draws from her own skullduggery lies by constantly pointing fingers to externalize blame onto others. It’s a deeply rooted pathological complex that certain tightly screwed sociopaths possess. 

This latest sudden turn of events obviously has James Comey incurring the wrath of Hillary Democrats as well as the Justice Department. By disclosing the reopened investigation so close to the election date that undoubtedly casts some influence on the potential outcome, Comey is defying his AG boss while clearly violating DOJ written policy . Lynch herself even tried to quash Comey’s letter to Congress. But as diGenova alluded, by Comey’s own past misdeeds (and those of his boss and Obama as well), the FBI director placed himself between this rock and a hard place by his own slipshod, half-ass probe failing to acquire Weiner’s phone the first time around. 

The entire sordid affair of this year’s totally rigged political election – pre-fixed in Hillary’s favor – blatantly reveals to America the gross misnomer of the US “justice” system being two-tiered, one for elitist crime cabal bosses like Hillary and the other for the rest of us 99% no longer protected in a totalitarian police state by our once rule of law the US Constitution. Regardless of what happens in the future, the truth genie’s already been let out of the bag, and for eyes open enough to see, it’s floating in the Washington cesspool of filth, debauchery and deception regularly perpetrated by our “entrusted perps” we have as our so called leaders. 

Moreover, this year’s unending batches of Wiki-leaked DNC/Hillary emails and Project Veritas undercover campaign videos confirm that the entire US political, as well as economic system, is morally and financially bankrupt, irreparably broken and in need of complete overhaul. Voter fraud and election fraud are rampant. Soros funded electronic voting machines that are preprogrammed to vote for Hillary are operating in 16 key battleground states. America’s internal house now is in total disarray, badly in need of a deep cleaning purge like never before. Mainstream media is strongly biased against Trump in its blind support for Hillary . As Secretary of State she treasonously sold out our nation, placing us all at high security risk and under foreign interest control at the hands of high rolling bidders so she and her fat cats can get richer as fellow partners-in-crime from places like Saudi Arabia and Israel, destroying our once sovereign country while aiding, abetting, financing and supporting our enemies the global terrorists around the world. She helped create ISIS and plans world war against Russia, China and Iran. The traitors in our government and their globalist puppet masters – the Rothschilds, Rockefellers , the Bushes and Clintons all need to be rounded up, imprisoned and tried at The Hague for both treason and their endless crimes against humanity.

Watchdog Alleges Virginia Prepping for Mass Fraud…,"Posted 10/31/2016 3:41 pm by PatriotRising with 0 comments Officials stockpile a million provisional ballots in swing state governed by a close Clinton ally 

Virginia has printed 1 million provisional ballots, an unprecedented number that could allow a large number of previously disqualified felons to cast ballots for president in the potentially crucial swing state. 

So says Reagan George, the president of the Virginia Voters Alliance. 

George, a conservative election watchdog, charged on Monday that the Virginia Department of Elections is overpreparing for worst-case scenarios and increasing the likelihood of illegal votes being cast. In reply to Republican complaints earlier this month, Virginia Department of Elections Commissioner Edgardo Cortés acknowledged officials are preparing for all contingencies, according to the Richmond Times-Dispatch. 

But George said the provisional ballot printing doesn’t make sense even for contingencies. And it doesn’t compare to demand in 2012. 

“The claim that it is for contingency planning is bogus,” George said in an email. “In 2012, Stafford County used less than 500 provisional ballots — in 2016 they received 30,000. In 2012, Loudoun County used 700 provisional ballots. In 2016, they received 84,000. In 2012, Fairfax used 2,500 provisional ballots; in 2016, they received over 265,000. This is ridiculous.” 
But spokeswoman Dena Potter of the Virginia Department of Elections said the state is trying to accommodate a court order. 

“As part of its emergency preparedness efforts and in response to the [December] 2015 consent decree related to mitigating long lines at the polls, the Department issued guidance to local registrars on August 29, 2016, that included having enough provisional ballot envelopes to equal at least 20 percent of the number of active voters as of September 1,” Potter said in an email. “As of September 30, there were 5.5 million voters registered in Virginia. As with any contingency planning, we hope that we don’t have to use these but they will be available in case we do.” 

The decision to print so many provisional ballots comes after an April announcement by Gov. Terry McAuliffe, a Democrat and a key ally of Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton. McAuliffe said he would allow more than 200,000 released felons to vote on Nov. 8. 

The decision immediately brought a legal challenge from the Republicans, who won their suit in July. Virginia law says the governor must individually clear such cases, and cannot widely add so many released felons back to the voter rolls. 

George believes the court loss is part of the thinking behind the surge in provisional ballots. The thousands of felons who signed up to vote after McAuliffe’s order were initially welcomed to the voter rolls. George said left-wing voter groups were ready for the order, and signed up thousands of felons within hours. 

If those felons now walk into a polling place and demand a ballot, they will be accommodated, George charged. George also said he is concerned other ineligible voters will be handed such provisional ballots simply if they demand them. 
Provisional ballots are only counted by city and county election boards after Nov. 8, and Republicans should be prepared for things to go against them, George said. Each board has a Republican and a Democrat, and an McAuliffe appointee. 

“Guess which way the vote is going to go,” said George. 

Virginia leaders have been dealing with election headaches for months. On Oct. 13, Virginia legislators questioned Cortes at a hearing. One Republican leader, citing election problems, called for Cortés to resign, according to the Times-Dispatch. 

“I think it’s incumbent upon the governor to replace you quickly with competent and nonpartisan leadership,” said Delegate Timothy Hugo, R-Fairfax.",1
"Carville Melts Down: Asserts FBI, GOP and KGB in Cahoots","Posted 10/31/2016 3:17 pm by PatriotRising with 0 comments Democratic strategist calls reopened Clinton probe an ‘attack’ on American democracy in MSNBC tantrum 
Famed Democratic strategist James Carville may be the first Clinton surrogate to have officially lost his mind over the FBI’s decision to reopen its investigation into Clinton’s private email server. 

In an appearance on MSNBC on Monday, Carville relentlessly — and repeatedly — attacked the FBI’s decision to reopen the investigation into Hillary Clinton, asserting it is part of a conspiracy to subvert American democracy. 

“This is in effect an attempt to hijack an election,” Carville claimed. “It’s unprecedented … the House Republicans and the KGB are trying to influence our democracy,” he said. 

Apparently the fact that the Soviet security agency was disbanded in 1991 does not preclude its involvement in this vast, anti-Clinton conspiracy organized by the FBI, according to Carville. Poor Carville was clearly apoplectic at the news of Comey’s announcement, describing it as an assault or attack on American democracy multiple times. 

He was also adamant about who was responsible. “Comey was acting in concert and coordination with the House Republicans,” Carville said. “We also have the extraordinary case of the KGB being involved in this race and selectively leaking things from the Clinton campaign that they hacked,” he claimed. 
Carville was very upset that Comey’s announcement thrust Clinton’s surely unethical and likely illegal behavior back into the spotlight. “It would seem to me that the FBI shouldn’t be getting rolled by the House Republicans, that’s what happened here — there’s nothing else that’s going on — and in the meantime … democracy is under assault by the KGB,” he said. “To me that’s something we ought to be talking about.” 

Unfortunately for Carville, whilst fanciful tales about time-traveling Soviet spies and an FBI on the GOP’s take certainly make for interesting entertainment, they pale in importance to the real life stories of Clinton’s brazen lawlessness. 
When the MSNBC anchor dared raise the fact that Democrats were praising Comey only a few months ago when he announced the FBI’s decision not to recommend indictment, Carville went into a stuttering, sputtering fit. Hillary Reboots ‘Vast Right-Wing Conspiracy’ Playbook Clinton camp set to wage effort to discredit FBI Director Comey and criminal probe as politically motivated 

“When the facts change I change my mind,” Carville said. “Why are you defending this, why are you sitting here as American democracy is under assault?” he asked angrily. Faced with the Democrats’ clear double standard 

“This is an unprecedented event that was done on behalf of the House Republicans,” Carville repeated. “And as we know the KGB is all over this election and this is what we are talking about? We ought to be talking about our democracy is under assault right now and what we are going to do about it, not [what somebody said in July] about James Comey.”",1
Immigration Officer: Border Deluge of Illegal Aliens ‘Is The Worst We’ve Ever Seen’,"Posted 10/31/2016 3:10 pm by PatriotRising with 0 comments The flood of illegal aliens pouring across the southern border has become a “crisis situation” and is even worse than the record 2014 border surge, says an Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) officer from El Paso, Texas with more than ten years of service to the agency. 

The ICE agency has no room to house the arriving surge, so many illegals are being released into American communities where they disappear “into the wind never to be seen by us again,” the agent said. 

The agent—who spoke to Breitbart News exclusively on the condition of anonymity for fear of retaliation by the administration—detailed how his overrun agency has been forced to pull agents from their mission of removing criminal aliens from the nation’s interior, so that they can help process the cross-border influx of illegal aliens. 

The illegal aliens, mostly from Central America, are using President Barack Obama’s policies to request asylum, work permits and green cards. Whereas unlawful aliens traditionally sought to evade border agents in hopes of reaching U.S. cities where they could illegally fill American jobs, reports document how many of these new migrants are now turning themselves in to border patrol agents believing they’ll be allowed to stay permanently. This 2016 influx of migrants from Central America had exceeded 117,000 by Oct. 1, marking a new record, Breitbart News reported . 

Many additional thousands of illegal aliens continue to pour across the border via smuggling routes that try to bypass the border patrol. In the 12 months up to October 2016, 271,000 illegal immigrants were caught trying to sneak across the border—but many others escaped arrest and made their way to U.S. workplaces and cities. 

ICE is the agency responsible for enforcing federal immigration law by identifying and removing illegal aliens within the interior of the nation, as well as removing aliens apprehended at the border by border patrol. After an alien is apprehended by border patrol, the alien is then turned over to ICE, which processes and detains the alien. 
Although the surge has been largely ignored by corporate media and unacknowledged by the administration, “the public’s safe is in jeopardy,” the agent warned. Migrants with histories of prior criminal offenses, plus “would-be perpetrators or terrorists whose intent is to harm Americans or our country as a whole” could be among those being released from ICE’s custody, the agent said. 

The officer said he believes the reason corporate media refuse to cover the crisis is because “it’s an election year and [the media] have a politically-driven agenda. I don’t know why else it wouldn’t be covered—this is the worst we’ve ever seen it,” the agent said: 

This is a crisis situation that is not being acknowledged by the administration or the media. I know we had a crisis situation in 2014, but this has this by far surpassed that. Our officers are overworked and overrun. We have had to move several officers from our interior enforcement programs in order to address and assist the officers who have to process all of the illegal border crossers and who are getting hammered by the crisis we’re facing down here. 

“The safety of the American public is at risk,” the officer warned. 

Would-be perpetrators have much more of a chance to make it through the system and into our communities. That’s a huge concern for us. I don’t understand why the administration and the media are not recognizing this as a crisis because that’s what it is. By removing officers from enforcement programs, the threat to the American public has increased exponentially… However many officers we move from enforcement programs to help address this crisis means that there are that many fewer people trying to find criminal aliens, and that poses a threat to public safety. It’s infringing upon our efforts to keep the American public safe. 

“In my book, if we miss one criminal alien who goes not to victimize one American citizen, that’s one too many,” the agent said. “But with the scale we’re talking about here, it’s likely lots of criminal aliens will to be able to slip through the system. So many Americans could potentially be affected by this.” 

However, the agent’s view does not seem to be shared by many lawmakers. For instance, both Tim Kaine and Hillary Clinton have shunned the American victims of illegal alien crime. Similarly, Republican House Speaker Paul Ryan, who last year voted to grant federal funding to Sanctuary Cities, literally fled from grieving mothers, who were forced to bury their children as a result of open borders, as they sought to give him a letter begging him to enforce the nation’s immigration laws. 

“There are lots of aliens we should be removing, but we can’t do it because we’re handcuffed by policies,” the agent explained. “The surge is worse than it was in 2014. Our southern border is not secure. It’s so porous. We have people working seven days a week just meet the demand and workload that’s being created by this administration’s policies.” 

“The administration’s policies have created the influx and the crisis situation because people overrun our border knowing they have a chance to stay,” the officer said. “The workload, the number of people, we’ve had to deal with has by far surpassed any amount we’ve ever had to handle before. 

“The Office of Refugee Resettlement is at capacity. The continued influx is going to put us way over capacity,” the officer explained. “Once they’re processed, we have to either find placement for them or release them, and right now we don’t have any place to put them… If we have nowhere to house them, they’re going to be released into the public—hundreds of bodies will be released.” 

The officer continued: 

In just the past two days alone we’re talking in the neighborhood of 200 bodies or more that we need to either find placement for or that will be released from our custody. This figure doesn’t include all of the other people that we have yet to process—at ports of entry they have close to 500 aliens to process who have yet to come into our custody. I’m hearing that they’re even pulling border patrol agents to assist them because they don’t have enough to keep up with processing all of the aliens. 

“And mind you,” the officer added, “that figure is just the number of people that come over as a family unit—this doesn’t include the unaccompanied children or illegal adults who cross the border.” 

This is significant because Hillary Clinton has pledged to “end family detention and close private immigrant detention centers.” 

“Hillary believes we should end family detention for parents and children who arrive at our border in desperate situations. We have alternatives to detention for those who pose no flight or public safety risk, such as supervised release,” reads Clinton’s campaign website. 

The agent described such a proposal as “ridiculous” and dangerous—as her plan could enable criminal aliens to enter the country and victimize innocent Americans. “If we think we have a mass migration problem now, and she’s trying to propose something like that, it’s only going to further overrun our borders and our officers,” the agent said. 

“Does she propose we just release them?” the agent asked. “It sounds like she wants to create just another avenue for criminal aliens to re-enter the country and commit more crimes, and victimize more people while they’re here… Her proposal seems pretty far-fetched and seems to lack any knowledge of what the real issues are… There have been many instances where the men that we’re processing, who arrive with their family unit, have some criminal offenses in their history—is she proposing that we not investigate that?” 

In September, the National ICE Council, which represents the nation’s roughly 5,000 frontline ICE officers, agents, and personnel endorsed Donald Trump over Clinton and “urged all Americans, especially the millions of lawful immigrants living within our country, to support Donald J. Trump, and to protect American jobs, wages and lives.” The endorsement marked the ICE Council’s first-ever endorsement of any candidate for any elected office. 

In a statement announcing the endorsement, the council’s president warned against Clinton’s “radical plan” of “total amnesty plus open borders” that “would result in the loss of innocent American lives, mass victimization and death for many attempting to immigrate to the United States, the total gutting of interior enforcement, the handcuffing of ICE officers, and uncontrollable flood of illegal immigrants across U.S. borders.” The ICE Council president warned that the agenda of non-enforcement, favored by Clinton, “results in the daily loss of life.”",1

Like any other economic good, the value of a higher education degree is determined on the market, at the intersection of the subjective valuations and appraisements of those constituting the supply and demand of that particular good. The parties interested in these transactions are not just education providers and students, but also—or even primarily—employers looking to hire graduates into their companies. At least, that’s how things should be, with entrepreneurs at the forefront, driving and shaping up the content and quality of the education and training of their future employees. 

But with the government interfering now for decades with this precarious balance, it is not unexpected to find that the essential link which allowed the market to work efficiently has been fractured. The result is that higher education degrees no longer hold any value for employers. 

Recent evidence suggests that in the UK, for example, a record number of university graduates— one in four —face only a choice between unemployment and taking a job that does not require a degree. This shows that their degrees are not demanded on the market or, alternatively, that young people are malinvesting high student loans into degrees which, once obtained, will not offer them better employment alternatives than before—thus having a rate of return too low to justify the initial investment. Similarly, an investigation by The Economist has revealed that worldwide, BAs, BSCs, but also master programs such as MBAs are no longer considered to offer a candidate a competitive edge in the marketplace. 

Another facet of the devaluation of higher education is the record high number of specialised degrees, a trend which began with masters and MBAs, but has now peaked into PhDs.The mismatch between supply and demand (academic positions) is even wider in this case. A 2013 paper published in Nature Biotechnology has found that “Each year, there are seven times more PhDs awarded in science and engineering than there are newly available faculty positions.” In fact, the authors show that 

Since 1982, almost 800,000 PhDs were awarded in science and engineering (S&E) fields, whereas only about 100,000 academic faculty positions were created in those fields within the same time frame. The number of S&E PhDs awarded annually has also increased over this time frame, from ~19,000 in 1982 to ~36,000 in 2011. The number of faculty positions created each year, however, has not changed, with roughly 3,000 new positions created annually. 

A part of these graduates, especially in economics, end up working for the government when they eventually fail the market test. But the trend is also extending further to postdoctoral fellowships, which are sought after by the 70% of PhDs unable to find alternative employment. 

Taking the government out of higher education and letting universities compete in providing market-relevant, profitable degrees is only one part of the solution. The market for education won’t be entirely healthy until the government is also taken out of primary, secondary, and high school curricula and finances, allowing parents and pupils to become informed consumers of education and good judges of their investments.

Heh : Hillary Literally Became the Definition of ‘Pathological Lying’ on Google Yesterday,"Posted 10/31/2016 2:37 pm by PatriotRising with 0 comments Clinton image added to “Pathological lying” Wikipedia page 
If you had happened to Google the term ‘pathological lying’ on Sunday evening, you would have been met with none other than the bright, smiling face of presidential hopeful Hillary Clinton. Before Wikipedia administrators put a temporary lock on the entry early Monday morning, the top Google result for the term was a link to the Wiki article displaying Clinton’s photo, along with the following quote defining pathological lying: 

“It is a stand-alone disorder as well as a symptom of other disorders such as psychopathy and antisocial, narcissistic, and histrionic personality disorders, but people who are pathological liars may not possess characteristics of the other disorders. Excessive lying is a common symptom of several mental disorders.” 

The revision history of the entry shows the picture of Clinton was originally added to the ‘pathological lying’ Wikipedia article on the morning of October 29th, but it wasn’t until the next night that the ever-vigilant internet community took notice and excitedly spread the word on Facebook and Twitter . Check out the Google Trends report for ‘pathological lying’ below: 
Unsurprisingly, most reactions were supportive of the alteration to the Wikipedia article, once again showing the public’s general distrust of the presidential candidate. A poll conducted by Quinnipiac University last year asked voters to say the first thing that came to mind when they thought of Hillary Clinton. The most popular response was “liar,” followed by “dishonest” and “untrustworthy.” Maybe if the biggest names in journalism weren’t outright colluding with Hillary’s campaign , that poll would have been more widely reported. Maybe. 

Due to the fact major media corporations are completely ignoring the corruption surrounding the Clinton campaign, it has been left to Wikileaks, independent media outlets, and the social media community to push this information into the public eye. Just a week away from the election, new evidence was discovered that prompted the FBI to announce they have reopened the criminal investigation into Hillary’s private email server. 

With Republican nominee Donald Trump scheduled to appear in court to face rape allegations, there is a high possibility the next president of the United States will be facing criminal charges before they’re even inaugurated. If nothing else, this election cycle is proving that people want truth — and they’ll get creative to expose it. Do you enjoy reading Patriot Rising?",1
Leaked Images Show Illegals Casually Strolling Across Open Border,"Posted 10/31/2016 2:31 pm by PatriotRising with 0 comments A series of leaked images reveal how groups of illegal immigrants continue to flow over the Texas border in unprecedented numbers. The lack of physical barrier and real border security allows human smugglers and their cargo to simply wade across the shallow waters of the Rio Grande. 

Breitbart Texas exclusively obtained leaked law enforcement images of a crossing attempt by human smugglers in an area between Del Rio and Laredo, Texas. According to various sources on both sides of the border, the area where the crossing took place is under the control of the Los Zetas cartel . 

The black and white images were taken using night vision equipment in order to record the smuggling operations. The images reveal that human smugglers appear to operate with little concern due to the lack of presence by U.S. law enforcement. 
The human smugglers can be seen driving in SUVs to the Mexican side of the river before disembarking. The illegal immigrants then hoist their belongings over their heads and proceed to wade through the water onto the U.S. side of the border where more human smugglers await. 
Border Patrol Agent Shawn Moran, speaking to Breitbart Texas in his role as National Border Patrol Council Vice President, cautioned that many would assume the fact that technology identified these unknown aliens crossing does not mean they were apprehended. 

Agent Moran stated, “We have a manpower shortage and have seen instances where were could only respond to 40 percent of the crossings we knew were occurring. The technology is great at letting us know a crossing is occurring, but what good is it if we don’t have the agents to respond.” 
A recent report from Breitbart Texas showed illegal immigrants crossing the border from Mexico and entering the U.S. inside the city limits of Laredo, Texas. In that case, the foreigners were able to overcome U.S. border security with nothing more than a breaststroke and a cheap inner tube . 
As Breitbart Texas recently reported, the numbers of illegal immigrant families and unaccompanied minors crossing the border from Mexico are up dramatically in the federal Fiscal Year 2016. The apprehension of families has increased by 95 percent over FY 2015 numbers to 77,674 according to a report from U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP). The number of Unaccompanied Alien Children (UAC) crossing the border hit a near record total of 59,692. According to a previous Breitbart Texas report, the numbers of illegal immigrants have been dramatically increasing in the three months leading up to the election.

Trump: I’d Get ‘Electric Chair’ for Cheating on Debates Like Hillary,"Posted 10/31/2016 2:03 pm by PatriotRising with 0 comments Republican nominee Donald Trump told an audience of roughly 8,000 cheering fans that if he had cheated in presidential debates the way rival Hillary Clinton had, he would be sent to the “electric chair.” 

Trump was commenting on the revelation by Wikileaks on Monday that CNN commentator Donna Brazile, who is now the chair of the Democratic National Committee, had been caught again passing debate questions from the network to the Clinton campaign during the Democratic primary. 

Brazile had been exposed earlier doing the same — passing a question to the Clinton campaign in advance of a town hall debate against Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT). 

At the time, Brazile was not yet DNC chair, but was a regular CNN contributor. 

CNN fired Brazile on Monday, releasing a statement: ““We are completely uncomfortable with what we have learned about her interactions with the Clinton campaign while she was a CNN contributor.” 

Trump noted that Brazile was not the core issue — “I don’t care” about her, he said. Rather, he argued, Hillary Clinton should have reported Brazile the first time she tried to pass debate questions to her. 
Trump also talked about cheating at the polls, telling supporters that the only way to overcome voter fraud would be to vote by the “millions.” 

He cited 1.8 million dead people on the country’s voter rolls, and 2.75 million who are registered in more than one state. (The statistics appear to be based on a Pew Research Center study.) 

Trump challenged journalists in the room to ask Hillary Clinton why she had not reported Brazile after being provided with the debate questions.

AG Lynch told FBI Director Comey NOT to go public with the new Clinton email investigation,"Posted 10/31/2016 1:28 pm by PatriotRising with 0 comments 
According to a report in the New Yorker, James Comey, Big Kahuna of the FBI, went full-on cowboy in releasing details of the new Clinton email inquiry. Apparently, the Department of Justice advised him not to release the information just days before the presidential election. 

Gosh. I wonder if the same advice would have been given if it was Donald Trump who was being investigated by the FBI. 

Comey explained his decision in a letter to FBI employees : 

“We don’t ordinarily tell Congress about ongoing investigations, but here I feel an obligation to do so given that I testified repeatedly in recent months that our investigation was completed. I also think it would be misleading to the American people were we not to supplement the record.” 

The DoJ – and by DoJ I mean Attorney General Loretta Lynch, who famously had a secret meeting on an airport tarmac with Bill Clinton to talk about her non-existent grandchildren – is implying that Comey is not playing fair and that the move is inconsistent with the rules which have been designed to make it seem like they are not interfering in an election. 

Here’s Comey’s letter to the Senate Judiciary Committee: 
Really? 

The DoJ thinks that the public shouldn’t know that the person they may be voting for is being investigated by the FBI? 

That’s the most absurd thing I have heard for quite some time, and considering this election, that’s really saying something. 

This is from the New Yorker report, emphasis mine. 

On Friday, James Comey, the director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, acting independently of Attorney General Loretta Lynch , sent a letter to Congress saying that the F.B.I. had discovered e-mails that were potentially relevant to the investigation of Hillary Clinton’s private server. Coming less than two weeks before the Presidential election, Comey’s decision to make public new evidence that may raise additional legal questions about Clinton was contrary to the views of the Attorney General, according to a well-informed Administration official. Lynch expressed her preference that Comey follow the department’s longstanding practice of not commenting on ongoing investigations, and not taking any action that could influence the outcome of an election, but he said that he felt compelled to do otherwise . 

Comey’s decision is a striking break with the policies of the Department of Justice, according to current and former federal legal officials. Comey, who is a Republican appointee of President Obama, has a reputation for integrity and independence, but his latest action is stirring an extraordinary level of concern among legal authorities, who see it as potentially affecting the outcome of the Presidential and congressional elections. ( source ) 

Is this investigation the iceberg to HRC’s Titanic campaign? 

Hillary Clinton has said she finds the development “unprecedented and deeply troubling.” (source ) 

Oh, I’ll bet she does. 

I’ll bet if Trump had been the target of the investigation she would have been up on the stage, gripping the podium to stay upright, saying how wonderful it was that Comey decided to break the news so that voters could be aware that they might be voting for someone who was suspected of having broken federal laws. I’ll bet she’d be saying that the public has a right to know if a candidate was under investigation. I’ll bet she’d take the high road and say that those elected to the office of President of the United States have to be above and beyond reproach. 

Of course, when it’s her, things are a little different, aren’t they? 

We do have a right to know. We absolutely have a right to know that a person who could be elected to know all of the secrets was careless when she only knew some of the secrets. It seems like a no-brainer that the public should know that a candidate is being investigated for a second time for being criminally negligent with information entrusted to her. 

And the fact that we know has severely damaged Clinton’s campaign. Although previous polls were incredibly skewed to the point of being outright fake , it looks like the mainstream is now trying to save face with a new batch of polls. A poll from ABC news and the Washington Post , both hotbeds of liberal voters, has shown that her lead has dropped to within a single point over Donald Trump due to the Clinton email scandal. 

“About a third of likely voters say they’re less likely to support Clinton given FBI Director James Comey’s disclosure Friday that the bureau is investigating more emails related to its probe of Clinton’s use of a private email server while secretary of state. “ 

Finally, some people are actually paying attention to the character of Hillary Clinton. 

But it may not be enough. There was one finding that was astonishing to me, even though it probably shouldn’t be: 

“Given other considerations, 63 percent say it makes no difference.” 

Those are the very people that warning labels were created to protect . 

Meanwhile, on social media, the FBI emails are somehow not a trending topic. It certainly appears that Twitter, Facebook, Snapchat, and Buzzfeed are blacking out the topic. 

My biggest question is this: Why now? 

Why did James Comey, who has probably committed career suicide, along with a potential actual “suicide” via a shot to the back of his own head like others who have run afoul of the Clintons, feel the need to break the news, particularly after giving her a pass during the last investigation? 

Opponents will jump on the fact that he’s a Republican and will say that he did it for political reasons. 

They won’t admit that perhaps he felt guilty for being complicit in letting her off the hook in the first investigation into the Clinton email negligence. 

They will never, ever admit that maybe his integrity and belief in the office he holds made it impossible for him to keep quiet until after the election and that, perhaps, when he was given a chance to right a previous wrong, he took it. 

Clinton isn’t taking it gracefully. 

Clinton’s complaints, which have appeared in the press around the world, make her look even worse than she did before. 

This is from The Telegraph , a UK publication: 

Hillary Clinton was furiously fighting to keep her Presidential bid on track on Saturday night as her lead in the polls narrowed, after the FBI’s bombshell announcement that it had reopened its investigation into her emails. 

James Comey announced on Friday afternoon that fresh evidence had emerged for his investigation into whether Mrs Clinton was criminally negligent in her handling of classified material. 

On Saturday, the latest poll of polls by tracker site RealClearPolitics put Clinton 3.9 percentage points ahead of the Republican nationwide, down from 7.1 points just 10 days previously. 

But wait – it gets better: 

The Clinton campaign has responded with what amounts to a declaration of open warfare against Mr Comey, alleging that his actions are backed by a political motive. And Mrs Clinton herself called the decision “unprecedented” and “deeply troubling”. 

“It’s pretty strange to put something like that out with such little information right before an election,” she complained, addressing cheering supporters at a rally in the must-win state of Florida. 

Democrats questioned the timing of the agency’s decision, which comes as polls showed Mrs Clinton’s lead falling just 10 days before the presidential election. 

“This is like an 18-wheeler smacking into us, and it just becomes a huge distraction at the worst possible time,” said Donna Brazile, the chairwoman of the Democratic National Committee. 

“The campaign is trying to cut through the noise as best it can. 

“We don’t want it to knock us off our game. But on the second-to-last weekend of the race, we find ourselves having to tell voters, ‘Keep your focus, keep your eyes on the prize.’” 

Hillary’s campaign manager sounds pretty desperate to me. As for the complaints from HRC, they just make her sound like the out-of-touch, money-grabbing, power-hungry, deceitful",1
The devil you know will drag us through hell,"Posted 10/31/2016 12:28 pm by PatriotRising with 0 comments 
Halloween seems as good a time as any to remind ourselves that the United States is in the midst of perhaps the most truly horrifying presidential election in modern history. Sure, we’ve seen buffoons, members of political crime families and unhinged warmongers run for president before — but seldom in American politics has a political candidate been as unpredictable as Donald Trump or checked as many unsavory boxes as Hillary Clinton. 

In case you’re hoping to read an endorsement of Republican Donald Trump within the body of this piece, allow me to chill your anticipation: There won’t be one. 

While Trump has certainly led a successful life and smartly built a business empire by gaming a system which is stacked against the vast majority of Americans, there’s little reason to believe that he’s any more trustworthy than your average backcountry used car salesman. 

Trump’s worldview is shaded by a personal belief that everything he says and thinks absolutely is correct, believe me. That’s what makes him such a maverick salesman. In any sales 101 course, students learn that customers respond best to sales tactics dripping in assertions of authority on the subject of the product being sold. They don’t necessarily have to be true—but any fast talker worth his commission knows all the best words to make anything appear honest, if only long enough to get that signature on the dotted line. 

Trump is a gamble. 

And with that, maybe there is room for a slighted endorsement of a Trump presidency. At least he’s peddling a product to the American voting public. He’s going to “Make America Great Again,” whatever that means. 

We haven’t actually gotten a good look at the nuts and bolts of the Trump sales equation, so it is at best an as-is sale. 

Hillary Clinton, meanwhile, can be precisely defined as “the devil we know.” 

Not only has she spent three decades in various states of public office, but by mishandling sensitive information she’s also carelessly made available the finer points of her plans for the American future. 

Unfortunately, the terrifying reality of Clinton’s vision are of little consequence to her campaign. The Clinton family developed a winning formula for media manipulation way back when they occupied the Arkansas Governor’s Mansion, so she has no need to finesse supporters into believing in her product. 

If you know anyone supporting Clinton simply because they are put off by Trump’s lack of a political record, here are a few things you ought to let them know. 

Clinton’s email scandal is only just beginning. As president, the controversy would likely continue to distract her from the work of running America. 

She is a deranged sociopathic war criminal who should be indicted for conspiracy and murder. 

A Clinton White House would heighten tensions between the U.S. and Russia by doubling down on Clinton’s failed State Department policies. 

Clinton refuses to take responsibility for any of her actions . 

Given Clinton’s trouble from transparency groups, her election would likely bring about a major crackdown on whistleblowers. 

Clinton is also, as one journalist put it, beholden to scumbags who she will work for from the Oval Office. 

The bottom line here is that Americans hoping for a transformative outcome in the 2016 presidential election are likely to be very disappointed. Aside from saying “not Clinton,” it’s pretty impossible to say anyone really deserves a thinking American’s vote in this cycle. The third-parties, as usual, are hell’s snowballs thanks to the political establishment’s efforts; and neither mainstream candidate is likely to reverse the nation’s leading causes of decline: cronyism, military adventurism, ballooning government and a continued disregard for the constitutional principles on which it was founded.",1
The Fix Is In: NBC Affiliate Accidentally Posts Election Results A Week Early: Hillary Wins Presidency 42% to Trump’s 40%,"Posted 11/03/2016 12:44 am by PatriotRising with 1 comment 
Why The U.S. Presidential Election Has The Entire World Confused By Brandon Smith 

Well, everyone thought it was a sure thing — Hillary Clinton had the White House in the bag; the entire political system from the DNC to the RNC and the mainstream media had already called the election over and done. Online gambling sites listed Clinton as a sure bet and Irish site Paddy Power even paid out one million dollars on the assumption of a Clinton win. And then, one Weiner ruined everything — Anthony Weiner. 

The revelation of an October surprise re-opening of the FBI’s investigation into Hillary Clinton’s misuse of classified data on private and vulnerable email servers does not come as a shock to me, but it certainly does to many people around the world. Hundreds of mainstream outlets are scrambling to spin the news as misconduct by the FBI rather than a victory for the halls of justice. Numerous alternative media analysts are rushing to cover their butts and admit that there is now a “chance” of a Trump win. Confusion reigns supreme as the weirdest election in U.S. history continues to bewilder observers. 

The first issue that needs to be addressed is the lack of an open mind displayed by some when it comes to the real purpose behind this election. The second issue here, of course, is one of timing. 

Through the majority of this election cycle the public consensus has been that Clinton will win. Some argued that Trump would not be able to compete with the leftist media empire standing against him, while others have argued that the entire system including the Republican establishment would ensure that Trump would fail. The alternative media has in the past simply pointed out that elections have always been rigged, either by the elites playing both sides of the competition, or through outright voter fraud. They have assumed that the elites want Clinton, and therefore, the election has already been decided. 

I tend to agree with the latter point of view, though I disagree with the conclusion. U.S. elections are indeed controlled, and have been for decades, primarily through the false left/right paradigm. However, as I have been pointing out since I correctly predicted the success of the Brexit referendum, I don’t think that Clinton is the choice of the elites. 

I outline my reasons for this conclusion in-depth in articles like ‘2016 Will End With Economic Instability And A Trump Presidency’ , published in August. For the past several months it seems as though I have been the only person holding the view that Trump will be president. Only in the past few days have I received emails from readers stating that they used to think I was probably crazy, but now they aren’t so sure… 

To be clear, my position is that Trump is slated to take the White House and that this is by design. This has been my position since before Trump won the Republican Primaries, it was my position when the election cycle began, it has never changed, nor have my views on the reasons for this outcome ever changed. Of course, the election is not over yet, and if Clinton ends up soiling the already thoroughly soiled Oval Office with her presence, then everyone can color me confused as well. That said, here are some issues that I think many people are overlooking when coming to conclusions on the election and the events surrounding it. 

Clinton Is The Worst Candidate The Elites Could Have Chosen 

I have been studying the activities and behaviors of establishment elites for over a decade and I have to say… they are not stupid. They certainly have hubris, and I would not call them “wise,” but they are definitely devious. They know how to rig a game. They know how to play both sides. They know how to cheat to get what they want when it comes to politics and how to manufacture consent from portions of the public. They’ve been doing it a long time. They have mastered it. 

So, in my view it is rather insane for the elites to field a candidate such as Hillary Clinton IF the entirety of their globalist empire hangs in the balance (I don’t think it does). Though she is fond of BleachBit, the woman is unbleachable. With a decades-long rap sheet from her work at Rose Law Firm (in which document destruction and “misplacement” was apparently routine) to her interference with investigations into Bill Clinton’s sexual indiscretions, to the strange odyssey surrounding her lies on the Benghazi attack, as well as her rampant mishandling of classified documents as head of the State Department, not to mention the Clinton Foundation’s pay to play scandals, it is impossible to endear her to the masses. Her dismal crowd turnouts are rather indicative of this. 

On top of all this, Clinton’s anti-Russia rhetoric is coming off as absolutely crazy, and I think this is by design. Many in the alternative media, while assuming that Clinton is paving the way for WWIII, forget that the average person may not be up to speed on the same information we are, but most of them aren’t ignorant. Clinton’s ravings on Russian hacking and potential war are even putting liberals off rather than inspiring their confidence. 

One would think that if the elites have their veritable pick of any politician to represent their interests in the White House and convince the American public to go along for the ride, Clinton would be the worst choice. Even if the intention were to rig the election in favor of Clinton, she would be a lame-duck president the second she took office, and, her mere presence would galvanize conservatives to the point of mass rebellion. 

This is not generally how the elites play the game. Instead, they prefer co-option to direct confrontation. 

Which President Is Better For The Elites During An Economic Breakdown? 

If you consider the premise that Clinton is NOT the chosen one, and that the entire election is theater, the situation changes rather drastically. 

Those that follow the underlying economic data that the mainstream tends to ignore know that large swaths of the global financial system are not long for this world. With Europe’s banking system plunging towards a Lehman-style event, the OPEC production freeze deal ready to fall apart yet again, and the Federal Reserve threatening to raise rates into recessionary conditions in December, our already floundering fiscal structure is approaching another crisis. 

My questions has always been who would the elites rather have in office when this crisis occurs? I’ve said it a hundred times before and I’ll say it again here: with Clinton in office, globalists and international financiers get the blame for any economic downturn. With Trump in office, conservative movements will be blamed. In fact, I suggest anyone who doubts this scenario watch stock market reactions every time Trump rises in the polls or Clinton faces renewed scandal. The narrative is already being prepared — a Trump win equals a market loss. 

For those that think it outlandish that the public could be tricked into blaming Trump and conservatives for an economic crisis, I suggest they consider that possession is nine-tenths of the law in the minds of many. People can also be irrational when facing financial ruin. I would remind readers that history is written by the victors. The globalists plan to be victorious in the dismantling of America and our founding principles. Whether or not they succeed is really up to average conservatives and liberty proponents, not Trump. 

The FBI’s Move Prepares The Way For Trump 

Clinton and the DNC argue that FBI Director James Comey’s announcement of a re-opened investigation is politically motivated. And they are right, sort of. The real motivation, I believe, is that Clinton was never meant to win the election in the first place, and that the elites want Trump placed in power during the final hours of the U.S. economy. Everything else is just a Kabuki dance. 

The democrats are crying foul and accusing Comey of “working with Putin,” or working with the alt-right. The nefarious Harry Reid has even accused the FBI of hiding Trump’s supposed ties to the Russian government and violating the Hatch Act. 

I think much of this outrage is real, as I believe much of the mainstream media attacks on Trump are coming from people who really think they are waging a propaganda war to get Hillary Clinton elected. This, however, does not mean that the elites plan to install Clinton. 

Some might see my position as bizarre. I understand. But equally bizarre to me are some of the rationalizations people attempt to argue when dealing with the Comey revelation. 

For example, the argument that the entire re-opening of the investigation is a complex ploy designed by the establishment to distract away from the Wikileaks data dumps. This makes little sense. If anything, the re-opening investigation is only bringing MORE attention to the Wikileaks data, not less. If the elites were hoping to create a distraction, they failed miserably. 

The FBI’s announcement ONLY harms the Clinton campaign. Period. Even if it fizzles out, even if they announce that nothing was found, the investigation hitting the news streams so close to election day refocuses all public attention back on Clinton’s corruption and will continue to do so for the next week at least. The idea that the elites hope to use it to help Clinton is nonsensical. 

I have also seen the argument that Comey is acting to cover his own posterior, perhaps because of a fear that Trump may steal away a victory. I find this equally absurd. Months back the consensus among alternative analysts was that Comey (placed in the FBI by Obama) was a traitor and the FBI was a puppet agency of the establishment. Now, suddenly, Comey is worried about a possible Trump win and so takes an action which might self-fulfill the prophecy? 

Comey does what he is told. The FBI is an owned and operated elitist franchise. They do not go rogue. If the rogue FBI narrative were true and Comey actually feels the need to cover his bases with Trump, then it is only because he knows something the rest of us do not. With Clinton in office, his goose would be cooked after this little incident. Comey only gains an advantage if Trump is slated to win. 

Trump May Or May Not Be Aware Of The Plan 

The bottom line, according to the evidence I have seen in terms of elitists influence over U.S. elections, is that if Trump wins it will only be because they wanted him to win. The FBI firestorm this past week appears to support my view and we still have another week left for further Clinton ugliness to be revealed. I also expect that if Trump wins, the reaction from conservatives and liberty activists will be that the event was a “miracle,” a shocking upset against the establishment. Much like the reaction to the Brexit referendum. I continue to hold that conservatives and sovereignty champions in Europe and America are being set up to take the fall for a coming global destabilization. 

I have not taken this position just to be contrary. If I think about it honestly, my position is truly a losing position. If I am mistaken and Clinton wins on the 8th then I’ll probably never hear the end of it, but that’s a risk that has to be taken, because what I see here is a move on the chess board that others are not considering. If I’m wrong, then I’m wrong. 

That said, if I am right, then I still lose, because Trump supporters and half the liberty movement will be so enraptured that they will probably ignore the greater issue — that Trump is the candidate the elites wanted all along. 

If I am right, I cannot say either way if Trump is aware that he will be a potential scapegoat for the elites. With Trump on the way to the White House I can guarantee a Fed rate hike in December. Imagine what a staged war between Trump and the Federal Reserve will do to the U.S. dollar? What a way to destroy the currency’s world reserve status and make way for the IMF’s Special Drawing Rights! I also suspect that widespread rioting is on the schedule as well from various social justice mobs; a perfect excuse for expansive martial law measures, don’t you think? 

The point is, as horrifying as a Clinton presidency might be to conservatives (or to everyone), don’t get too comfortable under Trump. The party is just getting started and our vigilance must be even greater with a conservative White House, because, like it or not, everything Trump does is going to reflect on us.

Crony Media Have Permanently Disgraced Themselves - Patriot Rising,"Posted 11/15/2016 9:23 am by PatriotRising with 0 comments 
Americans have been to the polls. Everything is over but the shouting — by the loser, that is honest Hil. I predicted that the best Trump could have hoped for was winning the popular vote but losing the Electoral College but I got it wrong: the Donald has triumphed. An underfunded campaign — he spent barely half of what she did — with a skeletal crew and without the party’s full backing won out because not all of America agrees with the values of Jay-Z, Beyoncé, Springsteen, Hollywood in general and gay marriage in particular. 

Trump appealed to those who have been snubbed, the great ignored. They are mainly blue-collar whites who had long been belittled and overlooked by the media until suddenly their knight in a shiny gold Cadillac appeared. In a rare moment of openness, Hillary described these people as ‘deplorable’. Basically, Trump’s message was that to embrace extremism was to acknowledge the danger in absolute terms: no more Muslims coming in, no more Nafta, a wall to stop Mexicans, and so on. Even more profoundly, even nice, unsophisticated Americans wondered why Hillary or Obama had been so squeamish about calling a spade a spade, i.e., radical Islamic terrorism. As a Trump follower wrote, ‘Moderation in the pursuit of evil is no virtue. 

Imperfect as Trump was a candidate, his enemies are the very same people who are shocked (in the manner of Captain Renault) by the ignorance of hoi polloi, and who decided long ago that these people are not to be trusted. You know the kind: Beltway insiders, media pundits, academics, policy professionals, Hollywood types, fashion elites, TV celebrities, professional race hustlers, gay activists; you name what’s in the news nowadays, they were against the Donald. They are part of the arrangement. Their European counterparts are in the EU, and among the Remainers. 

If one had to slice it down even further, this election was basically the politically correct versus the politically incorrect. Although blue collars may not sound too sophisticated to snotty-nosed Beltway insiders, the blues know that this is no longer a war between nation states but a fight between civilizations: Islam and the West. An American president with an IQ lower than his younger daughter’s age invaded the Middle East, claiming that the region would welcome having American values imposed upon it. Hillary voted for that disastrous action; Trump was against it from the start. Americans see Europe and cringe. They see ‘Frenchmen’ cheering as their white countrymen are murdered in cold blood by Muslims and realize that this is a war fought by immigration. They put two and two together and calculate that in 100 years there will be more Muslims in Europe than white European Christians and that Sharia law will be imposed from above. And they also see a Dutch MP on trial for speaking against unlimited immigration, an MP, incidentally, who was refused entry to the UK for being right-wing, whatever that means. 

One political philosopher at Oxford asked, ‘What gives a country the right to control its borders?’ Well, I’m asking who gave his mother the right to give birth to such a moron, but then not everyone is as rude as yours truly. And then, of course, the R-word comes into it. That’s what the election was and will be all about in the near future. Race is to America what immigration is to Europe: the large pachyderm crowding everyone out of the chic drawing-room in Chelsea. 
Whites choose to live, as do blacks, among their own — if they have the choice. Churches self-segregate and whites flee to the suburbs once blacks move in next door. The elites, however, call this racism, although they would not dream of living next to a black family unless they were the Obamas, and then some. And as more and more Africans move to the States, there are more and more natives who feel a kind of cultural dispossession and a belief that Uncle Sam cannot thrive as an increasingly multiracial nation. Those who feel this way have been X-rated by the elites, and are called racists, homophobes, sexists, xenophobes and morally deformed. These people found a champion in Trump. 

And now a word about the fourth estate: I knew the fix was in long ago — never have the media been as incapable of separating fact from fiction and truth be damned — but when Vogue came out slamming Trump, I almost pissed in my St Laurent silk underwear. Never before have so many news outlets abandoned all pretence of fairness in reporting an election. Never before have newspapers — with the exception of the New York Times , which always mixes reporting news with editorialising — allowed reporters to express their opinions in so-called news stories. And the TV reportage was just as bad. You know the kind of thing: the pursed lips and air of healthy scepticism when it came to anything resembling a pro-Trump comment; the head tilt of doubt in response to any Trump announcement; the look of outraged authority when anyone defended Trump. The ones I found amusing were the lightweights of Vogue , those narcissistic onanists who somehow viewed Trump as an American version of Brexit. His hair and make-up was an affront to their preening self-importance. They minced their way to Hillary. 

But the Donald has won and, best of all, the New York Times , the Washington Post , the New Yorker and the three main networks have once and for all disgraced themselves by proving they have no idea what this country is about. Yippee!

UMass students hold ‘sh*t-in’ for gender-neutral bathrooms,"Posted 11/16/2016 2:11 pm by PatriotRising with 0 comments Students at the University of Massachusetts, Amherst are staging a week-long “shit-in,” occupying restrooms in an administration building to demand more gender-neutral facilities. Gender Liberation UMass, the student group behind the demonstration, announced Tuesday that administrators had “tentatively agreed to progressive ‘benchmarks’ put forth by organizers,” but urges supporters to remain on-call. 
Students at the University of Massachusetts, Amherst are staging a week-long “shit-in,” occupying restrooms in an administration building to demand more gender-neutral facilities. 

The “ Shit-In at Whitmore ” demonstration began Monday morning at the Whitmore Administration building (which the activists have nicknamed “Queermore”), and organizers intend to have students continue occupying stalls in the building’s male and female restrooms until their demands are met, though the Facebook event specifies a Friday afternoon ending. 

“Maybe [administrators] will feel a little bit as anxious as trans students do just trying to pee on campus.” Tweet This 

Gender Liberation UMass (GLU), a student group at UMass, is responsible for organizing the event, and provides an online sign-up form for supporters to stake out specific times and locations, giving them the option of stating whether they prefer to be along in a stall or to share one with “other sitters.” 

The primary goal of the protest is to convince the administration to convert additional bathrooms on campus into gender-neutral facilities by changing the signage, which the group believes will promote “trans inclusivity and safety on campus,” but GLU has also articulated two additional demands, pledging to continue obstructing toilets until all three are met. 

In addition to gender-neutral restrooms, the group is calling for the “advancement of medically and socially competent in-house transgender health services at the University Health Services center,” as well as the “hiring of a professor by the WGSS [Women, Gender, and Sexuality Studies Department] who is an expert in the field of critical transmisogyny from an intersectional perspective.” 
Divest UMass, a student environmentalist group, released a statement on its Facebook page expressing solidarity with the GLU protesters 

“These demands are elementary, and it is disappointing that UMass has failed to meet the needs of trans and gender non-conforming students to date. The administration must seriously put a plan into action to de-gender its facilities,” the message declares. “In the meantime, maybe they will feel a little bit as anxious as trans students do just trying to pee on the campus they pay tuition to every single day.” 

Although the objectives of Divest UMass are not directly related to those being pursued by GLU, but leaders of the Divest group explained their interest in the “shit-in” by asserting that all progressive causes are interrelated, saying, “There can be no climate justice without gender justice. There can no be gender justice without racial justice. There can no be racial justice without economic justice. There can be no economic justice without social justice.” 

Within a day of the restroom occupation starting, GLU announced that it had secured a meeting with Vice Chancellor of Student Affairs Enku Gelaye on Tuesday morning to discuss its demands, and subsequently reported Tuesday evening that administrators had “tentatively agreed to progressive ‘benchmarks’ put forth by organizers.” 

“The administration is definitely listening and the tones of our conversation have changed quite a bit,” one GLU member told Campus Reform , though the group is cautioning its supporters to remain prepared, because “the need for action may arise at any moment.” 

“Changing the signage really is not very expensive, and I don’t want to talk bad about the administration here, but that’s one of the things we’ve had to go back and forth about, is this idea of the cost of it,” another GLU member added. “I and other members of GLU think the numbers they have proposed for what it would cost to change the signage are way beyond what it would really be.” 

UMass Executive Director of Strategic Communications Ed Blaguszewski, however, told Campus Reform that the university is committed to expanding the availability of gender-neutral restrooms, making no mention of cost concerns while asserting that university officials would continue to meet regularly with transgender students to discuss their concerns. 

“Currently, there are more than 200 gender-inclusive, single-user restrooms on campus, and during the coming year more than 50 will be added, either by construction or by converting single-user ‘Men’ or ‘Women’ facilities to ‘Restrooms,’” he explained, adding that “All new construction and major renovations on campus will include gender-inclusive restrooms.",1

Here Are The Presstitutes Who Control American’s Minds: http://www.veteransnewsnow.com/2016/10/26/1010359-65-us-journalists-at-a-private-dinner-with-hillary-clintons-team-and-john-podesta/ 
I just heard an NPR presstitute delare that Texas, a traditional sure thing
for Republicans was up for grabs in the presidential election. Little wonder if this report on Zero Hedge is correct. Apparently, the voting machines are already at work stealing the election for Killary.
http://www.zerohedge.com/news/2016-10-25/texas-rigged-first-reports-voting-machines-switching-votes-hillary-texas 
From my long experience in journalism, I know the American public is not very sharp. Nevertheless, it is difficult for me to believe that Americans, whose jobs, careers, and the same for their children and grandchildren, have been sold out by the elites who Hillary represents would actually vote for her. It makes no sense. If this were the case, how did Trump get the Republican nomination despite the vicious presstitute campaign against him? 
It seems obvious that the majority of Americans who have been suffering terribly at the hands of the One Percent who own Hillary lock, stock, and barrel, will not vote for the people who have ruined their lives and the lives of their children and grandchildren. 
Furthermore, if Trump’s election is as impossible as the presstitutes tell us—Hillary’s win is 93% certain according to the latest presstitute pronouncement—the vicious 24/7 attacks on Trump would be pointless. Wouldn’t they? Why the constant, frenetic, vicious attacks on a person who has no chance? 
There are reports that a company associated with Hillary backer George Soros is supplying the voting machines to 16 states, including states that determine election outcomes. I do not know that these reports are correct. However, I do know for a fact that the oligarchic interests that rule America are opposed to Trump being elected President for the simple reason that they are unsure that they would be able to control him. 
It is hard to believe that dispossessed Americans will vote for Hillary, the representative of those who have dispossessed them, when Trump says he will re-empower the dispossessed. Hillary has denigrated ordinary Americans who, she says, she is so removed from by her wealth that she doesn’t even know who they are. Clearly, Hillary, paid $675,000 by Goldman Sachs for three 20-minute speeches, is not a representative of the people. She represents the One Percent whose policies have flushed the prospects of ordinary Americans down the toilet.
What is really disturbing is the pretense by the presstitute scum that Trump’s lewd admiration for female charms is deemed more important than the prospect of nuclear war. At no time during the presidential primaries or during the current presidential campaign has it been mentioned that Russia is being assaulted daily by propaganda, threatened by military buildups, and being convinced that the United States and its European vassals are planning an attack. 
A threatened Russia, made insecure by inexplicable hostility and Western propaganda, is a danger manufactured by the neoconservative supporters of Hillary Clinton. 
If the American people are really so unbelievably stupid that they think lewd remarks about women are more important than avoiding nuclear war, the American people are too stupid to exist. They will deserve the mushroom clouds that will wipe them and everyone else off the face of the earth.
Donald Trump is the only candidate in the primaries and the general election who has said that he sees no point in conflict with Russia when Putin has shown nothing but desire to work things out to mutual advantage.
In contrast, Hillary has declared the thrice-elected president of Russia to be “the new Hitler” and has threatened Russia with military action. Hillary talks openly about regime change in Russia.
Surely, in a free media at least one person in the print and TV media would raise this most important of all points. But where have you seen it?
Only in my columns and a few others in the alternative media.
In other words, we are about to have an election in which the important issue has played no role. And yet allegedly we are the exceptional, indispensable people, a people’s democracy protected by a free press.
In truth, this mythical description of America is merely a cloak for the rule of the Oligarchs. And the Oligarchs are risking life on earth for their continual supremacy.

Michelle Obama Promotes Lewd Rappers,"Michelle Obama Promotes Lewd Rappers
From Gerald Celente’s Trend Alert
Michelle Obama’s ‘rap’ more disgusting than Trump talk
KINGSTON, NY, 26 October 2016—Hitting the campaign trail for Hillary Clinton in New Hampshire, Michelle Obama made headline news lashing out at Donald Trump’s boast on a 2005 tape that as a star he could “do anything to women.” Calling Trump’s statements so “shocking and demeaning” that “I can’t stop thinking about this; it has shaken to me to my core,” Ms. Obama said she was campaigning against “hateful language about women.” 
Ms. Obama also chastised Mr. Trump for “speaking freely and openly about sexually predatory behavior,” and “using language so obscene that many of us were worried about our children hearing it when we turn on the TV.” 
Bad Rap
While Trump’s statements were offensive to women, they pale in comparison to the loud chorus of rappers’ filth and denigration of women that Michelle and Barack Obama have continually promoted, championed, wined and dined at the White House. And, while she has condemned Trump’s lewd remarks – including how “loving fathers are sickened by the thought of their daughters being exposed to this kind of vicious language” – the Obamas have hosted in the “The People’s House,” where their two daughters reside, rappers who obscenely rap about date rape and sexual predatory behavior.
Indeed, it is not the presidential race that “little girls” are tuned into to hear “about who they should look like, how they should act,” or hearing “language so obscene that many of us worry about our children hearing it when we turn on the TV,” as Obama claimed in her speech. Young people are not watching TV with mommy and daddy. They tune into the music/entertainment world that promotes “hateful language about women” performed by White House guest rappers such as:
Rick Ross, “U.O.E.N.O.”
Put Molly all in her champagne, she ain’t even know it
I took her home and I enjoyed that, she ain’t even know it…
(Molly is a street name for ecstasy, a ‘love drug’) 
Big Sean, “Mona Lisa” 
I believe in God and rubbers
Even if we sex you are not my lover
Hit you on the couch and not the covers 
And if you bring you friend then we got to f#ck her…
When they go low, we go high
Beyond the rappers, Michelle Obama also has elevated Beyonce´ – a performer who dresses and dances in sync with her sexually explicit lyric library – as a “role model for young girls around the world,” and is “proud to have my daughter grow up in a world where she has people like you, to look up to.”
Thus, while the first lady continually brags about raising the moral bar of integrity while condemning Trump’s words and deeds, the media have ignored the far greater of two evils: The blatant hypocrisy of Michelle Obama, who supports a deplorable, debased entertainment industry drenched in debauchery that is poisoning the planet.
Publisher’s Note: We are political atheists and support neither presidential candidate.

While the idiot presstitutes and their brainwashed victims hyper-ventilate about Trump’s lewd talk about women, one consequence of the ignored nuclear arms race restarted by the neoconservatives, who have been in charge of US foreign policy in the 21st century, is the Russian Satan 2, which is reported to be capable of destroying the entirety of a land mass the size of Texas or France with one hit. 
The neoconservative foreign policy that has produced this result is obviously a total failure and endangers all life on earth. Hillary Clinton is a representative of this disastrous foreign policy. If Americans and Europeans cannot put into office people who can get along with Russia, there is no future for anyone. Trump is the only one who says he sees no point in conflict with Russia. This is what is important, not lewd talk about women.

How The Oligarchs Plan To Steal The Election
Paul Craig Roberts
I am now convinced that the Oligarchy that rules America intends to steal the presidential election. In the past, the oligarchs have not cared which candidate won as the oligarchs owned both. But they do not own Trump.
Most likely you are unaware of what Trump is telling people as the media does not report it. A person who speaks like this: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYozWHBIf8g&app=desktop is not endeared to the oligarchs.
Who are the oligarchs? 
—Wall Street and the mega-banks too big to fail and their agent the Federal Reserve, a federal agency that put 5 banks ahead of millions of troubled American homeowners who the federal reserve allowed to be flushed down the toilet. In order to save the mega-banks’ balance sheets from their irresponsible behavior, the Fed has denied retirees any interest income on their savings for eight years, forcing the elderly to draw down their savings, leaving their heirs, who have been displaced from employment by corporate jobs offshoring, penniless.
—The military/security complex which has spent trillions of our taxpayer dollars on 15 years of gratuitous wars based entirely on lies in order to enrich themselves and their power.
—The neoconservartives whose crazed ideology of US world hegemony thrusts the American people into military conflict with Russia and China.
—The US global corporations that sent American jobs to China and India and elsewhere in order to enrich the One Percent with higher profits from lower labor costs.
—Agribusiness (Monsanto et.al.), corporations that poison the soil, the water, the oceans, and our food with their GMOs, hebicides, pesticides, and chemical fertilizers, while killing the bees that pollinate the crops.
—The extractive industries—energy, mining, fracking, and timber—that maximize their profits by destroying the environment and the water supply.
—The Israel Lobby that controls US Middle East policy and is committing genocide against the Palestinians just as the US committed genocide against native Americans. Israel is using the US to eliminate sovereign countries that stand in Israell’s way.
What convinces me that the Oligarchy intends to steal the election is the vast difference between the presstitutes’ reporting and the facts on the ground. 
According to the presstitutes, Hillary is so far ahead that there is no point in Trump supporters bothering to vote. Hillary has won the election before the vote. Hillary has been declared a 93% sure winner.
I am yet to see one Hillary yard sign, but Trump signs are everywhere. Reports I receive are that Hillary’s public appearances are unattended but Trumps are so heavily attended that people have to be turned away. This is a report from a woman in Florida: 
“Trump has pulled huge numbers all over FL while campaigning here this week. I only see Trump signs and sickers in my wide travels. I dined at a Mexican restaurant last night. Two women my age sitting behind me were talking about how they had tried to see Trump when he came to Tallahassee. They left work early, arriving at the venue at 4:00 for a 6:00 rally. The place was already over capacity so they were turned away. It turned out that there were so many people there by 2:00 that the doors had to be opened to them. The women said that the crowds present were a mix of races and ages.”
I know the person who gave me this report and have no doubt whatsoever as to its veracity. 
I also receive from readers similiar reports from around the country. 
This is how the theft of the election is supposed to work: The media concentrated in a few corporate hands has gone all out to convince not only Americans but also the world, that Donald Trump is such an unacceptable candidate that he has lost the election before the vote. 
By controllng the explanation, when the election is stolen those who challenge the stolen election are without a foundartion in the media. All media reports will say that it was a run away victory for Hillary over the misogynist immigrant-hating Trump.
And liberal, progressive opinion will be relieved and off guard as Hillary takes us into nuclear war.
That the Oligarchy intends to steal the election from the American people is verified by the officially reported behavior of the voting machines in early voting in Texas. The NRP presstitutes have declared that Hillary is such a favorite that even Repulbican Texas is up for grabs in the election. 
If this is the case, why was it necessary for the voting machines to be programmed to change Trump votes to Hillary votes? Those voters who noted that they voted Trump but were recorded Hillary complained. The election officials, claiming a glitch (which only went one way), changed to paper ballots. But who will count them? No “glitches” caused Hillary votes to go to Trump, only Trump votes to go to Hillary.
The most brilliant movie of our time was The Matrix. This movie captured the life of Americans manipulated by a false reality, only in the real America there is insufficient awareness and no Neo, except possibly Donald Trump, to challenge the system. All of my life I have been trying to get Americans of all stripes—academics, scholars, journalists, Republicans, Democrats, right-wing, left-wing, US Representatives, US Senators, Presidents, corporate moguls and brainwashed Americans and foreigners—out of the false reality in which they exist. 
In the United States today a critical presidential election is in process in which not a single important issue is addressed by Hillary and the presstitutes. This is total failure. Democracy, once the hope of the world, has totally failed in the United States of America. Trump is correct. The American people must restore the accountability of government to the people.

“Ammon Bundy’s attorney Marcus Mumford sought the release of Ammon Bundy based upon the verdict of not guilty. The Federal Marshals refused to release him. Mumford insisted that they show the paperwork that allowed them to keep Ammon in custody. They wouldn’t show the paperwork.

Can Trump Save America Like Putin Saved Russia? 
The Saker 
October 22, 2016 
A crisis faces America: 
Option one: Hillary wins. That’s Obama on steroids, only worse. Remember that Obama himself was Dubya, only worse. Of course, Dubya was just Clinton, only worse. Now the circle is closed. Back to Clinton. Except this time around, we have a woman who is deeply insecure, who failed at every single thing that she every tried to do, and who now has a 3 decades long record of disasters and failures. Even when she had no authority to start a war, she started one (told Bill to bomb the Serbs). Now she might have that authority. And she had to stand there, in front of millions of people, and hear Trump tell her “Putin outsmarted you at every step of the way.” Did you see her frozen face when he said that? Trump is right, Putin did outsmart her and Obama at every step. The problem is that now, after having a President with an inferiority complex towards Putin (Obama) we will have a President with the very same inferiority complex and a morbid determination to impose a no-fly zone over Russian forces in Syria. Looking at Hillary, with her ugly short hair and ridiculous pants, I thought to myself “this is a woman who is trying hard to prove that she is every bit as tough and any man” – except of course that she ain’t. Her record also shows her as being weak, cowardly and with a sense of total impunity. And now, that evil messianic lunatic (http://thesaker.is/the-messianic-lunatic-in-her-own-words/) with a deep-seated inferiority complex might become Commander in Chief?! God help us all! 
Option two: Trump wins. Problem: he will be completely alone. The Neocons have a total, repeat total, control of the Congress, the media, banking and finance, and the courts. From Clinton to Clinton they have deeply infiltrated the Pentagon, Foggy Bottom, and the three letter agencies. The Fed is their stronghold. How in the world will Trump deal with these rabid “ crazies in the basement”? http://www.opednews.com/articles/opedne_donald_a_080423_leo_strauss_and_the_.htm 
Consider the vicious hate campaign which all these “personalities” (from actors, to politicians to reporters) have unleashed against Trump – they have burned their bridges, they know that they will lose it all if Trump wins (and, if he proves to be an easy pushover his election will make no difference anyway). The Neocons have nothing to lose and they will fight to the very last one. What could Trump possibly do to get anything done if he is surrounded by Neocons and their agents of influence? Bring in an entirely different team? How is he going to vet them? His first choice was to take Pence as a VP – a disaster (he is already sabotaging Trump on Syria and the elections outcome). I *dread* to hear whom Trump will appoint as a White House Chief of Staff as I am afraid that just to appease the Neocons he will appoint some new version of the infamous Rahm Emanuel… And should Trump prove that he has both principles and courage, the Neocons can always “Dallas” him and replace him with Pence. Et voilà! 
I see only one way out: 
How Putin Rescued Russia When Putin came to power he inherited a Kremlin every bit as corrupt and traitor-infested as the White House nowadays. As for Russia, she was in pretty much the same sorry shape as the Independent Nazi-run Ukraine. Russia was also run by bankers and AngloZionist puppets and most Russians led miserable lives. The big difference is that, unlike what is happening with Trump, the Russian version of the US Neocons never saw the danger coming from Putin. He was selected by the ruling elites as the representative of the security services to serve along a representative of the big corporate money, Medvedev. This was a compromise solution between the only two parts of the Russian society which were still functioning, the security services and oil/gas money. Putin looked like a petty bureaucrat in an ill fitting suit, a shy and somewhat awkward little guy who would present no threat to the powerful oligarchs of the the Seven Bankers running Russia ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semibankirschina ). Except that he turned out to be one of the most formidable rulers in Russia history. Here is what Putin did as soon as he came to power: 
First, he re-established the credibility of the Kremlin with the armed forces and security services by rapidly and effectively crushing the Wahabi insurgency in Chechnia. This established his personal credibility with the people he would have to rely on to deal with the oligarchs. 
Second, he used the fact that everybody, every single businessman and corporation in Russia, did more or less break the law during the 1990s, if only because there really was no law. Instead of cracking down on the likes of Berezovski or Khodorkovski for their political activities, he crushed them with (absolutely true) charges of corruption. Crucially, he did that very publicly, sending a clear message to the other arch-enemy: the media. 
Third, contrary to the hallucinations of the western human rights agencies and Russian liberals, Putin never directly suppressed any dissent, or cracked down on the media or, even less so, ordered the murder of anybody. He did something much smarter. Remember that modern journalists are first and foremost presstitutes, right? By mercilessly cracking down on the oligarchs Putin deprived the presstitutes of their source of income and political support. Some emigrated to the Ukraine, others simply resigned, and a few were left like on a reservation or a zoo on a few very clearly identifiable media outlets such as Dozhd TV, Ekho Moskvy Radio or the newspaper Kommersant. Those who emigrated became irrelevant, as for those who stayed in the “liberal zoo” – they were harmless as they had no credibility left. Crucially, everybody else “got the message”. After that, all it took is the appointment a few real patriots (such as Dmitri Kiselev, Margarita Simonian and others) in key positions and everybody quickly understood that the winds of fortune had now turned. 
Fourth, once the main media outlets were returned back to sanity it did not take too long for the “liberal” (in the Russian sense, meaning pro-USA) parties to enter into a death-spiral from which they have never recovered. That, in turn, resulted in the ejection of all “liberals” from the Duma which now has only 4 parties, all of them more or less “patriotic”. That’s the part of Putin’s strategy that worked. 
So far, Putin has failed to eject the 5th columnists, whom I call the “Atlantic Integrationists” (see http://thesaker.is/putins-biggest-failure/ ) from the government itself. What is certain is that Putin has not tackled the 5th columnists in the banking/finance sector and that the latter are being very careful not to give him a pretext to take action against them. 
Russia and the USA are very different countries, and no recipe can be simply copied from one to another. Still, there are valuable lessons from the “Putin model” for Trump, not the least of which that his most formidable enemies probably are sitting in the Fed and in the banks that control the Fed. What is sure is that for the time being the image of the USA will continue to be that of homeless veterans abandoned by the US government wrapping themselves in the American flag and asking for coins in a cup. 
Hillary thinks that Ameria’s wars are a stunning success. Trump thinks that they are a disgrace. I submit that the choice between these two is really very simple. 
To those who are saying that there cannot be a schism in the AngloZionist elites, I reply that the example of the conspiracy to prevent Dominique Strauss-Kahn from becoming the next French president ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_v._Strauss-Kahn ) shows that, just like hyenas, AngloZionist leaders do sometimes turn on each other. That happens in all regimes, regardless of their political ideology (think SS against SA in Nazi Germany or Trotskists against Stalinists in Boshevik USSR). 
An Iron Broom Leon Trotsky used to say the Soviet Russia needed to be cleansed from anarchists and noblemen with an “iron broom”. He even wrote an article in the Pravda entitled “We need an iron broom”. Another genocidal manic, Felix Derzhinskii, founder of the notorious ChK secret police, used to say that a secret police officer must have a “burning heart, a cool head and clean hands”. One would seek weakness, or even compassion, in vain from folks like these. These are ideology-driven “true believers”, sociopaths with no sense of empathy, profoundly evil people with a genocidal hatred of anybody standing in their way. 
Hillary Clinton and her gang of Neocons are the spiritual (and sometimes even physical) successors of the Soviet Bolsheviks and they, just like their Bolshevik forefathers, will not hesitate for a second to crush their enemies. Donald Trump – assuming he is for real and actually means what he says – has to understand that and do what Putin did: strike first and strike hard. 
Stalin, by the way, also did exactly that, and the Trotskyists were crushed. 
I think that the jury is still out on whether Putin will succeed in finally removing the 5th columnists from power. What is sure is that Russia is at least semi-free from the control of the Anglo-Zionists and that the US is their last bastion right now. Their maniacal hatred of Trump can in part be explained by the sense of danger these folks feel, being threatened for the first time in what they see as their homeland (I don’t mean that in a patriotic sense – but rather like a parasite’s care for “his” host). And maybe they have some good reason to fear. I sure hope that they do. 
I am rather encouraged by the way Trump handled the latest attempt to make him cower in fear. Yesterday Trump dared to declare that since the election might be rigged or stolen he does not pledge to recognize the outcome. And even though every semi-literate person knows that elections in the USA have been rigged and stolen in the past, including Presidential ones, by saying that Trump committed a major case of crimethink. The Ziomedia pounced on him with self-righteous outrage and put immense pressure on him to retract his statement. Instead of rolling over and recanting his “crime”, Trump replied that he will respect the election results if he wins. 
Beautiful no? Let’s hope he continues to show the same courage. 
Trump is doing now what Jean-Marie Le Pen did in France: he is showing the Neocons that be that he dares to openly defy them, that he refuses to play by their rules, that their outrage has no effect on him and that they don’t get to censor or, even less so, silence him. That is also what he did when, yet again, he refused to accuse the Russians of cyber-attacks and, instead, repeated that it would be a good thing for Russia and the USA to be friends. Again, I am not sure that how long he will be able to hold that line, but for the time being there is no denying that he is openly defying the AngloZionist deep state and Empire. 
Conclusion: The United States are about to enter what might possibly be the deepest and most dangerous crisis of their history. If Trump is elected, he will have to immediately launch a well-planned attack against his opponents without giving them any pretext to accuse him of politically motivated repressions. In Russia, Putin could count on the support of the military and the security services. I don’t know whom Trump can count on, but I am fairly confident that there are still true patriots in the US armed forces. If Trump gets the right person to head the FBI, he might also use that agency to clean house and deliver a steady streams of indictments for corruption, conspiracy to (fill the blank), abuse of authority, obstruction of justice and dereliction of duty, etc. Since such crimes are widespread in the current circles of power, they are also easy to prove, and cracking down on corruption would get Trump a standing ovation from the American people. Next, just as Putin did in Russia, Trump will have to deal with the media. How exactly, I don’t know. But he will have to face this beast and defeat it. At every step in this process he will have to get the proactive support of the people, just like Putin does. 
Can Trump do it? I don’t know. I would argue that to overthrow the deep state and restore the power of the people is even harder in the USA than it was in Russia. I have always believed that the AngloZionist Empire will have to be brought down from the outside, most probably by a combination of military and economic defeats. I still believe that. However, I might be wrong – in fact, I hope that I am – and maybe Trump will be the guy to bring down the Empire in order to save the United States. If there is such a possibility, however slim, I think that we have to believe in it and act on it as all the alternatives are far worse.

The Director of the FBI Reopens the Hillary Case — Paul Craig Roberts,"The Director of the FBI Reopens the Hillary Case
Paul Craig Roberts
Word has reached me from Washington that the FBI has reopened the Hillary case of her violation of US National Security protocols, not because of the content of the new email releases, but because voter support for Trump seems to be overwhelming, while Hillary has cancelled appearances due to inability to muster a crowd. The popular vote leaves the FBI far out on the limb for its corrupt clearance of Hillary. The agency now has to redeem itself.
I myself do not know what precisely to think. Having been at the top of the Washington hierarchy for a quarter century, I have seen many mistaken judgments. At one time I had subpoena power over the CIA and was able to inform President Reagan that the CIA had misled him. He took note and proceeded with his policy of ending the Cold War with the Soviets. On other issues I have been mistaken, because I assumed that there was more integrity in government than actually exists.
However, FBI director Comey did not need to reopen the case against Hillary simply because some new incriminating emails appeared. Having dismissed the other incriminating evidence, these emails could have passed unremarked. 
The problem for the FBI, which once was a trusted American institution, but no longer is, is that there is no longer any doubt that Donald Trump will win the popular vote for president of the United States. His appearances are so heavily attended that thousands are turned away by local fire/occupancy regulations. In contrast, Hillary has curtailed her appearances, because she doesn’t draw more than 30 or 40 people.
Americans are sick to death of the corrupt Clintons and the corrupt American media. The Clintons are so completely bought-and-paid-for by the Oligarchy that they were able to outspend Hollywood on their daughter’s wedding, dropping $3,000,000 on the event.
Nevertheless, I don’t underestimate the power of the Oligarchy. As Assistant Secretary of the US Treasury I experienced the Oligarchy’s power. If I had not been backed by the President of the United States, I would have been destroyed.
Indeed, the Oligarchy is still trying to destroy me.
Possibly Trump, as his enemies allerge, is just another fake, like Obama who misled the electorate. However, Trump attacks the Oligarchy so strongly that it is hard to believe that Trump isn’t real. Trump is asking for a bullet like John F. Kennedy, like Robert Kennedy, like Martin Luther King, like George Wallace. 
In Amerika, dissidents are exterminated. 
Trump is up against voting machines over which he has no control. If there are no INDEPENDENT exit polls, Trump can easily be robbed of the election, as the Texas early voting scandal indicates, with the electronic machines assigning Trump votes to Hillary. The “glitch” doesn’t assign any Hillary votes to Trump.
My expectation is that, unless Trump’s popular vote is so overwhelming, the electoral collage vote will be stolen. Because of the absence of any valid reporting by the presstitutes, I don’t know what impact the orchestrated election of Hillary would have on the electorate. Possibly, Americans will break out of The Matrix and take to the streets.
I beleve that Hillary in the Oval Office would convince the Russians and the Chinese that their national survival requires a pre-emptive nuclear attack on the crazed, insane government of the United States, the complete narcisstic state that in the words of Hillary and Obama is “the exceptional, indispensible country,” empowered by History to impose its will on the world. This crazed American agenda is not something that Russia and China will accept.
Here is Donald Trump speaking to Americans in words Americans have been waiting to hear:
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D8prvxjW2wM 
Notice that Trump doesn’t need teleprompters. 
I do not agree with Trump on many issues, but the American people do. For me and for the world, the importance of Trump is the prospect of peace with Russia. Nuclear war makes every other problem irrelevant. 
If Hillary is installed by the Oligarchy—this is a word used by former Democratic President Jimmy Carter who said that the US is no longer a functioning democracy but is ruled by an Oligarchy—war with Russia and China will be upon us.
After 15 years the Taliban and ISIS still run wild in the Middle East despite the efforts of the American “superpower.” Unable to defeat a few lightly armied Taiban after 15 years, what prospects does the enfeebled US have of winning a conflict with Russia and China?
None whatsoever.
The United States has had an entire generation of people born into a war for which the purpose is inexplicable. Why these wars? Why this endless slaughter of women and children and endless columns of refugees overwhelming all of Europe desperately striving to escape Washington’s wars of world hegemony. Why do not the total dumbshits in Washington hear when the President of Russia says that “Russia can no longer tolerate the state of affairs that Washington has created in the world.”
The unjustified arrogance of Washington, a washed up Third World State, is likely to destroy life on earth. No greater danger to life exists than Washington. We have to hope that Trump can clean out the Augean Stables.

I am surprised that Hillary and the presstitutes haven’t blamesd Putin for FBI director Comey’s reopening of the Hillary email case. But they have done the next best thing for Hillary. They have made Comey the issue, not Hillary.
According to US Senator Harry Reid and the presstitutes, we don’t need to worry about Hillary’s crimes. After all, she is only a political woman feathering her nest, like political men have been doing for ages. Why all this misogynist talk about Hillary? It is Comey’s alleged crime that is important. This woman-hating Republican violated the Hatch Act by telling Congress that the investigation he said was closed was reopened. A very strange interpretation of the Hatch Act. It is OK to tell that a candidate for president is cleared duing an election but not to say that a candidate is under investigation.
Comey violated the Hatch Act when he, on orders from the corrupt Obama Attorney General, announced Hillary clean, and thereby used the prestige of federal clearance of Hillary’s violation of national security protocols to boost her standing in the election polls.
Actually, Hillary’s standing in the polls is based on the pollsters over-weighting Hillary supporters in the polls. It is easy to produce a favorite if you overweight their supporters in the poll questions. If you look at the crowds attending the two candidate’s public appearances, it is clear that the American people prefer Donald Trump, who is opposed to war with Russia and China. The election settles no greater issue. 
This has the ruling American Oligarcy, for which Hillary is the total servant, concerned. What are they going to do about Trump? Will his fate be the same as John F. Kennedy, Robert Kennedy, Martin Luther King, George Wallace? Time will tell. Or will a hotal maid appear at the last minute in the way that the Oligarchy got rid of Dominic Strauss-Kahn? 
All of the American and Western feminists, progressives, and left-wing remnant fell for the obvious frame-up of Strauss-Kahn. After Strauss-Kahn was blocked from the Presidency of France and resigned as Director of the IMF, the New York authorities had to drop all charges against Strauss-Kahn. But Washington had succeeded in putting its French vassal in the presidency of France. 
This is how the American Oligarchy desroys those it suspects might not serve its interests. The corrupt self-sereving Oligarchy makes sure that it owns the government and the media, the think tanks and increasingly all of the major universities, and, of course, through the presstitutes, Amerians’ minds.
The Oligarhs are now hard-pressed to rescue Hillary as US president, so let’s see if the Oligarchs can once again deceive the insouciant American people.
While we wait, let’s concern outselves with another important issue. The Clinton crime syndicate in the closing years of the 20th century allowed a small handful of mega-corporations to consolidate the US media in a few hands. This vast increase in the power of the Oligarchy was accomplished despite US anti-trust law and the American tradition of a dispersed and independent media. 
But really, what does federal law mean to the One Percent. Nothing whatsoever. They are immune to it. Hillary’s crimes might cost her the election, but she won’t go to jail.
Not content with 90% control of the US media, the Oligarchy wants more concentration and more control. Looks like they will be getting it, thanks to the totally corrupt US government.
The Federal Trade Commission is supposed to enforce US anti-trust law. Instead, the corrupt federal agency routinely violates US anti-trust law by permitting monopoly concentrations of business interests. 
Because of the failure of the federal government to enforce federal law, we now have “banks too big to fail,” unregulated Internet monopoly, and the evisceration of a dispersed and independent media. 
There formerly was a field of economics known as anti-trust. Ph.D. candidates specialized in and wrote dissertations about public control of monopoly power. I assume that this field of
economics, like the America of my youth, no longer exists.

How Voting Machines Are Programmed In Order To Steal Elections,"How Voting Machines Are Programmed In Order To Steal Elections
Americans are being told by “experts” (read “Hillary supporters”) that election fraud in the US is rare. They are also being misinformed that voting fraud would be detected. The fact of the matter is, as has now been proven, that no vast conspiracy is required. One person suffices to have the machine count the votes as desired. Once the vote is recorded the code erases the elements that would reveal the fraud. 
The entire purpose of the presstitutes reporting a non-existent Hillary lead is to create in advance acceptance that she won, thereby discrediting in advance any challenge to the rigged outcome.

Don’t be afraid. Watch. The capacity to commit fraud exists; stop arguing about who’s using it, get it out, and in the meantime for this election, pay attention to vote-counting any way you can. Find out if you have ballot images and make sure they’re preserved for public record. Many officials destroy them because they can’t be fixed to match digital vote-shifting.
Accounting software was built into Diebold’s original digital counting system (Global Election Management System, or GEMS.) It has since migrated to ES&S, Sequoia, and Dominion, tallying votes in their DREs and their optical scanners. To work with the accounting software and use it to apply desired percentages to outcomes you only have to
1) know it’s there
2) know how to use it
3) have access before or during an election
4) know how to cover your tracks
Bennie Smith, the researcher who found the accounting program, was inspecting databases that Bev Harris had obtained in a court settlement some years back. (whole story at www.blackboxvoting.org)
He found a few screens showing fractionalized election results and thought “this reeks.” He was familiar with accounting software, and found a menu feature that turned whole numbers into fractions and back again at the click of a key. You need this in accounting, where cents on the dollar require precise totals. But for one person one vote? 
Bennie, who can write code, went to work developing a little app that could attach to code Bev had found online, in the early 2000s, in a file named ROB GEORGIA (that story is on www.blackboxvoting.org and was part of the movie Hacking Democracy.) Bennie applied the app to an old race in one of the election database Bev had obtained in court. He changed the results of the race, using the fraction menu, then returned it to whole numbers. https://youtu.be/Fob-AGgZn44 shows it being done in real time. He says the app could be attached by someone who knew what they were doing, and it could run during a live election as results came in – IF you wanted to commit election fraud. 
The only evidence one might see, in such a case, would perhaps be an occasional shift downward (loss) of votes already obtained by some candidates, if the fraudster chose a percentage that “showed.” (That’s why “the latest polls” and “margin of error” and “gap is closing” and “momentum” are important considerations. ) Because the app might have to “steal” from one candidate to another to keep within the commanded percentage. 
Wow! Activists taking screen shots of live election results have seen exactly this – and it’s explained away as “ glitch”! Hm.
Ok, so we know that hand-counted paper ballots, where there are opti-scan counts, are a necessity – either to a statistically-sufficient random audit or as fully redundant count. 
We also know that few paper ballot jurisdictions are set up with that infrastructure, in 2016, to do this. Some states have no audit laws. And what of DRE jurisdictions, with or without paper?
A SOLUTION HAS APPEARED IN THE COURT CASE JOHN BRAKEY JUST WON IN PIMA ARIZONA. 
Turns out that many of our opt-scanners and DREs (even those without paper!) make ballot images of cast ballots – opt-scanners create the image as the ballots are scanned, touchscreen as the voted onscreen ballot is “Cast”. AND turns out that these images are nearly impossible, CURRENTLY, to make match a fraudulent digital count. Too many pixels!
Any count shifted by an intruding set percentage cannot currently simultaneously change the ballot images to match. 
John Brakey found his Pima County officials destroying the ballot images and refusing to make them public record. Brakey got a court order from a judge that they must be preserved in November 2016 and made available for public inspection. 
The public could obtain a vote-count from these images even if officials refuse to hand-count. The ballot image vote count must match the”official” results or something has been manipulated in the “official” results. 
Brakey found further suspicious activity around the ballot images. The ES&S optical scanner used in Pima County also has a printer that stamps, on the back of each paper ballot, a unique iD number that is also given to the ballot image. It cannot be traced to the voter. It only matches the paper ballot with its image, as a check and balance for transparent audit. 
Pima County officials did not use the printer. They removed its cartridge. Their paper ballots did not have ID numbers. So, impossible to match to the images, which they were destroying anyway. 
The ID printer was part of the sales package ES&S offered to jurisdictions to states like AZ that have audit laws. Disabling it was against the law. 
The judge ordered Pima County to enable the printer by using a damn cartridge and have it running for the November, 2016, election.
Let’s stand up and demand election integrity using the means at our disposal. We are not to be shamed for insisting that our votes be counted as cast.

Can The Oligarchy Still Steal The Presidential Election? — Paul Craig Roberts,"Can The Oligarchy Still Steal The Presidential Election?
Paul Craig Roberts
The election was set up to be stolen from Trump. That was the purpose of the polls rigged by overweighting Hillary supporters in the samples. After weeks of hearing poll results that Hillary was in the lead, the public would discount a theft claim. Electronic voting makes elections easy to steal, and I have posted explanations by election fraud experts of how it is done.
Clearly the Oligarchy does not want Donald Trump in the White House as they are unsure that they could control him, and Hillary is their agent. 
With the reopening of the FBI investigation of Hillary and related scandals exploding all around her, election theft is not only more risky but also less likely to serve the Oligarchy’s own interests.
Image as well as money is part of Oligarchic power. The image of America takes a big hit if the American people elect a president who is currently under felony investigation. 
Moreover, a President Hillary would be under investigation for years. With so much spotlight on her, she would not be able to serve the Oligarchy’s interests. She would be worthless to them, and, indeed, investigations that unearthed various connections between Hillary and oligarchs could damage the oligarchs. 
In other words, for the Oligarchy Hillary has moved from an asset to a liability.
A Hillary presidency could put our country into chaos. I doubt the oligarchs are sufficiently stupid to think that once she is sworn in, Hillary can fire FBI Director Comey and shut down the investigation. The last president that tried that was Richard Nixon, and look where that got him. 
Moreover, the Republicans in the House and Senate would not stand for it. House Committee on oversight and Government Reform chairman Jason Chaffetz has already declared Hillary to be “a target-rich environment. Even before we get to day one, we’ve got two years worth of material already lined up.” House Speaker Paul Ryan said investigation will follow the evidence.
If you were an oligarch, would you want your agent under this kind of scrutiny? If you were Hillary, would you want to be under this kind of pressure? 
What happens if the FBI recommends the indictment of the president? Even insouciant Americans would see the cover-up if the attorney general refused to prosecute the case. Americans would lose all confidence in the government. Chaos would rule. Chaos can be revolutionary, and that is not good for oligarchs.
Moreover, if reports can be believed, salacious scandals appear to be waiting their time on stage. For example, last May Fox News reported: 
“Former President Bill Clinton was a much more frequent flyer on a registered sex offender’s infamous jet than previously reported, with flight logs showing the former president taking at least 26 trips aboard the “Lolita Express” — even apparently ditching his Secret Service detail for at least five of the flights, according to records obtained by FoxNews.com.
“Clinton’s presence aboard Jeffrey Epstein’s Boeing 727 on 11 occasions has been reported, but flight logs show the number is more than double that, and trips between 2001 and 2003 included extended junkets around the world with Epstein and fellow passengers identified on manifests by their initials or first names, including “Tatiana.” The tricked-out jet earned its Nabakov-inspired nickname because it was reportedly outfitted with a bed where passengers had group sex with young girls.”
Fox News reports that Epstein served time in prison for “solicitation and procurement of minors for prostitution. He allegedly had a team of traffickers who procured girls as young as 12 to service his friends on ‘Orgy Island,’ an estate on Epstein’s 72-acre island, called Little St. James, in the U.S. Virgin Islands.” http://www.foxnews.com/us/2016/05/13/flight-logs-show-bill-clinton-flew-on-sex-offenders-jet-much-more-than-previously-known.html 
Some Internet sites, the credibility of which is unknown to me, have linked Hillary to these flights. http://truepundit.com/breaking-bombshell-nypd-blows-whistle-on-new-hillary-emails-money-laundering-sex-crimes-with-children-child-exploitation-pay-to-play-perjury/ 
This kind of behavior seems reckless even for Bill and Hillary, who are accustomed to getting away with everything. Nevertheless, if you are an oligarch already worried about the reopened Hillary email case and additional FBI investigations, such as the one into the Clinton Foundation, and concerned about what else might emerge from the 650,000 emails on former US Rep. Weiner’s computer and the NYPD pedophile investigation, putting Hillary in the Oval Office doesn’t look like a good decision.
At this point, I would think that the Oligarchy would prefer to steal the election for Trump, instead of from him, rather than allow insouciant Americans to destroy America’s reputation by choosing a person under felony investigations for president of the United States.
Being the “exceptional nation” takes on new meaning when there is a criminal at the helm.

How the Oligarchy Has Prepared the Groundwork for Stealing the Election,"How the Oligarchy Has Prepared the Groundwork for Stealing the Election 
In addition to the cyber manipulation of electronic voting (see http://www.paulcraigroberts.org/2016/11/01/very-easy-to-invisibly-steal-us-elections/ ), Finian Cunningham explains a second method the Oligarchy has prepared that would allow the election to be stolen for Hillary. The groundwork that has been officially established indicates that a false flag cyber attack is the preferred method.
A Digital 9/11 If Trump Wins by Finian Cunningham 
There are disturbing signs that a digital 9/11 false flag terror attack is being readied for election day in the US to ensure that Donald Trump does not win. 
Such an attack – involving widespread internet and power outage – would have nothing to do with Russia or any other foreign state. It would be furnished by agencies of the US Deep State in a classic “false flag” covert manner. But the resulting chaos and “assault on American democracy” will be conveniently blamed on Russia. 
That presents a double benefit. Russia would be further demonized as a foreign aggressor “justifying” even harsher counter measures by America and its European allies against Moscow. 
Secondly, a digital attack on America’s presidential election day this week, would allow the Washington establishment to pronounce a Trump win invalid due to “Russian cyber subversion”. Invalidation is a prepared option if the ballot results show Republican candidate Donald Trump as the imminent victor. 
Democrat rival Hillary Clinton is the clear choice for the White House among the Washington establishment. She has the backing of Wall Street finance capital, the corporate media, the military-industrial complex and the Deep State agencies of the Pentagon and CIA. The fix has been in for months to get her elected by the powers-that-be owing to her well-groomed obedience to American imperialist interests. 
The billionaire property magnate Trump is too much of a maverick to be entrusted with the White House, as far as the American ruling elite are concerned. 
The trouble is that, despite the massive campaign to discredit Trump, polls show his support remains stubbornly close to Clinton’s. The latter has been tainted with too many scandals involving allegations of sleazy dealings with Wall Street, so-called pay-for-play favors while she was former Secretary of State, and her penchant for inciting overseas wars for regime change using jihadist terrorist foot-soldiers. 
As one headline from McClatchy News only days ago put it: “Majority of voters think Clinton acted illegally, new poll finds”. http://www.mcclatchydc.com/news/politics-government/election/article112635048.html#emlnl=Evening_Newsletter 
Trump is right. The US presidential election is rigged. The system is heavily stacked against any candidate who does not conform with the interests of the establishment. The massive media-orchestrated campaign against Trump is testimony to that. 
But such is popular disgust with Clinton, her sleaze-ball husband Bill and the Washington establishment that her victory is far from certain. Indeed in the last week before voting this Tuesday various polls are showing a neck-and-neck race with even some indicators putting the Republican narrowly ahead. 
Over the weekend, the Washington Post, which has been one of the main media outlets panning Trump on a daily basis, reported this: “The electoral map is definitely moving in Trump’s direction”. https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2016/11/04/dont-look-now-the-electoral-map-is-definitely-moving-in-donald-trumps-direction/?wpisrc=nl_headlines&wpmm=1 
In recent days, American media are reporting a virtual state of emergency by the US government and its security agencies to thwart what they claim are Russian efforts to incite “election day cyber mayhem.” 
In one “exclusive” report by the NBC network on November 3, it was claimed that: “The US government believes hackers from Russia or elsewhere may try to undermine next week’s presidential election and is mounting an unprecedented effort to counter their cyber meddling.” http://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/white-house-readies-fight-election-day-cyber-mayhem-n677636?cid=sm_tw 
On November 4, the Washington Post reported: “Intelligence officials warn of Russian mischief in election and beyond.” https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/russia-seen-as-unable-to-alter-election-but-may-still-seek-to-undermine-it/2016/11/03/b7387160-a1cd-11e6-8832-23a007c77bb4_story.html 
Apparently, the emergency security response is being coordinated by the White House, the Department of Homeland Security, the CIA, the National Security Agency and other elements of the Defense Department, according to NBC. 
These claims of Russian state hackers interfering in the US political system are not new. Last month, the Obama administration officially accused Moscow of this alleged malfeasance. https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/oct/07/us-russia-dnc-hack-interfering-presidential-election 
Russian President Vladimir Putin has lambasted American claims that his country is seeking to disrupt the presidential elections as “hysterical nonsense”, aimed at distracting the electorate from far more deep-rooted internal problems. http://abcnews.go.com/International/wireStory/putin-rejects-claims-russian-interference-us-election-43103312 
The Obama administration and its state security agencies have not provided one iota of evidence to support their allegations against Russia. Nevertheless the repeated charges have a tendency to stick. 
The Clinton campaign has for months been accusing Trump of being a “pro-Russian stooge”. Clinton’s campaign has also claimed that Russian hackers have colluded with the whistleblower organization Wikileaks to release thousands of private emails damaging Clinton with the intention of swaying the election in favor of Trump. 
Wikileaks’ director Julian Assange and the Russian government have both rejected any suggestion that they are somehow collaborating, or that they are working to get Trump elected. 
But on the eve of the election, the US authorities are recklessly pushing hysteria that Russia is trying to subvert American democracy. 
Michael McFaul, the former US ambassador to Russia from 2012 to 2014 is quoted as saying: “The Russians are in an offensive mode and the US is working on strategies to respond to that, and at the highest levels.” 
NBC cites a senior Obama administration official as saying that the Russians “want to sow as much confusion as possible and undermine our process”. 
Ominously, the news outlet adds that “steps are being taken to prepare for worst-case scenarios, including a cyber-attack that shuts down part of the power grid or the internet.” 
Nearly two weeks ago, on October 21-22, the US was hit with a widespread internet outage. The actors behind the “distributed denial of service” were not identified, but the disruption was nationwide and it temporarily disabled many popular consumer services. One former official at the US Department of Homeland Security described the event as having “all the signs of what would be considered a drill”. http://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/white-house-readies-fight-election-day-cyber-mayhem-n677636?cid=sm_tw 
Could that cyber-attack have been the work of US Deep State agencies as a dress rehearsal for an even bigger outage planned for November 8 – election day? 
The Washington establishment wants Clinton over Trump. She’s the marionette of choice for their strategic interests, including a more hostile foreign policy towards Russia in Syria, Ukraine and elsewhere. But Trump might prove to be the voters’ choice. In which case, the shadowy forces that really rule America can trigger a “digital 9/11”. 
It’s not difficult to imagine the chaos and mayhem from internet blackout, power, transport, banking and communications paralysis – even for just a temporary period of a few hours. Months of fingering Russia as a destabilizing foreign enemy intent on interfering in US democracy to get “Comrade Trump” into the White House would then serve as a self-fulfilling prophecy. In that event, the US authorities could plausibly move to declare the election of Donald J Trump null and void. 
In fact the scenario could be contrived to a far more serious level than merely invalidating the election result. The US authorities could easily feign that a state of emergency is necessary in order to “defend national security”. That contingency catapults beyond “rigged politics”. It is a green light for a coup d’état by the Deep State forces who found that they could not win through the “normal” rigging methods.

Stephen Lendman Sums Up The NYT,"Stephen Lendman Sums Up The NYT 
NYT Scare Tactics for Hillary 
by Stephen Lendman 
The Times shamelessly serves as Hillary’s press agent, masquerading as a legitimate source of news and information. 
On November 5, its editors hyped a nonexistent “catastrophe that looms if we wake up Wednesday morning to President-elect Trump…Averting the worst starts with electing Hillary Clinton,” they blustered. http://www.nytimes.com/2016/11/06/opinion/sunday/imagining-america-on-nov-9.html?_r=1 
Appealing to voters unwilling or dubious about supporting her, they ignored her high crimes and unfitness for any public office, calling Trump “an ignorant and reckless tyrant,” then asking: “(W)hat did you do to stop him” if he emerges triumphant? 
Claiming “Republican efforts to jam the electoral machinery through lies, legal obstructions and the threat of violence,” they ignored DNC rigged primaries for Hillary, urging voters to “hold out, however intimidating the process and long the lines.” 
The Times never served its readers responsibly, an exclusive voice for wealth, power and privilege. Its press agent journalism for Hillary turned itself into a laughing stock – disgracefully supporting a war criminal/racketeer/perjurer, the most recklessly dangerous presidential aspirant in US history, her elevation to the nation’s highest office risking nuclear war. 
Calling the Republican party “sick” ignores America’s deplorable political process too debauched to fix – money controlled fantasy democracy, voters having no say over who governs. 
“If Mr. Trump is rejected on Tuesday, the nation will have a momentary breather,” Times editors blustered, adding “(a)nd some good news to build on…(a)nd the electorate will have demonstrated its decency.” 
It’s hard imagining anyone swallowing this rubbish. Whoever emerges triumphant on November 8, ordinary people lose – with an important difference between Trump and Hillary. 
Her empowerment as commander-in-chief of America’s military risks unthinkable nuclear war. At least with Trump, we’re likely to avoid a potential catastrophe able to end life on earth – what Times editors won’t ever explain, shamelessly supporting a war goddess lunatic endangering everyone.

Eric Zuesse Notes That the Democratic Party, once the Party of the People, is now the Party of the Rich, and that the US Public Lacks Confidence in Elections 
Poverty Rose in 96% of U.S. House Districts, During Obama’s Presidency 
On November 3rd, Morning Consult’s Jon Reid bannered, “Poverty on the Rise in Nearly All House Districts” and he reported that, “A Brookings Institution study, released less than a week before the election, shows that the number of people living in poverty has increased in 96 percent of congressional districts between 2000 and 2010-2014.” 
That finding fits along with others, such as that the economic ‘recovery’ after Barack Obama came into the White House in 2009, went virtually entirely to the very rich. 
According to the top experts on wealth-inequality in the United States, Emmanuel Saez and Gabriel Zucman, American wealth-inequality soared faster during 2003-2013 than ever since the period 1923-1928, right before the Great Crash of 1929. Their study “Wealth Inequality in the United States Since 1913”, published in the May 2016 Quarterly Journal of Economics, reported that ever since the remilitarization of the U.S. from the 2003 invasion of Iraq onward (and continuing under Obama, with boosts to NATO, and invasions such as of Libya in 2011), the percentage of total wealth owned by the richest .1% of American families (those families whose net worth was $111 million or higher) rose from 15% of the total in 2003, to 22% of the total in 2013, and this means that the percentage going to the lower 99.9% declined from 85% down to 78% during that time. 
America’s soaring inequality during the George W. Bush Presidency continued unaffected by the 2009 change of Presidential Administrations. 
In fact: whereas Bush’s stock-market plunge in 2006-2008 hit the richest the hardest, Obama’s coming into office restored their lost wealth rapidly, while the wealth of the bottom 90% of the U.S. population flatlined throughout his Presidency. The Obama economic recovery was no recovery at all for the bottom 90% of Americans. 
Not just wealth but personal income also soared for the super-rich under Obama. The “Share of income earned by top 0.1% wealth holders” soared throughout Obama’s Presidency, at least up through 2012, which is the latest figure shown there for that. So: at least the bottom 90% of U.S. families have experienced none of the Obama economic recovery; what ‘recovery’ from the ‘recession’ there is, went only to the very rich. 
Findings such as those are consistent with, and might help to explain, the finding in the new Brookings study, that 96% of House districts have experienced increased poverty under Obama. The nation’s poor have gotten political rhetoric, but not much else, and the middle class also have received no net benefit, under Obama.

The Working Class Won The Election — Paul Craig Roberts,"The Working Class Won The Election
Paul Craig Roberts
The US presidential election is historic, because the American people were able to defeat the oligarchs. Hillary Clinton, an agent for the Oligarchy, was defeated despite the vicious media campaign against Donald Trump. This shows that the media and the political establishments of the political parties no longer have credibility with the American people.
It remains to be seen whether Trump can select and appoint a government that will serve him and his goals to restore American jobs and to establish friendly and respectful relations with Russia, China, Syria, and Iran.
It also remains to be seen how the Oligarchy will respond to Trump’s victory. Wall Street and the Federal Reserve can cause an economic crisis in order to put Trump on the defensive, and they can use the crisis to force Trump to appoint one of their own as Secretary of the Treasury. Rogue agents in the CIA and Pentagon can cause a false flag attack that would disrupt friendly relations with Russia. Trump could make a mistake and retain neoconservatives in his government.
With Trump there is at least hope. Unless Trump is obstructed by bad judgment in his appointments and by obstacles put in his way, we should expect an end to Washington’s orchestrated conflict with Russia, the removal of the US missiles on Russia’s border with Poland and Romania, the end of the conflict in Ukraine, and the end of Washington’s effort to overthrow the Syrian government. However, achievements such as these imply the defeat of the US Oligarchy. Although Trump defeated Hillary, the Oligarchy still exists and is still powerful.
Trump said that he no longer sees the point of NATO 25 years after the Soviet collapse. If he sticks to his view, it means a big political change in Washington’s EU vassals. The hostility toward Russia of the current EU and NATO officials would have to cease. German Chancellor Merkel would have to change her spots or be replaced. NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg would have to be dismissed. 
We do not know who Trump will select to serve in his government. It is likely that Trump is unfamiliar with the various possibilities and their positions on issues. It really depends on who is advising Trump and what advice they give him. Once we see his government, we will know whether we can be hopeful for the changes that now have a chance. 
If the oligarchy is unable to control Trump and he is actually successful in curbing the power and budget of the military/security complex and in holding the financial sector politically accountable, Trump could be assassinated. 
Trump said that he will put Hillary in prison. He should first put her on trial for treason and war crimes along with all of the neoconservatives. That would clear the decks for peace with the other two major nuclear powers over whom the neoconservatives seek hegemony. Although the neoconservatives would still have contacts in the hidden deep state, it would make it difficult for the vermin to organize false flag operations or an assassination. Rogue elements in the military/security complex could still bring off an assassination, but without neocons in the government a coverup would be more difficult.
Trump has more understanding and insight than his opponents realize. For a man such as Trump to risk acquiring so many powerful enemies and to risk his wealth and reputation, he had to have known that the people’s dissatisfaction with the ruling establishment meant he could be elected president. 
We won’t know what to expect until we see who are the Secretaries and Assistant Secretaries. If it is the usual crowd, we will know Trump has been captured.
A happy lasting result of the election is the complete discrediting of the US media. The media predicted an easy Hillary victory and even Democratic Party control of the US Senate. Even more important to the media’s loss of influence and credibility, despite the vicious media attack on Trump throughout the presidential primaries and presidential campaign, the media had no effect outside the Northeast and West coasts, the stomping grounds of the One Percent. The rest of the country ignored the media.
I did not think the Oligarchy would allow Trump to win. However, it seems that the oligarchs were deceived by their own media propaganda. Assured that Hillary was the sure winner, they were unprepared to put into effect plans to steal the election. 
Hillary is down, but not the Oligarchs. If Trump is advised to be conciliatory, to hold out his hand, and to take the establishment into his government, the American people will again be disappointed. In a country whose institutions have been so completely corrupted by the Oligarchy, it is difficult to achieve real change without bloodshed.

Progressives Find ‘White Trash’ More Threatening Than Nuclear War — Paul Craig Roberts,"Progressives Find ‘White Trash’ More Threatening Tnan Nuclear War
Paul Craig Roberts
The American electorate’s preference for Donald Trump and Bernie Sanders has established two facts. One is that the majority of the American people do not believe the media presstitutes. The other is that only the “progressives” and “liberals” who inhabit the Atlantic Northeast and Pacific West coasts believe the presstitutes.
Trump’s election to the presidency has confirmed these holier-than-thou souls in their strongly held belief that America is a white trash racist country. They have told us this all day long today.
From these people and from the presstitutes we hear that white supremacy elected Trump. This is their propaganda, the intention of which is to discredit a Trump administration before it is inaugerated. Funny how white supremacy elected black Obama twice previously.
Truthout has lost it completely. John Knefel declares “The David Dukes of the World Prevail.”
Kelly Hayes declares “White Supremacy Elected Donald Trump.”
William Rivers Pitt declares “We have elected a fascist that Mussolini would have recognized on sight.”
Hillary carried only a handful of states, the states that comprise the One Percent’s stomping grounds. Yet Amy Goodman of Democracy Now sees meaning in political writer John Nichols claim that as Hillary carried New York and California, she won the popular vote and should be in the White House. I remember a few days ago George Soros saying that Trump would win the popular vote, but that the electoral vote would go to Hillary, thus ridding the oligarchs of Trump.
Earth Justice promises to hold Trump accountable. Trump who promises to end the threat of nuclear war with Russia and China, thereby doing more to save animal and human life than the entirety of the Democratic Party and environmental organizations, is going to be held accountable by an organization that allegedly is beyond politics and is dedicated to preserving animals from destruction.
The ACLU, of which I am a member, has also put “on notice” the president-elect who has said he will save us from nuclear war. Faced with this idiocy from the ACLU, I will not renew my membership.
Feminists tell us that we are “grieving, scared, and in shock,” and that “it is critical that we stand together and support each other.”
Jeremy Ben-Ami of the J Street Jewish Community tells us that it is “an incredibly sad and difficult day. For tens of millions of Americans who share a core belief in tolerance, decency and social justice, the election results are a severe shock. In this challenging moment, we turn to one another for comfort and community. During this election, J Street made unequivocally clear our conviction that Donald Trump is not fit to be president of the United States.”
Van Jones, a CNN commentator, said that Trump’s election is a nightmare, “a deeply painful moment,” a “whitelash” against minorities. While he bemoaned the pain inflicted upon poor little presstitute Van Jones, he didn’t mind insulting the American electorate and the President-elect of the United States. After all, Van Jones sees that as his racist prerogative.
And so, the holier-than-thou crowd prefers Hillary, despite her unambigious position that she would maximize conflict with Russia and China, provoke direct military conflict between the US and Russia by imposing a no-fly zone in Syria, attack Iran and other of Israel’s targets, further enrich her Wall Street handlers by privatizing Social Security, and prevent any dissent from the lowly people class of her high-handed ways. If William Rivers Pitt sees Trump as a Mussolini fascist, Trump is too mild for Pitt. He prefers Hillary, a Hitler to the third power.
The progressives have totally discredited themselves just as the presstitutes have done. Their need for a bogyman to nourish their hysteria indicates serious psychological disturbance. They actually prefer the risk of Armageddon to peace among nuclear powers. As their 501(c)3s live off corporate contributions, they prefer globalist corporate profits to jobs for ordinary Americans.
These are the people who think of themselves as our instructors and our betters. 
If only Trump could exile the lot of them. They are anti-American to the core.

The Anti-Trump Protesters Are Tools of the Oligarchy — Paul Craig Roberts,"The Anti-Trump Protesters Are Tools of the Oligarchy
“Reform always provokes rage on the part of those who profit by the old order.” Arthur M. Schlesinger, Jr., The Crisis of the Old Order 
Paul Craig Roberts
Who are the anti-Trump protesters besmirching the name of progressives by pretending to be progresives and by refusing to accept the outcome of the presidential election? They look like, and are acting worse than, the “white trash” that they are denouncing.
I think I know who they are. They are thugs for hire and are paid by the Oligarchy to delegitimize Trump’s presidency in the way that Washington and the German Marshall Fund paid students in Kiev to protest the democratically elected Ukrainian government in order to prepare the way for a coup. 
The organization, change.org, which claims to be a progressive group, but might be a front, along with other progressive groups, for the Oligarchy, is destroying the reputation of all progressives by circulating a petition that directs the electors of the Electoral Collage to annul the election by casting their votes for Hillary. Remember how upset progressives were when Trump said he might not accept the election result if there was evidence that the vote was rigged? Now progressives are doing what they damned Trump for saying he might do under certain conditions. 
The Western presstitutes used the protests in Kiev to delegitimize a democratically elected government and to set it up for a coup. The protest pay was good enough that non-Ukrainians came from nearby countries to participate in the protest in order to collect the money. At the time I posted the amounts paid daily to protesters. Reports came in to me from Eastern and Western Europe from people who were not Ukrainian but were paid to protest as if they were Ukrainians. 
The same thing is going on with the Trump protests. CNN reports that “for many Americans across the country, Donald Trump’s victory is an outcome they simply refuse to accept. Tens of thousands filled the streets in at least 25 US cities overnight.” This is the exact reporting that the Oligarchy desired from its presstitutes and got.
I hope no one thinks that simultaneous protests in 25 cities were a spontaneous event. How did 25 independent protests manage to come up with the same slogans and the same signs on the same night following the election?
What is the point of the protests, and what interest is served by them? As the Romans always asked, “who benefits?”
There is only one answer: The Oligarchy and only the Oligarchy benefits.
Trump is a threat to the Oligarchy, because he intends to stop the giveaway of American jobs to foreigners. The jobs giveaway, sanctified by the neoliberal junk economists as “free trade,” is one of the main reasons for the 21st century worsening of the US income distribution. Money that was formerly paid in middle class wages and salaries to American manufacturing employees and college graduates has been re-routed to the pockets of the One Percent. 
When US corporations move their production of goods and services sold to Americans offshore to Asian countries, such as China and India, their wage bill falls. The money formerly paid in middle class incomes goes instead into executive bonuses and dividends and capital gains to shareholders. The ladders of upward mobility that had made America the land of opportunity were dismantled for the sole purpose of making a handful of people multi-billionaires. 
Trump is a threat to the Oligarchy, because he intends peaceful relations with Russia. In order to replace the profitable Soviet Threat, the Oligarchy and their neoconservative agents worked overtime to recreate the “Russian Threat” by demonizing Russia. 
Accustomed to many decades of excess profits from the profitable Cold War, the military/security complex was angry when President Reagan brought the Cold War to an end. Before these leaches on American taxpayers could get the Cold War going again, the Soviet Union collapsed as a result of a right-wing coup against Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev. 
The military/security complex and their zionist neoconservative agents cooked up “the war on terror” to keep the money flowing to the One Percent. But as hard as the presstitute media worked to create fear of “the Muslim threat,” even insouciant Americans knew that the Muslims did not have thousands of ICBMs carrying powerful thermo-nuclear weapons capable of destroying the entirety of the United States in a few minutes. Neither did the Muslims have the Red Army capable of overrunning all of Europe in a couple of days. Indeed, the Muslims haven’t needed an army. Refugees from Washington’s wars enabled by Europeans are overrunning Europe.
The excuse for the annual trillion dollar ($1,000 billion ) military/security budget was missing. So the Oligarchy created “the New Hitler” in Russia. Hillary was the Oligarchy’s principle agent for heating up the new Coldl War.
Hillary is the tool, enriched by the Oligarchy, whose job as President was to protect and to increase the trillion dollar budget of the military/security complex. With Hillary in the White House, the looting of the American taxpayers in behalf of the wealth of the One Percent could go forward unimpeaded. But if Trump resolves “the Russian threat,” the Oligarchy takes an income hit.
Hillary’s job as President was also to privatize Social Security in order that her Wall Street benefactors can rip off Americans the way that Americans have been ripped off by the insurance companies under Obamacare.
Those Americans who do not pay attention think, mistakenly, that the FBI cleared Hillary of violating National Security protocals with her email practices. The FBI said that Hillary did violate National Security, but that it was a result of carelessness or ignorance. She got off from indictment, because the FBI concluded that she did not intentionally violate National Security protocals. The investigation of the Clinton Foundation continues.
In other words, in order to protect Hillary the FBI fell back on the ancient common law rule that “there can be no crime without intent.” (See PCR and Lawrence Stratton, The Tyranny of Good Intentions .) 
One would think that protesters, if they were legitimate, would be celebrating Trump’s victory. He, unlike Hillary, promises to reduce tensions with powerful Russia, and we hope also with China. Unlike Hillary, Trump says he is concerned with the absence of careers for those very people protesting in the streets of 25 cities against him. 
In other words, the protests against the American people for electing Trump as their president are pointless. The protests are happening for one reason only. The Oligarchy intends to delegitimize the Trump Presidency. Once President Trump is delegitimized, it will be easier for the Oligarchy to assassinate him. Unless the Oligarchy can appoint and control Trump’s government, Trump is a prime candidate for assassination. 
The protests against Trump are suspicious for another reason. Unlike Hillary, Obama, and George W. Bush, Donald Trump has not slaughtered and dislocated millions of peoples in seven countries, sending millions of refugees from the Oligarchy’s wars to overrun Europe.
Trump earned his fortune, and if by hook or crook, not by selling US government influence to foreign agents as Bill and Hillary did. 
So what are the protesters protesting? 
There is no answer except that they are hired to protest. Just as the Maidan protesters in Kiev were hired to protest by US and German financed NGOs.
The protests in Kiev were equally pointless, because presidential elections were only months away. If Ukranians really believed that their president was conspiring with Russia to keep Ukraine from becomming a Western puppet state and wished to become a puppet state regardless of the costs, the opportunity to vote the government out was at hand. The only reason for the protests was to orchestrate a coup. The US did succeed in putting their agent in control of the new Ukrainian government as Victoria Nuland and the US ambassador in Kiev confirmed in their telephone conversation that is available on the Inernet. 
The Maidan protests were pointless except for making a coup possible. The protests were without any doubt arranged by Washington through Assistant Secretary of State Victoria Nuland, a neoconservative brought into the State Department by Hillary Clinton for the purpose of creating conflict with Russia.
Trump is being protested in order to make him vulnerable in the event he proves to be the threat to the Oligarchy that he is thought to be.
Trump won the presidency, but the Oligarchy is still in power, which makes any real reforms difficult to achieve. Symbolic reforms can be the product of the contest between President Trump and the oligarchs.
Karl Marx learned from historical experience, and Lenin, Stalin, and Pol Pott learned from Karl Marx, that change cannot occur if the displaced ruling class is left intact after a revolution against them. We have proof of this thoughout South America. Every revolution by the indigenious people has left unmolested the Spanish ruling class, and every revolution has been overthrown by collusion between the ruling class and Washington.
Washington has conspired with traditional elites to remove the elected presidents of Honduras on a number of occasions. Recently, Washington helped elites evict the female presidents of Argentina and Brazil. The presidents of Venezuela, Ecuador, and Bolivia are in the crosshairs and are unlikely to survive. Washington is determined to get its hands on Julian Assange. To achieve this Washington intends to overthrow the Ecuadoran governmenrt that, in defiance of Washington, gave Julian Assange political asylum.
Hugo Chavez had the power to exile or to exterminate the Spanish ruling class in Venezuela when the ruling class participated in a CIA coup against Chavez. But before the CIA could kill Chavez, the people and the military forced his release. Instead of punishing the criminals who would have murdered him, Chavez let them go.
According to Marx, Lenin, and Stalin, this is the classic mistake of the revolutionary. To rely on good will from the overthrown ruling class is the certain road to the defeat of the revolution.
Latin American has proved itself unable to learn this lesson: Revolutions cannot be concillatory. 
Trump is a dealmaker. The Oligarchy can permit him the sheen of success in exchange for no real change.
Trump is not perfect. He might fail on his own. But we should back him on the two most important elements in his program: to reduce tensions between the major nuclear powers, and to halt Washington’s policy of permitting globalism to destroy Americans’ economic prospects. 
If tensions between nuclear powers worsen, we won’t be here to worry about other problems. The combination of the economy hollowed out by globalism and immigration is an economic nightmare. That Trump understands this is reason to support him.
Note: Some believe that Trump is a ruse conducted by the Oligarchy. However, as Hillary is the bought-and-paid-for representative of the Oligarchy, such an elaborate ruse is unnecessary. It is preferable for the Oligarchy to win on its own platform than to install a president on the opposite platform and then change him around. Another sellout increases the anger of the people. If Hillary had won, the Oligarchy would have had the voters’ mandate for their platform.

The press prostitutes continue to lie to us. They pretend that the anti-Trump protests are real spontaneous events although the prostitutes know that the “protests” are orchestrated by George Soros and front groups for the Oligarchy such as change.org and other fake progressive groups funded by the oligarchs.
Soros, change.org and various progressive and leftwing fronts for the oligarchs pretend to be for democracy, but they are acting in behalf of Oligarchy. We are witnessing a direct attack on American democracy. These protesters are the hired mercenary enemy of the American people.
Below is an email I received from a friend in Massachusetts. They preach peace and love while they commit violence: 
Below is one of the emails I rec’d regarding immediate organizing to get rid of Trump. JWJ is Jobs for Justice serving Massachusetts with the main group in Boston and the subsidiary in western MA. You appear to be correct, because I rec’d the notice below the day following the election and election results were not even in until 3:00 a.m. Moveon.org was/is behind this one. Moveon.org is link under 3rd local event.
Dear JWJ and allies,
If you were like me, today was a hard day to get up. Donald Trump is
the president-elect, and last night Republicans took the House, the
Senate, and thus the Supreme Court. This is a terrible situation for
humanity, let alone the workers’ movement and our ability to expand
organizing and collective bargaining rights. And yet, there is no time
to really brood about it. We are called to take immediate action.
Today, we are joining with others throughout the movement to demonstrate
our non-consent with the election results, in particular the election of
Donald Trump. This evening, thousands will gather in cities across the
nation to affirm to ourselves and one another that we will not give up
the fight-the fight for a nation with liberty and justice for all. We
will stand with one another, across race, religion, gender, age,
ability, national origin, sexual orientation, and all of our identities.
We will join hands, pledge our solidarity, and resolve to forge ahead
even in this moment of peril and challenge. See local events below. 
Check out moveon.org/standtogether.
In these most difficult of political moments, we have to come together
and stand stronger. Never has the “I ‘ll
Be There” pledge been more necessary than today. 
In struggle,

"This Wasn’t A Vote, It Was An Uprising","This Wasn’t A Vote, It Was An Uprising 
Dear Readers: The article below has come to me. I am unable to ascertain if it is a published statement or one of those items sent around the Internet. Nevertheless, I do believe that it captures the attitude of those Americans who in the vast majority of the states gave their vote to Donald Trump.
The optimism expessed in the article might be unrealistic. In order to prevail over the Oligarchy, President Trump will need a government as strong as he appears to be. He cannot find the strength he needs for his government among the usual Washington, Wall Street, and corporate sources. If he selects from these people, he will be impotent.
The question is: who is his transition team? Are they focused on making nice with the Oligachs? If so, there will be no change. 
The Democratic Party failed America for the eight years of the Clinton Regime, which committed war crimes and overthrew a sovereign government on the basis of lies. The George W. Bush Regime originated the Middle East wars entirely on the basis of lies. These wars have resulted in the deaths, maiming, and dislocation of millions of peoples who have sought refuge from America’s aggression in Europe. The corrupt Obama Regime has continued and expanded Bush’s illegal wars and stupidly brought the US into conflict with Russia and China, either one of which can destroy the United States of America.
Now we have the psychopath George Soros funding hired protesters, who are bussed from protest to protest, in an effort to delegitimize the Trump presidency. This is an act of treason, but oligarchs such as Soros are above the law. They are never held accounable. Trump should arrest Soros and put him on trial.
Trump says that he wants to bring the oligarchs under the law. If he fails, America fails with him.
This wasn’t an election. It was a revolution. 
By Daniel Greenfield, a Shillman Journalism Fellow at the Freedom Center
It was midnight in America. The day of the election millions Americans got up and stood in front of the Machine, the great iron wheel that had been grinding them down. They stood there even though the media told them it was useless. They took their stand even while all the chattering classes laughed and taunted them as white trash racists.
They were fathers who couldn’t feed their families anymore. They were mothers who couldn’t afford health care. They were workers whose jobs had been given to foreigners in foreign countries so that the incomes of oligarchs could rise. They were sons who didn’t see a future for themselves. They were daughters afraid of being raped by the undocumented illegals flooding into their towns. They took a deep breath and they stood.
They held up their hands and the great iron wheel stopped.
Blue America crumbled. The Blue States fell one by one. Ohio. Wisconsin. Pennsylvania. Iowa. The white working class that had been overlooked and trampled on for so long got to its feet. It rose up against its oppressors. The rest of the nation, between the West coast and the North East coast–the fly-over zone– rose up with it.
They fought back against their jobs being shipped overseas while their towns filled with migrants that got everything while they got nothing. They fought back against a system in which they could go to jail for a trifle while the elites could violate the law and still stroll through a presidential election.
They fought back against being told that they had to watch what they say. 
They fought back against being held in contempt because they wanted to work for a living, take care of their families, and protect the sanctity of marriage.
And they won.
This wasn’t a vote. It was an uprising. 
Like the ordinary men chipping away at the Berlin Wall, they tore down an unnatural thing that had towered over them. And as they watched it fall, they marveled at how weak and fragile it had always been. And how much stronger they were than they had ever known.
Who were these people? They were the neglected in the fly-over country that is the heart of America. They didn’t have univeristy degrees, and they had never set foot in a Starbucks to pay $5 for a cup of coffee. They were the white working class. They didn’t talk right or think right. They had the wrong ideas, the wrong clothes and the ridiculous idea that they still mattered.
They were told they were wrong about everything. Illegal immigration. Black Lives Matter, but not jobs for the oppressed middle class. Manufacturing is unnecessary for an economy in which financial profits are all important. Transgendered bathrooms. Same gender marriages. Americans were supposed to bow down and surrender to a handful of perverts.
Told that the future belongs to the metrosexual dot com transgendered globalist, and not to the guy who once had a good job before the globalist corporations with Washington’s blessings sent it to China or Mexico, real Americans revolted. 
White trash American couldn’t change anything, declared the pundits. But instead of adapting to the inevitable future of America’s demise, they got in their pickup trucks and drove out to vote.
And they changed everything. 
Barack Hussein Obama boasted that he had changed America. And he did for the worse. A billion regulations, millions of immigrants, a hundred thousand lies and it was no longer our America. 
White Trash America voted and sent Obama to Hell. They walked through him and through the Democratic Party like the wet paper bag that they are. Voters abandoned the party that had sold out the American people. More black Americans voted for Trump than voted for Romney. 
The election repudiated the Obamas, the Clintons, the celebrities, and the media. Americans turned the One Percent’s world upside down.
CNN is weeping. MSNBC is wailing. ABC calls it a tantrum. NBC damns it. It wasn’t supposed to happen. The same machine that crushed the American people for six straight terms, the mass of neoconned government, globalist corporations and oligarch-financed non-profits that ran the country, was set to win. Or so they thought.
Instead the people stood in front of the Machine. They blocked it with their votes even though the media told them Hillary was the certain winner. They mailed in their absentee ballots even while Hillary Clinton was planning her fireworks victory celebration. They looked at the empty factories and barren farms. They drove through the early cold. They waited in line. They came home to their children to tell them that they had done their best for their future. They bet on America. And they won.
They sre tired of the absence of affordable health care and recognize the fraud of Obamacare. They are tired of unemployment and of being lied to. They are tired of watching their sons come back in coffins so that the military/security complex could continue to loot America with their wars. They are tired of being called names and watching the theft of their country. 
They understood that Trump was right. The election was their last hope, their last chance to save themselves and their country. And they did.
This election was not about who gets to use the female toilet. It wasn’t about whether it is racist to enforce the immigration laws. It wasn’t about how men, however uncouthly, express their sexual interest in women.
It was about suffering Americans, whose names no one except a server and the NSA will ever know, fighting back against their oppression. It was about the homeless woman guarding Trump’s star. It was about the betrayed Democrats searching for someone to represent them in Ohio and Pennsylvania. It was about the union men who refused to sell out their futures and vote for a Democrat who is an agent of the One Percent.
The media will never interview those men and women. We will never see their faces. But they are us and we are them. They came to the aid of a nation in peril. They did what real Americans have always done. They did the impossible.

Evidence Building Against Soros,"Evidence Building Against Soros
George Soros Funded Trump Protests:
http://sjlendman.blogspot.com 
This one might be wishful thinking:
http://usdefensewatch.com/2016/11/putin-issues-international-arrest-warrant-for-george-soros-dead-or-alive/ 
A reader writes that Soros
“is involved in destabilizing and overthrowing democratically elected governmenbts all over the world. He is not just a political and social threat to Russia and Ukraine, but evidently now to the USA and Western Europe, where he has been behind the mass influx of immigrants to destabilise those countries as well. 
“It is clear that Trump and Putin have a lot of threats in common to deal with. The shadow government is currently rattled, but will strike back soon. After the recent violent events, Trump should join the Russian government and also call for the immediate arrest of Soros for his treasonous activities and confiscate all his assets in the West, appoint special prosecutors to deal with the neocon war criminals and break up the bought and paid for press and media monopolies that are the corrupt and mendacious whores of the oligarchy. Furthermore, he should also shut down the oligarchs’ Fed and create a national bank to issue debt- and interest-free US money to fund infrastructure and the rebuilding of the US economy. That would critically weaken the opposition and strengthen his position in dealing with the shadow government. 
“These forces will be eternal enemies not just of him, but of the Western people. They represent a cancer that is killing the host. Not reconciliation, but deep and thorough cleaning is required to rout out this den of vipers.”
The audacity of George Soros is extraordinary. How does he get away with it?

Trump’s Opponents See Normal Americans as Deplorables — Paul Craig Roberts,"Trump’s Opponents See Normal Americans as Deplorables
Paul Craig Roberts
I guess we have all noticed that the holier-than-thou groups who whined that Trump wasn’t going to accept the outcome of the election refuse to accept it themselves.
Because I was critical of the George W. Bush regime, the liberal-progressive-leftwing and homosexual/transgendered rights groups have me on their mailing lists. 
And it is unbelievable. The entirety of “the other America” refuses to accept the people’s decision. They think that their concerns are more important than the concerns of the American people, who they regard as nothing but a collection of racist homophobic rednecks. 
Unless they provoke him beyond reason, Trump is not going to bother any of these people.
Trump wants to bring middle class jobs back to Americans, including for all those paid to protest him.
In order to avoide nuclear war, Trump wants to restore normal relations between the major nuclear powers. 
When there are no jobs for Americans that pay enough to support an independent existence, Trump doesn’t see the point of massive legal and illegal immigration.
This is only common sense.
Yet “the threatened people” see it as fascism.
Who are “the threatened people?” As always, the most powerful.
Tell me, what lobby is more powerful than the Israel Lobby? You can’t. But the Jewish Lobby, J Street, has sent me a hysterical email at 5:11pm on 14 November. Unless “we all come together and oppose Trump’s appointment of Breitbart editor Stephan Bannon as chief strategist and senior counselor” a “wave of hate will sweep across the land,” consuming “Jews, Muslims, African-Americans, LGBT peoople (lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgendered), immigrants, Hispanics, women and other groups.”
Really now! So is Trump’s chief strategist, whatever position that is, going to attack the Jews and those with unusual sexual impulses with drones and cluster bombs, like the zionist neoconservatives who controlled the Clinton, George W. Bush, and Obama regimes did to millions of slaughtered and displaced peoples in 7 countries, and like Israel does to Palestinians? Or is the former Breitbart editor going to round them all up and torture them in Abu Ghraib and Guantanamo like Bush and Obama did. And like Netanyahu does in Israel?
Or will Trump simply shoot them down in the streets like Netanyahu does to the Palestinian women and children. 
How come J Street and the Oligarchy-funded fronts are only concerned with nonexistent threats and ignore all of the real threats?
According to J Street, the main concern is that Trump has appointed an “Alt-Right” person to advise him. Dangerous tensions between nuclear powers? A collapsing American middle class?
These concerns, if present, are in the peripheral vision of the “threatened people.” 
According to the front group known as the Southern Poverty Law Center, Trump’s election by fly-over America has resulted in “over 250 reports of hate crimes around the country.” Is the Southern Poverty Law Center including the brutal beating of a white man by a gang of blacks? How many innocents has Trump slaughtered and put into concentration camps? How many countries has he invaded? The corrupt American media and oligarchic front groups have created “the new Hitler” before he is even inaugerated.
The Klingon Clintons and neoconed Bush/Cheney and Obama killing regimes have murdered more people and invaded more countries than Hitler, and the holier-than-thou group doesn’t care. Yet, the all-powerful Israeli Lobby thinks a Breibart editor is going to target the Jews, immigrants, the transgendered and homosexuals, women, Muslims, Hispanics, “and other groups.” What a change this will be. Only non-immigrant, white, heterosexual males will be in the protected group known as the “preferred minority.”
We must hope that Donald Trump understands the state of moral, cultural, legal, and political collapse that America is in. Two years ago at the Valdai International Discussion Club, Russian President Vladimir Putin said:
“Many of the Euro-Atlantic countries are actually rejecting their roots, including the Christian values that constitute the basis of Western civilization. They are denying moral principles and all traditional identities, national, cultural, religious, and even secular. They are implementing policies that equate families with same-sex partnerships, worship of God with worship of Satan. I am convinced that this opens a direct path to degradation and primitivism, resulting in a profound demographic and moral crisis.”
Ordinary Americans know what he means. They are forced to accept blasphemous films about Jesus Christ and shameless newspaper caricatures of the Virgin Mary, but if one of them calls a homosexual a pervert, he has committed a hate crime.
America is a country without an honest media. A country wihout an honest judiciary. Without an honest government. Without an honest legislature. Without honest schools and universities. A country whose morals are confused by propaganda. A country whose elites believe that they are entitled to all the income and wealth and that normal American people are the “deplorables,” to use Hillary’s term for ordinary Americans.

It Is Up To Us — Paul Craig Roberts,"It Is Up To Us
Paul Craig Roberts
Did Donald Trump win the election because he is a racist and misogynist and so are the American people? 
No. That’s BS from the Oligarchs’ well-paid whores in the media, “liberal progressive” activist groups, think tanks and universities.
Did Trump win because he stole the election?
More BS. The Oligarchs controlled the voting machines. They failed to steal the election, because the people outsmarted them and told the pollsters that they were voting for Hillary. This led to the presstitutes’ propaganda that Hillary was the certain winner, and the Oligarchs believed their own propaganda and didn’t believe it necessary to make certain of their victory.
Trump won the presidency because he spoke directly and truthfully to the American people, telling them what what they knew to be true and had never before heard from any politician:
“Our movement is about replacing a failed and corrupt political establishment with a new government controlled by you, the American people. The establishment has trillions of dollars at stake in this election. Those who control the levers of power in Washington and the global special interests they partner with, don’t have your good in mind. The political establishment that is trying to stop us is the same group responsible for our disastrous trade deals, massive illegal immigration and economic and foreign policies that have bled our country dry.
“It’s a global power structure that is responsible for the economic decisions that have robbed our working class, stripped our country of its wealth and put that money into the pockets of a handful of large corporations and political entities. The only thing that can stop this corrupt machine is you. The only force strong enough to save our country is us. The only people brave enough to vote out this corrupt establishment is you, the American people.”
Trump did not promise voters a bunch of handouts. He didn’t say he would fix this and that. He said that only the American people could fix our broken country and identified himself as an agent of the people.
The people won the election, but the Oligarchy is still there, as powerful as ever. They have already launched their attack using their whores in the media and liberal progressive groups in attempts to delegitimize Trump with protests, petitions, and endlessly false news reports. George Soros, using the money he made by his attack on the British currency, will pay thousands of protesters to attempt to disrupt the inaugeration. 
What about Trump’s government? As Trump discovered, finding appointees who are not part of the Oligarchy’s economic and foreign policy establishment is very difficult.
Washington is not a home for critics and dissidents. Consider Pat Buchanan, for example. As a White House official in two administrations and a two-time presidential candidate, he is experienced, but Washington has marginalized him. 
Moreover, even if there were a stable of outsiders, they would be eaten alive by the insiders. Trump will have to take insiders. But he has to pick insiders who are to some extent their own person. General Michael Flynn as National Security Advisor is not a bad pick. Flynn is the former head of the Defense Intelligence Agency who advised the Obama regime against employing ISIS against Syria. Flynn has publicly stated on television that the appearance of ISIS in Syria was a “willful decision” of the Obama regime. In other words, ISIS is Washington’s agent, which is why the Obama regime has protected ISIS.
Trump’s chief of staff (Priebus) and chief strategist (Bannon) are reasonable choices.
Sessions (Attorney General) and Pompeo (CIA) are disturbing appointments based on their media-created reputations. But in the US where there is no honest media, we don’t know the truth of the reputations. Nevertheless, if Sessions does support torture, he is disqualified as attorney general, because the Constitution prohibits torture. The US cannot afford yet another attorney general who does not support the US Constitution.
If Pompeo actually is so poorly informed that he opposed the Iran settlement, he is not fit to be CIA director. The CIA itself said that Iran had no nuclear weapons program, and with Russia’s help the matter was resolved. Does Trump want a CIA director who neoconservatives could use to restart the conflict?
The views of Sessions and Pompeo could be products of the time and not visceral. Regardless, Trump is a strong and willful person. If Trump wants peace with the Russians and Chinese, appointees who get in the way will be fired. So let’s see what a Trump government does before we damn it.
Presstitute reports of extreme neoconservative John Bolton and former US attorney and NY Mayor Rudy Giuliani being candidates for Secretary of State do not seem credible. If Trump intends to get along with Putin, how can he do that if his Secretary of State wants war with Russia? Trump should find an experienced diplomat who negotiated with the Soviets. Richard Burt, who had a major role in the Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty, is the sort of person it would make sense to consider. Another sensible candidate would be Jack Matlock, Reagan’s Ambassador to the Soviet Union.
If Trump wants peace with Russia, the Secretary of State is the important appointment.
If Trump wants to stop the Oligarchy’s rip off of the American people, the Secretary of the Treasury is the important appointment. 
Under the last three presidents, treasury secretaries have been agents for the banks-too-big-to-fail and for Wall Street. It is now a tradition for the financial gangsters to own the Treasury. It remains to be seen if the tradition is too strong for Trump to break.
The Oligarchy is trying to discredit the Trump Presidency before it exists. This effort is discrediting liberal and progressive groups by identifying them with nonenforcement of the immigration laws and with homosexual and transgender rights, issues not on the agenda of an electorate whose economic fortunes have been declining and who are tired of 15 years of war that serves only the hegemony agenda of the neoconservatives and the profits and power of the military/security complex. 
According to The Saker, Putin has begun removing the Atlanticist Integrationists, Russia’s Fifth Column, from influence. Let’s see if Trump can remove our fifth columnists—neoconservatives and neoliberal economists—who have sold out the American people and America’s integrity.
If Trump fails, the only solution is for the American people to become more radical.

Trump the Great — Paul Craig Roberts,"Trump the Great
Paul Craig Roberts
Liberals, progressives, and the left-wing (to the extent that one still exists) are aligning with the corrupt oligarchy against president-elect Trump and the American people. 
They are busy at work trying to generate hysteria over Trump’s “authoritarian personality and followers.” In other words, the message is: here come the fascists.
Liberals and progressives wailed and whined about “an all white male cabinet,” only to be made fools by Trump’s appointment of a black male and two women, one a minority and one a Trump critic.
The oligarchs are organizing their liberal progressive front groups to disrupt Trump’s inauguration in an effort to continue the attempt to delegitimize Trump the way the paid Maidan protesters were used in Kiev to delegitimize the elected Ukrainian government.
To the extent any of the Trump protesters are sincere and not merely paid tools of oligarchs, such as George Soros, military and financial interests, and global capitalists, they should consider that false claims and unjustified criticism can cause Trump and his supporters to close their ears to all criticism and make it easier for neoconservatives to influence Trump by offering support.
At this point we don’t know what a Trump government is going to do. If he sells out the people, he won’t be reelected. If he is defeated by the oligarchy, the people will become more radical. 
We do not know how Washington insiders appointed to the government will behave inside a Trump presidency. Unless they are ideologues like the neoconservatives or agents of powerful interests, insiders survive by going along with the current. If the current changes under Trump, so will the insiders. 
Trump got elected because flyover America has had all it can take from the self-dealing oligarchy. The vast bullk of America has seen its economic prospects and that of children and grandchildren decline for a quarter century. The states Hillary carried are limited to the liberal enclaves and oligarchy’s stomping grounds on the NE and West coasts and in Colorado and New Mexico, where effete wealthy liberals have located because of the scenary. If you look at the red/blue electoral map, geographically speaking Hillary’s support is very limited.
We know that Hillary is an agent for the One Percent. The Clintons $120 million personal wealth and $1.6 billion personal foundation are proof that the Clintons are bought-and-paid-for. We know that Hillary is responsible for the destruction of Libya and of much of Syria and for the overthrow of the democratically elected government in Ukraine. We know that the Clinton regime’s sanctions on Iraq resulted in the deaths of 500,000 children. These are war crimes and crimes against humanity. We know Hillary used government office for private gain. We know she violated national security laws without being held accountable. What we don’t know is why groups that allegedly are liberal-progressive-leftwing are such fervent supporters of Hillary.
One possible answer is that these groups are mere fronts for vested interests and are devoid of any sincere motives.
Another possible answer is that these groups believe that the important issues are not jobs for Americans and avoiding war with nuclear powers, but transgender, homosexual and illegal alien rights.
Another possible answer is that these groups are uninformed and stupid.
What these protesters see as a threat in Trump’s strong and willful personality is actually a virtue. A cipher like Obama has no more ability to stand up to the oligarchy than a disengaged George W. Bush so easily stage-managed by Dick Cheney. Nothing less than an authoritarian style and personality is a match for the well-entrenched ruling oligarchy and willful neoconservatives. If Trump were a shrinking violet, the electorate would have ignored him.
Trump did not purchase his presidency with the offer of handouts to blacks, the poor generally, teachers unions, farmers, abortion rights for women, etc. Trump was elected because he said: “Those who control the levers of power in Washington and the global special interests they partner with, don’t have your good in mind. It’s a global power structure that is responsible for the economic decisions that have robbed our working class, stripped our country of its wealth and put that money into the pockets of a handful of large corporations and political entities. The only thing that can stop this corrupt machine is you.”
It has been a long time since the electorate heard this kind of talk from someone seeking public office. Trump’s words are what Americans were waiting to hear.
As willful as Trump is, he is only one person. The oligarchy are many.
As impressive as Trump’s billion dollars is, the oligarchs have trillions.
Congress being in Republican hands will spare Trump partisan obstruction, but Congress remains in the hands of interest groups. 
As powerful as the office of the president can be, without unity in government changes from the top don’t occur, especially if the president is at odds with the military with regard to the alleged threat posed by Russia and China. Trump says he wants peace with the nuclear powers. The military/security complex needs an enemy for its budget.
It is absolutely necessary that a lid be put on tensions between nuclear powers and that economic opportunity reappears for the American people. Trump is not positioned to benefit from war and jobs offshoring. The only sensible strategy is to support him on these issues and to hold his feet to the fire.
As for the immigration issue, the Obama Justice (sic) Department has just worsened the picture with its ruling that American police departments cannot discriminate against non-citizens by only hiring citizens as officers. Now that US citizens face arrest in their own country by non-citizens, the resentment of immigrants will increase. Clearly it is nonsensical to devalue American citizenship in this way. Clearly it is sensible to put a lid on immigration until the US economy is again able to create jobs capable of sustaining an independent existence. 
If Trump can defeat the oligarchy and save America, he can go down in history as Trump the Great. I think that this prospect appeals to Trump more than more wealth. Instead of trying to tear him down in advance, he should be supported. With Trump’s determination and the people’s support, change from the top down is possible. Otherwise, change has to come from the bottom up, and that means an awful lot of blood in the streets.

Trump Throws A Fit When Asked Why He Is Promoting His Hotel Instead Of Campaigning,"Donald Trump had himself a tantrum on CNN after he was asked why he was spending the day promoting his hotel instead of campaigning in swing states.

With just 13 days until election day, CNN’s Dana Bash asked Trump why he is promoting his hotel instead of campaigning in swing states, “I say the following: You have been covering me for the last— long time. I did yesterday eight stops and three major speeches, and I’ve been doing this for weeks straight. For you to ask me that question is actually very insulting because Hillary Clinton does one stop and then she goes home and sleeps. And yet you’ll ask me that question. I think that’s a very rude question, to be honest with you.” 
Trump can’t defend why he is wasting precious time promoting his business interests instead of campaigning. Trump doesn’t have a single campaign event scheduled until 7 PM. He has given up a critical day of campaign time to get publicity for his new hotel. 
When Trump got called out for some very unpresidential scheduling priorities, his response was to attack the reporter. 
The Republican nominee is not behaving like a person who is willing to give everything to be elected the next president, and every time he leaves his Fox News bubble, Donald Trump opens his mouth and reminds voters of why he should never be elected president.

Hillary Clinton could probably spend 24 hours a day for the rest of the campaign doing nothing but targeting Trump’s hypocrisies. 
While Trump was trying to drum up business for his struggling new DC hotel, Hillary Clinton was winning more early votes in the state of Florida. There are two competing messages in the media currently about the election. The first message is that Democrats are blowing out Republicans in early voting. The second message is that a few state polls have shown Trump leading by a little in Florida and gaining ground in New Hampshire. 
It is possible that both of these stories are correct. Democrats are blowing out Republicans in early voting, and with no new sex assault stories dominating the news, some Republicans may be coming back to Trump. 
The important thing for Hillary Clinton and Democrats is not to let up. Democrats are very close to generation defining win, but victory is not sealed yet. More polling will need to be done to see if the two state polls were outliers or if this is a trend, but the polls may not matter. 
If most of the ballots in states like North Carolina and Florida are cast before election day, the polls may end up meaning very little. 
Hillary Clinton is in a great position, but judging from her own remarks, she is still working hard to close the deal on November 8.

The AP-GfK Poll has Hillary Clinton leading Donald Trump by 14 points nationally 51%-37%, “The AP-GfK poll finds that Clinton has secured the support of 90 percent of likely Democratic voters, and also has the backing of 15 percent of more moderate Republicans. Just 79 percent of all Republicans surveyed say they are voting for their party’s nominee.” 
Earlier in the day, two Bloomberg polls that had Trump leading Florida by 2 points, and cutting Clinton’s New Hampshire lead in half gave Republicans a bit of hope that the presidential election might be tightening, but the reality is that voting is already underway in 37 states. There are very few undecided voters remaining. 
Outside of tracking polls, Donald Trump hasn’t had a polling lead since July . Besides his brief July bump, Trump hasn’t led Clinton in national polling since May. What the media and Republicans don’t want to tell you is that this presidential election has been remarkably consistent. 
There is nothing in the polling to suggest that the election is tightening, or that Trump has significantly improved his odds of winning.

"Former GOP Congressman Goes Full Trump, Encourages Armed Revolt If Clinton Wins","By Sean Colarossi on Wed, Oct 26th, 2016 at 7:36 pm This type of language from someone who used to be a member of the United States Congress is abhorrent, but it's also to be expected in the Trump era of American politics. Share on Twitter Print This Post 
Hopefully, as a country, we’ll return to a time in our politics when violent language is shocking and rare. But this year, when the man at the top of the Republican ticket has repeatedly encouraged his supporters to revolt if he loses, isn’t likely to be that time. 
On Wednesday, former GOP Congressman Joe Walsh, a right-wing extremist who now hosts a talk radio show, followed his nominee’s lead and told urged his Twitter followers to grab their guns on Nov. 9 if Hillary Clinton is elected. 
Tweet: On November 8th, I’m voting for Trump. 
On November 9th, if Trump loses, I’m grabbing my musket. 
You in? 
— Joe Walsh (@WalshFreedom) October 26, 2016 
This type of language from someone who used to be – and thankfully no longer is – a member of the United States Congress is abhorrent, but it’s also to be expected in the Trump era of American politics. 
After all, not long ago Trump himself instructed his supporters to revolt if Clinton decides to fulfill her constitutional duty and nominate Supreme Court judges. 
“If she gets to pick her judges, nothing you can do, folks,” the Republican nominee said. “Although the Second Amendment people — maybe there is, I don’t know.” 
More recently, Trump said that he’d like to see what happens if Clinton’s bodyguards were disarmed. 
“I think her bodyguards should drop all weapons. Disarm immediately,” he said. “Take their guns away, let’s see what happens to her.” 
Not only does Walsh’s rhetoric align perfectly with what Trump has suggested at various points throughout this campaign, but it’s also a continuation of dangerous language that the former Republican congressman seems to enjoy using. 
Earlier in the year, when five police officers were gunned down in Dallas, Walsh blamed President Obama, tweeting: “This is now war. Watch out Obama. Watch out black lives matter punks. Real America is coming after you.” 
Before Trump hit the scene, this type of rhetoric existed, but it often only came from the most extreme elements in either party. Now it has the encouragement of a major party presidential nominee. 
On Nov. 9, we shouldn’t hope that people take up arms to protest the results of the election. We should hope that when Trump loses, he’ll take a lot of this dangerous rhetoric with him.",1
"Conservatives Already Plotting To Block Clinton’s SCOTUS Picks, Let Court ‘Die Out’","By Sean Colarossi on Wed, Oct 26th, 2016 at 8:34 pm Not even an overwhelming victory by Hillary Clinton is likely to convince Republicans that they should do their job. Share on Twitter Print This Post 
Since Republicans have essentially conceded that Donald Trump is going to lose the general election to Hillary Clinton, they’re already making plans in the event that she decides to do her job and nominate Supreme Court justices. 
According to a report from the Huffington Post on Wednesday, one conservative thinker says that John McCain’s recent suggestion that his party should block any nominee put forward by Clinton isn’t that farfetched. 
The report: 
Some conservatives certainly seem to be warming up to McCain’s controversial suggestion last week that Senate Republicans should dig in their heels and block any and all Supreme Court nominees put forth by a future President Hillary Clinton. 
Who needs a fully functioning Supreme Court after all? 
“As a matter of constitutional law, the Senate is fully within its powers to let the Supreme Court die out, literally,” wrote the Cato Institute’s Ilya Shapiro in a column Wednesday on The Federalist. 
Shapiro is well-versed in constitutional issues, and his argument has a legal, if contorted, basis. Nothing in the Constitution explicitly stands in the way of senators who would be willing to destroy the nation’s highest court ― if not an entire branch of the federal government ― to stop Clinton from selecting judges who share her views. 
… 
To Shapiro, there’s nothing wrong with even more Senate obstructionism because “the Constitution is completely silent” on how the upper chamber provides its “advice and consent” on the president’s nominees. 
… 
“So when you get past the gotcha headlines, breathless reportage, and Inauguration Day, if Hillary Clinton is president it would be completely decent, honorable, and in keeping with the Senate’s constitutional duty to vote against essentially every judicial nominee she names,” he concluded. 
The original argument from Republicans was that they would block President Obama’s Supreme Court appointment until voters had a chance to weigh in via the Nov. 8 election. Forget the fact that this isn’t how the constitutional system is meant to operate, but that was their reasoning. 
Now, faced with the growing prospect that Hillary Clinton will be elected the 45th President of the United States, they are beginning to change their tune. 
The obstruction that defined the Republican Party throughout Obama’s presidency looks like it will be sticking around after he is gone. It’s yet another reason why down-ballot races are more critical than ever this year.",1

Trump Repeats Bogus Claim That Captain Khan Would Still Be Alive If He Were President," 58 pm Again, Donald Trump was not opposed to the war in Iraq.   
Ever since Donald Trump was lambasted by leaders in both parties for fighting with a Gold Star family and dishonoring the service of Captain Humayun Khan, he’s been trying out a new approach: pretending Khan would still be alive if he was president. 
Khan was killed in 2004 in a suicide attack in Iraq. 
When the Republican was asked in an interview with ABC’s George Stephanopoulos if he thinks he should apologize for the way he treated the Khan family following the Democratic National Convention, he repeated this bogus claim. 
Video: . @realDonaldTrump stands by claim slain U.S. Army Capt. Humayun Khan would still be alive if he had been president. https://t.co/VgLaQ0cJ3A pic.twitter.com/bcDiTMXY2k 
— ABC News Politics (@ABCPolitics) October 26, 2016 
Trump said, “I have great respect for the Khan family, I have great respect for – I mean their son is a great hero – but if I were president at that time, Capt. Khan would be alive today, George, because I wouldn’t have been in Iraq … I was opposed to the war in Iraq.” 
As Hillary Clinton and many objective sources have noted repeatedly throughout the campaign, Donald Trump was not opposed to the war in Iraq from the beginning. Had he been president at the time, the war still would have taken place because Trump was in favor of it. 
In fact, Trump’s campaign rhetoric today indicates that he would be a president who acts recklessly and would only embolden our enemies. This would make the world a more dangerous place and only increase the odds that America gets mired in more conflicts, not less. 
For their part, the Clinton campaign has continued to stand up to Trump’s attacks on the Khan family. In an emotional new ad released days ago, Capt. Khan’s father recounts how his son died protecting “everyone in his unit.” Khan’s father asked of Trump, “Would my son have a place in your America?” 
The answer to Mr. Khan’s question is a resounding “no,” as Trump has promised to ban Muslims – like the Khans – from even entering the United States. For those living here already, a President Trump would treat them like criminals. 
Donald Trump will likely continue to rewrite history when it comes to his initial support of military intervention in Iraq. But after spending so much time throwing mud at the Khan family, it’s unlikely that anybody will buy it.",1
Trump Has Gotten The Republican Party Sued For Trying To Intimidate Voters,"The Washington Post reported : 
The Democratic National Committee has filed papers in federal court against the Republican National Committee, accusing it of violating a 1982 court order intended to prevent voter intimidation. 
The motion filed in New Jersey says the RNC has supported the efforts of presidential candidate Donald Trump’s campaign “to intimidate and discourage minority voters from voting in the 2016 Presidential Election.” Trump has recently been urging his supporters to monitor polling places on Election Day. 
Democrats aren’t going to stand by and let Trump supporters waltz into polling places in heavily Democratic areas to intimidate voters. 
Trump’s call for his supporters to go to polling places that aren’t their own to watch voters is a clear violation of the consent decree. 
The Republican Party, which has completely abandoned the idea of winning elections based on ideas, is firmly standing behind their nominee because the same party that was too weak to stop Trump during the primary is certainly not going to stand in the way of what might be their only chance of winning. 
People should not be afraid to go to the polls and vote. No matter who you are voting for, Democrats have your back. The Republican Party has been trying to suppress the vote and intimidate voters for years. 
Democrats are on to their tricks, and as the lawsuit demonstrates, Trump and the GOP are not going to get away with intimidating voters.",1
"Stung By Clinton Allegations, Trump Claims He Used No Undocumented Workers in DC Hotel","By Hrafnkell Haraldsson on Thu, Oct 27th, 2016 at 7:56 am Trump used undocumented labor to build Trump Tower and workers told The Washington Post in 2015 they were working on his hotel illegally   
So Donald Trump has responded to Hillary Clinton’s accusation that he used undocumented workers to build his new D.C. hotel, a 263-room luxury hotel just blocks from the White House. Trump claims he used no undocumented workers – and as we saw earlier , oh yeah, Hillary Clinton sleeps three days at a time. 
Trump’s decision to attend the grand opening rather than campaign raised many eyebrows, not just in the Clinton camp. Republican strategist Steve Schmidt told MSNBC, 
“He is not doing any of the normal activities that you’d be doing 13 days out in a presidential race for somebody who’s competitive. You don’t take a time-out to tend to your business interests.” 
As Libby Nelson wrote at Vox , “Clinton is making her closing argument. Trump is making infomercials.” 
All this seems to have stung the thin-skinned Trump, who previously set aside his campaign to open a golf course in Scotland. As CBS News’ Sopan Deb tweets , Trump’s defense was a little odd, to say the least: Trump's riff on his hotel is worth your time to read. Denies ever using undocumented immigrants and says Clinton sleeps for 3 days at a time pic.twitter.com/Rlsbebzk2Y 
— Sopan Deb (@SopanDeb) October 27, 2016 
The Republican nominee protested to CNN’s Dana Bash , “For you to ask me that question is actually very insulting because Hillary Clinton does one stop, and then she goes home and sleeps.” It is literally impossible for Trump to hear criticism without responding by attacking somebody else. 
Trump’s defense reveals a man who is overly sensitive to criticism: he “works all the time” while Clinton sleeps “for three days.” He says he took “an hour off” (it was a bit more than that) to open his new hotel while “she wants to sleep all the time.” 
He says Clinton gives one speech and then sleeps for three days. In fact, Clinton made two “Get Out the Vote” stops in Florida yesterday; she makes an appearance with the president and first lady today in North Carolina and has two appearances scheduled in Iowa for the day after. 
And Trump’s heated denial of using undocumented workers is unconvincing, considering his track record in that regard. 
It is a fact, as Hillary Clinton said yesterday, that Donald Trump “once again” used undocumented labor to build a hotel. He used undocumented labor to build Trump Tower . And The Washington Post reports that “Trump’s new downtown D.C. hotel was built thanks to the efforts of a large workforce that included Hispanic construction workers, including some workers who say they are undocumented .” Said one worker in 2015, “The majority of us are Hispanics, many who came illegally.” 
The old saw about the man who protests too much comes to mind, in reading Trump’s denial. This is a man who has a history of exploiting undocumented immigrants and according to the workers themselves, this remains true. 
Nonsensical talk about his opponent sleeping for three days straight is pure deflection, and it won’t work. Trump already has his clothing lines made in China, Mexico, and elsewhere, and he has used undocumented labor even while railing against the loss of American jobs. 
Trump is a hypocrite, and hissy fits and deflection are no answer to the allegations against him, and certainly no recommendation for the office of president.",1
The Media Ignores the Good News On Climate Change,"By Rmuse on Thu, Oct 27th, 2016 at 10:36 am To avoid climate-ending global temperature rise, it is critical for the world to transition off fossil fuels and embrace renewable, clean energy sources. Share on Twitter Print This Post *The following is an opinion column by R Muse* 
Over the past few months, there has been a dearth of good news, and if there did happen to be anything good to report it was overshadowed by the national clown show that is a typical American election. Where there has not been one iota of good news is on climate change. Even dismissing the horrible flooding, wildfires, droughts, sea level rise, melting ice caps, hurricanes and worldwide food shortages, there have only been dire reports on the level of CO2 permeating the atmosphere and the subsequent yearly record-setting rise in global temperatures. 
This week, while most Americans were living, breathing and bleeding over Donald Trump and the tortuously-long presidential campaign, the International Energy Agency offered up some good news; for the climate, the Earth’s population, and even for America. 
The good news for the planet came in the form of an announcement on Tuesday by the International Energy Agency (IEA) that stated according to new data, for the first time “Renewable energy sources have passed coal as the largest new source of electricity in the world.” 
It may not seem like such fantastic news, but climate scientists the world over have warned that if human beings are going to avoid that climate-ending 2-degree C rise in global temperatures, it is critical for the world to transition off of carbon-producing fossil fuels and embrace renewable, clean energy generating sources. This is particularly true for getting off dirty coal-fired electrical generation plants that are responsible for a quarter of America’s C02 emissions. Carbon dioxide emissions are one of the main culprits contributing to climate change driven by global warming. 
The IEA report revealed that solar and wind account for nearly two-thirds of current renewable energy growth and interestingly those increases are occurring in, and coming from, developing and industrialized nations alike. For a developing nation, it makes perfect sense to embrace cheaper renewable energy as opposed to any fossil fuel-generated power sources whether they are dirty coal-fired plants or not-quite-as-dirty natural gas-burning generating plants. 
The IEA also revised its earlier projections for renewable energy’s continued expansion and growth and “ significantly increased” the amount of “ green energy ” it expects to “ come on line ” over the next five years. Renewable energy includes so-called “green” sources such as biomass, biogas, eligible biomass and small hydroelectric sources, according to the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). Both terms, “renewable and green energy,” include solar and wind generating sources and depending on the context they can be interchangeable. 
In addition to pro-renewable policies (such as the Paris climate agreement and to a lesser extent the America-China deal to roll back coal-generated emissions, there has been a significant price decline that is helping drive the growth in renewables; particularly in solar. And, the IEA projected that the worldwide costs for solar-generated power will continue declining by an additional 25 percent over the next five years. Onshore wind generated electricity costs will drop by at least another 15 percent during that same five-year period. 
Although the IEA report was incredibly good news for the entire planet, there was some extra good news in the report about America’s transition to renewable energy. According to the IEA’s Medium-Term Renewable Market Report, the United States is adding renewables at a faster rate than demand is growing. What that means for the climate is that renewables are not only covering the ever-increasing demand for electricity but are now supplanting some fossil fuel electricity. Still, America has a long way to go because wind and solar generating sources make up a small portion of America’s electricity. 
In time and if the Koch brothers allow it, America may catch up to still-developing nations where renewable energy accounts for about half of new electric power sources. Industrialization is fueling a rapid increase in demand for electricity that is best generated with cheaper renewable energy. 
Although there appears to be no down-side in this bit of good news, the growth of renewable energy does have economic implications. The dirty coal industry is facing some struggles in part due to the glut of oil and lower national gas prices, financial mismanagement, and new clean-air regulations, but the amount of CO2 driving climate change is a testament that they have had a good long reign in providing dirty fuel to generate electricity. It is noteworthy that as coal jobs may be declining the solar industry is growing and thriving to more than take up the slack in any lost coal jobs. 
The IEA couldn’t pass up the chance to note one “sticking point” in their otherwise encouraging report; “ persistent challenges of heating and transportation energy ” that renewables are not affecting. However, since the IEA only monitored and tracked the world’s transistor from oil and gas to biofuels, they note that as electric and hybrid vehicles continue to increase around the world, they will be connected to the same electrical grid that is steadily getting a little greener, significantly cheaper, and one Hell of a lot more friendly for the climate and the people. 
It is a mystery how Republicans beholden to the Koch brothers and dirty fossil fuel industry, particularly the dirty coal industry, will absorb this good news. In the past eight years, Republicans , the Kochs, their lobbyists at the Heritage Foundation, Americans for Prosperity, and the American Legislative Exchange Council (ALEC) have made killing renewable energy one of their primary goals. It is likely that the IEA’s report will signal they are not winning the war on renewable energy and in the past that may have been worrisome. But now that more Americans are benefitting from renewable energy, particularly solar, Republicans will have a difficult time convincing them to stop getting free electricity from the Sun and saving the climate for their children’s future; something the IEA’s report never mentions.

Trump Campaign Admits They Are Trying To Steal The Election With Voter Suppression,"Bloomberg reported : 
To compensate for this, Trump’s campaign has devised another strategy, which, not surprisingly, is negative. Instead of expanding the electorate, Bannon and his team are trying to shrink it. “We have three major voter suppression operations under way,” says a senior official. They’re aimed at three groups Clinton needs to win overwhelmingly: idealistic white liberals, young women, and African Americans. Trump’s invocation at the debate of Clinton’s WikiLeaks e-mails and support for the Trans-Pacific Partnership was designed to turn off Sanders supporters. The parade of women who say they were sexually assaulted by Bill Clinton and harassed or threatened by Hillary is meant to undermine her appeal to young women. And her 1996 suggestion that some African American males are “super predators” is the basis of a below-the-radar effort to discourage infrequent black voters from showing up at the polls—particularly in Florida. 
The effort was obvious, and according to the polling, it is failing. 
Voter turnout among young women is expected to rise according to the latest Harvard IOP young voters poll. Sanders started flocking towards Clinton in August , and haven’t left, and early voting statistics show that African-American turnout is solid in swing states. 
The Trump campaign has realized that they don’t have enough supporters to win, so they are adopting tactics that run contrary to the heart of democracy to shrink the electorate in critical states. 
However, for voter suppression efforts like Trump’s to be effective, the campaign must have a credible messenger. Donald Trump is not a credible messenger to any of the voters that he is trying to deter, and he has no effective surrogates that are capable of delivering his message. 
A voter suppression effort was expected from the Trump campaign. What is unexpected is that the campaign would publicly brag about it. 
People on all sides of the political spectrum who care about basic democratic institutions should be alarmed by Trump’s public attack on democracy. 
The good news for all Americans is that Democrats are already fighting back , and the Trump campaign’s dark efforts to steal an election appear to be failing.",1
Democrats May Get A 2 For 1 Special As Trump Defeat Could Take Out Paul Ryan,"By Jason Easley on Thu, Oct 27th, 2016 at 12:16 pm Rep. Paul Ryan could be out of a job after the election, as divided House Republicans are already plotting to fire their Speaker if Trump's defeat triggers a big enough loss of House seats. Share on Twitter Print This Post 
Rep. Paul Ryan could be out of a job after the election, as divided House Republicans are already plotting to fire their Speaker if Trump’s defeat triggers a big enough loss of House seats. 
If Democrats pick up 15 House seats or more, Speaker Ryan is going to have a major problem because his job will be in jeopardy. Politico reported that Ryan’s enemies in the House Freedom Caucus are divided over whether or not to support him. 
Conservative House Republicans are plotting with one another and openly pining for Ryan’s ouster because he refuses to change the House rules to all more conservative legislation to be passed. The Hill is also reporting that conservativeHouse Republicans are deeply divided on keeping Ryan, but Donald Trump could be the wild card that mobilizing an opposition effort to the Speaker, “The businessman has repeatedly criticized Ryan’s leadership and was stung after the Speaker said he would not longer defend Trump after a 2005 tape emerged in which the GOP nominee speaks lewdly about groping and kissing women. Win or lose on Nov. 8, Trump could put pressure on House Republicans to oppose Ryan in a speakership contest.” 
Ryan is certain to be leading a smaller House majority in January. The size of Trump’s defeat on election day will help decide how many seats Republicans lose. 
Eight of the nine House Republicans who cast votes against Ryan for Speaker initially will still be around to vote against him again in January. 
Those close to Ryan say that he would step down as Speaker before getting into a protracted fight with his own party, but the walls are closing in on Speaker Ryan. 
The damage Trump is causing isn’t limited to their White House dreams. Trump may also cost Paul Ryan his job as Speaker of the House.",1
"With Donald Trump Tanking, a Trump Supporter Waves Her Hillary in a Noose Doll at Rally","At a Donald Trump rally in North Carolina, a proud Ginger Glover waved a “Lyin’ Hillary Doll” with a special edition noose on it. 
Watch a clip with Glover at the Wednesday rally here via NBC News : 
Glover said the noose was her way of making a point that Hillary Clinton should be “incarcerated at the very least,” but when asked said she doesn’t think Clinton should be killed. 
Yet her employees put the noose on the doll for her and she brought it out in public and waved it around. For “effect.” 
Where is all of the Trump rallies’ violent rhetoric and imagery going? 
Donald Trump seems to attract people who are angry and want someone to blame. 
The Washington Post did an incredible story on Melanie Austin, a Trump supporter who said Trump sees the world like she does. She realized this days after she had been injected with something intended to “calm” her, after she was involuntarily committed for homicidal ideation against President Obama. 
The first time she had seen him, at a rally in June, she was just beginning to realize how many people saw the world the way she did, that she was one among millions. At the time, her hips were still sore from a series of injections intended to calm her. She had gotten them in February, during a difficult time in her life, when she had been involuntarily hospitalized for several weeks after what she called a “rant,” a series of online postings that included one saying that Obama should be hanged and the White House fumigated and burned to the ground. On her discharge papers, in a box labeled “medical problem,” a doctor had typed “homicidal ideation.” 
Donald Trump and the alt-right, and indeed way too many elected Republicans, have already pointed these folks at Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama as Evil People Who Must Be Harmed. When you attract unstable people who are easily manipulated out of anger and fear and then direct them to harm someone, as Trump and his advisers have done suggesting Hillary Clinton might be shot and saying she should be executed with a firing squad, you are responsible for inciting violence. 
Things are not going well for Trump supporters, and even buoyed as they are with unscientific online polls and delusions fed by the alt-right media and Fox News, they smell defeat. 
Perhaps that’s not connected to this specific woman who brought a Hillary Clinton doll in a noose to wave at a Trump rally last night, but it is a trend we’re seeing in general – angry Trump fans using more and more violent rhetoric. 
There will be more of this, not less, as Trump’s likely defeat becomes reality outside of tinfoil circles. 
This is political intimidation that mimics Donald Trump’s despotic promises to jail Clinton even though she’s been cleared of wrong-doing in all of the relentless Republican investigations into her activities as Secretary of State. 
Of which there will be plenty more, Republicans promise us, should she win — because just like the Trump camp doesn’t want you to vote, Republicans only want government to work when they’re not in power. 
The potent mixture of tinfoil and rage is creating a toxic brew of violent fantasies and rhetoric among Trump supporters.

"Number Of Accusers Grows To 12, As Former Miss Finland Accuses Trump of Sexual Assault","By Sarah Jones on Thu, Oct 27th, 2016 at 1:41 pm The 12th woman has come forward to accuse Donald Trump of doing what he bragged about doing on the Billy Bush bus tape. In a story that sounds very familiar, former Miss Finland Ninni Laaksonen told the tabloid Ilta-Sanomat that Trump grabbed her butt. Share on Twitter Print This Post 
The 12th woman has come forward to accuse Donald Trump of doing what he bragged about doing on the Billy Bush bus tape. 
In a story that sounds very familiar, former Miss Finland Ninni Laaksonen told the tabloid Ilta-Sanomat that the now Republican nominee grabbed her butt just before Trump and three other beauty pageant contests went on the air for the Late Show with David Letterman in 2006. 
“Before the show we were photographed outside the building,” Laaksonen is quoted by Haaretz . “Trump stood next to me and suddenly he squeezed my butt. He really grabbed my butt. I don’t think anybody saw it but I flinched and thought, ‘What is happening?'” 
As to the veracity of these claims, it should be noted that Laaksonen didn’t seek the tabloid out. Ilta-Sanomat, the second largest paper in the country according to Wikipedia , reached out to Finnish women who had encountered Trump and that’s how they discovered her story. 
In case you’re not already grimacing, the former Miss Finland added, “Somebody told me there that Trump liked me because I looked like Melania when she was younger.” 
Trump has been caught on tape saying women expire at the age of 35. Melania Trump is now 46, so she would have been “expired” when this alleged groping incident took place in 2006. 
New York Magazine has an exhaustive list of allegations made by women against Donald Trump. 
Donald Trump is on tape bragging about grabbing women by their “p*ssy” against their will, so it’s not a stretch to hear that he did indeed do this to women who are also willing to come forward and face the wrath of the Trump machine. 
What should be alarming is that Donald Trump is the best of the best on the Republican bench. I mean, that is supposed to be how this works, right? A group of top contenders are picked for possible nomination and the best gets it. 
Republicans try to say this is just locker room talk, but if then Senator Barack Obama had had a bus tape like Trump’s, let alone 12 women accusing him of doing what he bragged about doing, he not only wouldn’t be in office right now – he wouldn’t have been a contender. Rightfully so.",1
Trump’s Campaign Backfires As Hillary Clinton Attracts Millions of New Voters,"By Jason Easley on Thu, Oct 27th, 2016 at 2:18 pm Donald Trump promised that he would bring millions of new Republicans voters into the election, but polling in swing states shows that it is Hillary Clinton who is getting new voters out to support her.   
Donald Trump promised that he would bring millions of new Republicans voters into the election, but polling in swing states shows that it is Hillary Clinton who is getting new voters out to support her. 
Within their discussion of a new Pennsylvania poll showing Clinton leading Trump by 7 points, The New York Times reported: 
Mrs. Clinton has an 18-point lead among voters who did not participate in the 2012 election, according to our estimates, which are based on a combination of the poll results and voter file data. She fares even better among white voters who didn’t vote in 2012 than she does among white voters who did. It’s a pattern that has been true across all of the Upshot/Siena surveys in Florida, North Carolina and Pennsylvania. 
There has not been an influx of new voters who might help Mr. Trump. According to our estimates, Mrs. Clinton has a 16-point lead among newly registered voters. 
The idea that Trump was bringing millions of new voters to the Republican Party was always a myth. 
Donald Trump got the most votes of any candidate in a Republican presidential primary. Trump also set the record for most votes cast against in a Republican primary. Trump is one of the few nominees in history to have a majority of his party’s primary ballots cast against him. 
Hillary Clinton is the candidate who is attracting millions of new voters, and without a doubt, some of those voters have been motivated by Donald Trump’s campaign. 
Trump was right. He has brought millions of new voters to the polls. What he neglected to tell Republicans is that they are coming for Hillary Clinton.",1

Mrs. Obama went on to call Trump’s vision of America grounded in hopelessness and despair. She said Trump calls on us to build walls and to be afraid. 
The First Lady said that voters have a choice between those who divide the country between us and them and those who encourage us to embrace our better angels. 
First Lady Obama said that the election is about who will shape our children and the country we leave for them. 
Obama devasted Trump by reminding America that the president is the most powerful role model for children in the world. 
The enthusiasm and positivity pulsed through the building. Democrats are hungry for victory. Democrats can feel it in their bones. They are so close to electing Clinton that they can taste it. 
The tone of Clinton and Obama’s speeches told the story of where the election stands. Trump is increasingly becoming an afterthought as Democrats are transitioning towards healing the damage that Trump did to the country. 
Michelle Obama called out Trump’s strategy of calling the election rigged to depress voter turnout. Obama said, “Voters decide who wins election. Period. End of story.”

4 New Polls Suggest That Republicans Are On The Cusp Of A Total Election Disaster,"According to Quinnipiac University : Four-way races which list both presidential and vice-presidential candidates, except Georgia and North Carolina, where Green Party candidate Jill Stein is not on the ballot, show: 
Georgia: Trump at 44 percent to Clinton’s 43 percent, with 8 percent for Libertarian Party candidate Gary Johnson. This compares to a 47 – 40 percent Trump lead September 22; 
Iowa: A 44 – 44 percent Clinton-Trump tie, with 4 percent for Johnson and 1 percent for Green Party candidate Jill Stein. Trump led Clinton 44 – 37 percent September 22; 
North Carolina: Clinton edges Trump 47 – 43 percent, with 5 percent for Johnson. On October 3, Clinton had 46 percent to Trump’s 43 percent; 
Virginia: Clinton tops Trump 50 – 38 percent, with 4 percent for Johnson and 2 percent for Stein. Clinton was up 45 – 39 percent September 22. 
Contrary to some Republican hopes, Donald Trump’s slide has not stopped. Trump continues to lose support with men in Iowa and Georgia. North Carolina appears to be slipping away from Trump, and the Republican nominee has blown his leads in Iowa and Georgia. 
The Trump campaign has gone as far as to admit that if they lose Florida, they will lose the election, but the signs are evident in the polling that the Republican Party is much closer to experiencing a landslide than they are to winning the White House in November. 
A Trump landslide defeat could trigger a disaster for Republicans that leads to additional Democratic Senate pickups beyond the four seats needed to take back the majority. Republicans could see their current record House majority gutted in a Clinton landslide. 
The election is not getting better for Republicans. The landscape is getting worse. If this polling continues for another week at the state level, Democrats could be looking at their best case scenario of a Democratic White House, House and Senate being in play.",1
Democrats Are Going Back Into Florida With Millions Of Dollars To Retire Marco Rubio,"By Jason Easley   5:35 pm A Democratic super PAC is injecting millions of dollars into the Florida Senate race in a bid to retire Sen. Marco Rubio.   
A Democratic super PAC is injecting millions of dollars into the Florida Senate race in a bid to retire Sen. Marco Rubio. 
CNN reported that Harry Reid’s super PAC, the Senate Majority PAC, is injecting millions of dollars into the Florida Senate race to help Rep. Patrick Murphy in his bid to defeat Marco Rubio: “This race is closing,” spokesman Shripal Shah told CNN. “Voters know that Marco Rubio is only looking out for himself and they’re going to hold him accountable for pushing a self-serving agenda at their expense.” 
“This afternoon Senate Majority PAC made a seven-figure transfer to Floridians for a Strong Middle Class, a Florida based Super PAC supporting Patrick Murphy’s campaign. The move comes hours after Senate Majority PAC announced a record fundraising haul — $19.3 million — covering the pre-general reporting period (October 1st thru 19th) that will be filed with the FEC today.” 
Democrats have been divided over the strategy for handling the Florida race. Sen. Chuck Schumer canceled future spending in Florida to direct resources into Senate races in North Carolina, Indiana, and Missouri. Reid sees an opportunity to knock out Rubio and eliminate him from presidential contention in 2020. 
The retiring Senate Democratic leader has been loudly urging Democrats to spend big in Florida to end Rubio’s national political career. 
According to Harry Enten at FiveThirtyEight , the polling suggests that pulling out of Florida is probably the right move for Democrats, but with cash to burn and a shot to beat Rubio, there is a case to be made for more spending. 
Democrats on the ground wanted in Florida wanted more spending on the Senate race, and they’ve gotten their wish thanks to Sen. Harry Reid.",1

It was a standard day in the life of Donald Trump’s presidential campaign, as the Republican nominee spent much of his time on the campaign trail Thursday making outrageous and insulting comments. 
This was on clear display at a rally in Toledo, Ohio, when Trump proposed one of his most ridiculous ideas yet: Cancel the election and just anoint him president.

“I’m just thinking to myself right now, we should just cancel the election and just give it to Trump, right?” Trump asked the crowd. “What are we even having it for? … Her policies are so bad.” 
Despite Trump’s plea to cancel the election as he continues to struggle in the polls, it will be the voters who decide which candidate has the better policies – thankfully. 
The remark also aligns closely with other recent comments in which Trump claimed the process is rigged against him, and he will only accept the outcome of the election if it’s favorable for him. 
But Trump wasn’t done at his Buckeye State rally. He also made sure to take a dig at minority communities.

We’re gonna work with the African-American community and we’re going to solve the problem of the inner city … You can’t walk out the street. You buy a loaf of bread and you end up getting shot. 
The Republican nominee’s “ghetto” comment is the newest addition to what is the standard Trump narrative that black communities are hellscapes. This particular set of remarks comes a day after he visited North Carolina for a rally and told supporters – mostly white – that he would enact “a new deal for black America.” 
In the closing days of this election, Donald Trump is once again showing that there is no better version of who he is. The man who built a campaign on racial resentment is doubling down on it as this election season comes to a conclusion.",1

Sen. Sanders was correct. Elections are supposed to be contests about ideas and visions for the future. However, the Republican Party ran out of ideas decades ago and has been on a slow and steady descent into substituting beliefs for facts, and hopes for visions. 
Trump is trying to suppress the vote because voter suppression is the only tactic that he has left that may lead him to victory. 
It takes guts and courage to run a presidential campaign based on ideas and principles. Donald Trump lacking in both the guts and courage departments which is why he is spending the final days of his presidential campaign trying to con and scheme his way into the Oval Office. 
The media will never say it, but real candidates for office don’t try to win by discouraging people from voting. The best candidates get people excited to vote and play their vital role in the democratic process.

Kimberly Ross wrote at Red State earlier this month that, 
I don’t believe that I, as an American woman, am oppressed. However, it is beyond disappointing that men who not only claim faith, but are in leadership roles, are so willing to dismiss a predator among them. Maybe Trump has promised them some future role? I don’t know. Regardless, they are lured away from doing their duty and instead join in with someone whose hobby is casting females aside. I’m disgusted by Trump and his male cheerleaders. You should be, too. Thankfully, women like Beth Moore and Rev. Lisa Sharon Harper won’t stay quiet on the sidelines as some Evangelical men have always wished they would. 
She is hardly alone, and more and more Evangelical women are joining the ranks of those who have heard enough misogyny from Trump. The reaction of Evangelical women, as Laurie Goodstein noted at The New York Times earlier this month, be a rift “that shapes politics for years.” 
It isn’t as if Trump hasn’t been saying these things all along. As David French protested at the National Review back in June, Trump “subverts all of our most cherished values.” The question is, what took them so long? 
Trump has already had an effect on the Religious Right, an unrepentant sinner who represents everything they claim to oppose. He has 70 percent support from Evangelical men, but while Evangelical women seem to support him despite his misogyny, there are good reasons to suspect the men support him because of his negative attitude towards women. 
If Trump wants to further shrink his already deflated tent by shutting out another demographic, he’s going about it the right way.",1
Retired 4 Star General Blasts Trump For Not Supporting US Troops,"A retired four-star general called out Donald Trump as unfit to be president because he has failed to support US troops. 
In a conference call with reporters, Gen. John Allen (Ret.) said: Trump’s remarks are not only uninformed…but it also directly undercuts the courage and the commitment of our troops. And I took great exception to this. However he feels personally about this operation, he should be encouraging our efforts publicly, rather than disparaging them. 
…. 
While [Trump] appears not to understand basic military activities, it’s not clear to me that he’s interested in learning them, either. Because there are a number of experts, who I think…would advise him otherwise. But he seems to be confident in his knowledge. And that knowledge, I think, reveals a lot about what he doesn’t know. 
…. 
This kind of rhetoric; this kind of disrespect for our military leadership; this absence of support for our troops who are actually in combat and support for our allies who are fighting and dying every day – it means to me that this individual is not qualified to be Commander-in-Chief. 
Military experts, like Gen. Allen, feel compelled to criticize the Republican nominee days before a presidential election because they feel like he is not supporting the troops and would be a danger to national security as commander in chief. 
Thanks to Donald Trump, the Republican Party has become the party that doesn’t support the troops. 
Republicans have gone from “real America” to un-American in record time. 
If a presidential nominee doesn’t respect the men and women who risk their lives for the country, then he definitely won’t respect the needs of hard working Americans. 
With each word that comes out of his mouth, Trump continues to show America the real face of the Republican Party.",1

Once the plane came to a stop, emergency crews were quickly activated. 
“It was the craziest landing I’ve ever experienced,” Pence said, according to Fox News. 
CBS notes that LaGuardia is “closed until further notice.”

Trump’s New Defense Strategy On ‘Access Hollywood’ Tape: Blame The Microphone,"Thu, Oct 27th, 2016 at 9:02 pm It's amazing how often a microphone can be the root of a presidential candidate's troubles. Share on Twitter Print This Post 
In an interview with Bill O’Reilly on Thursday, Donald Trump was again asked about the ‘Access Hollywood’ tape in which the Republican nominee was caught bragging about sexually assaulting women. This time, though, he put up a new defense strategy, at least when it comes to this particular issue – blame the microphone. 
When asked by O’Reilly if he thinks he would be winning the election if not for the release of the video, Trump once again repeated that it was only “locker room talk,” and then started complaining that a microphone shouldn’t have been allowed to capture his comments. 
Shockingly, he did not express any regrets for his language.

“It was locker room talk. The microphone was not supposed to be on … it was an illegal act that was NBC. It was not supposed to be on… that was a private dressing room.” 
It’s amazing how often a microphone can be the root of a presidential candidate’s troubles. 
It should also be noted that Trump’s complaint about his dressing room privacy being breached is particularly rich given his history of storming into the dressing rooms of teenage pageant contestants, some as young as 15 years old. 
When asked by O’Reilly if he would take legal action against NBC’s role in uncovering and releasing the tape, Trump said, “You’ll see.” 
All of this comes after Trump recently promised to sue the growing number of women who have come forward saying that they were sexually assaulted by him. 
Trump also spent an absurd amount of time in the interview complaining that the media is rigged (not true), voter fraud is widespread (false), and the polls are dirty (they’re not). 
Even in the right-wing safe haven that is Fox News, Donald Trump still managed to prove himself as dangerously unfit to be president.",1
Trump Is Ahead In Zero National Polls While The Media Continues ‘Close Race’ Narrative,"Gravis: Clinton +1 LA Times: Tied 
Overall, the Democratic nominee is beating Trump by an average of 5.4 points with just 12 days to go – and as millions of Americans have already cast their ballots. 
On the Electoral College front, RealClearPolitics shows that Clinton is ahead in states that total 333 electoral votes. One of the states she leads in is Arizona – a red state before Republicans nominated Trump. 
To put things in perspective, Barack Obama was leading Mitt Romney by just a single percentage point on this day in 2012. That is what you call a close presidential contest, and Obama still went on to easily win. 
Yet, as I write, CNN and other cable news networks continue to plaster the “close race” chyron all over their networks, claiming Donald Trump is making it a race again. 
Here’s the thing: the contest between Clinton and Trump may be naturally tightening in a few polls, but that doesn’t mean it’s becoming a close race. It’s clear that, despite any one poll showing Trump gaining ground, Clinton still has a pretty durable lead. | @FiveThirtyEight tackles question everyone is asking: Is the Presidential race tightening?

While the media looks silly for trying to make the Clinton-Trump race seem like a nail-biter for the ages, there is also some good that can come of it – besides high TV ratings. 
Clinton supporters who may have previously assumed the race was in the bag for their candidate and were becoming complacent now may recognize, at least if they watch cable news, that the “race is becoming close again.” 
This should provide a last-minute boost of energy among voters who fear a Trump presidency.",1
"In the First 19 Days of October, Trump Gave Just $31K to His Own Campaign","By Hrafnkell Haraldsson on Fri, Oct 28th, 2016 at 9:19 am With the election just 10 days away, Trump has only donated just $56m of the $100m he promised and won't even invest in his own campaign Share on Twitter Print This Post 
You have got to wonder if the Trump campaign wishes it had spent less on hats and more on polling now, as it is revealed they had only $16M left in their war chest on October 19 compared to Clinton’s $62M. Probably not. There are always others to blame and Trump’s list of those plotting against him grows in inverse proportion to his polling numbers. 
From June 2015 through September 2016, the Trump campaign, meaning Donald Trump, spent $3.2m on hats according to FEC filings . They spent just $1.8m on polling. Unsurprisingly, they are behind on polling, leading in precisely ZERO (0) polls . You want to win an election? You need sweet hats"" -Abraham Lincoln 
Trump has spent more on hats than direct mail or polling… pic.twitter.com/4TOf5DQ1MQ 
— Jack Minor Jr. (@jackminorjr) October 26, 2016 
And now Clinton has four times the cash. 
And The Washington Post is reporting that in the first 19 days of October, Trump only raised half as much as Clinton according to campaign finance reports. His biggest day was the $11.5 million he brought in on the day his sex assault tape was released, which tells you all you need to know about his base. 
Remember when Trump claimed he would give $100m of his own money to his campaign? Yeah, this is a guy who won’t even buy his own autographed sports memorabilia. He uses other peoples’ money for that. With the election just 10 days away, he has only donated $56m. 
Make what you will of this, but he had been giving $2m a month to his campaign. In the first 19 days of October? Just $31k in in-kind contributions. That’s right: even Trump won’t invest in his own campaign at this point. 
Trump pulled in $61m up to October 19, down from $100m in September. Meanwhile, the Clinton campaign has pulled in a cool $101m in that same period. She spent less than normal, $54m, but that leaves her a war chest of $153m going into the final stretch. 
Donald Trump says he is a great businessman, yet he has spent twice as much on collateral (including hats) as he has on paying his staff. He says he gets only the best people. And he bought a lot of his #MAGA hats. His campaign site only sells 18 different styles of hat at $20 to $30 apiece. 
And according to Huffington Post , The October 15 Federal Election Commission filing for Trump Make America Great Again Committee shows Trump spent $300k of donors money to buy his own book – presumably The Art of the Deal. He profited personally by doing this by way of royalty payments, and then turned around and resold autographed copies of the $22 book at $184 each. 
His campaign pays him to rent his own campaign headquarters, yet Trump told a crowd in Geneva, Ohio that “Hillary Clinton has never earned an honest dollar, well I think that’s really, you know…” 
Trump is probably the first presidential nominee to try to win the White House while turning a personal profit. 
Now it looks as though Trump has seen a point of diminishing returns. He not only did not self-fund his campaign as promised, he has barely spent half of what he said he would spend, down to almost nothing at all as defeat looms and the potential for profit evaporates.

Senator Mark Kirk Mocks Disabled Veteran Tammy Duckworth for Mixed-Race Heritage,"During a debate between Rep. Tammy Duckworth and Sen. Mark Kirk (R-IL) for his U.S. Senate seat in Springfield, Illinois, Kirk mocked Duckworth’s ancestry, saying in rebuttal of her comments on the true cost of war,

His remark came in response to her statement that, “My family has served this nation in uniform going back to the Revolution. I am a Daughter of the American Revolution.”

Kirk, of course, has claimed to receive military honors he did not, in fact, receive. For him to attack Duckworth is not only the height of hypocrisy but mocking her ancestry is appalling. 
The Republican position, as restated here by Kirk, is that it’s okay to come from another country as long as you’re white. Neither Kirk nor his campaign has apologized. Kirk has said Trump should quit over his misogynist comments; apparently, it’s okay to make racist comments.

The Banishment Of Trump Has Begun As The American People Are Tuning Him Out,"By Jason Easley on Fri, Oct 28th, 2016 at 10:57 am It is a cruel reality of American electoral politics that the losers of presidential campaigns get banished from national discourse, and that process has already begun for Donald Trump. Share on Twitter Print This Post 
It is a cruel reality of American electoral politics that the losers of presidential campaigns get banished from national discourse, and that process has already begun for Donald Trump. 
Despite the fact that Trump has been claiming that the presidential election is going to be rigged, stolen, or unfair, his cries are beginning to fall on deaf ears. The latest Washington Post tracking poll found that confidence that votes will be counted correctly grew by 12 points from 31%-43%. The number of respondents who believed that voter fraud occurs somewhat often has dropped from 47%-37%, and those expressing concerns that all votes will be counted accurately dropped from 34% to 28%. Even Trump supporters are split 50%-49% on whether or not votes will be counted accurately. 
Part of the shift is likely due to the effective job that President Obama did in addressing these concerns, but it is most likely that voters are treating Trump like the candidate who is going to lose the election. 
One of the best indicators of a presidential election’s outcome as election day draws near is the question of who voters think will win. 
Hillary Clinton is dominant on the question of who voters believe will win the election, which is a hint of the way that people are voting. 
The process of tuning out the losing candidate has a long history in the US two party system. Losing candidates who refuse to go away, like Sarah Palin, are viewed as annoying relics who refuse to acknowledge that their time is up. 
Trump’s fifteen minutes of fame on the national stage appear to be coming to an end. His words can still poison and damage our country at a cultural level, which is why he still needs to be discussed, but as far as changing minds and winning an election, it looks voters are in the process of banishing Trump from the political island.",1
“Billionaire” Donald Trump’s Presidential Campaign Is Flat Out Broke,"The Washington Post reported : 
Donald Trump raised just $29 million for his presidential campaign committee in the first 19 days of October, about half as much as his Democratic rival, putting him at a severe financial disadvantage in the crucial final days of the White House contest, new campaign finance reports filed Thursday night showed. 
The GOP presidential nominee had just $16 million left in his campaign coffers on Oct. 19, compared to Hillary Clinton’s $62 million. When the cash reserves of their joint fundraising committees are included, Clinton’s war chest grew to $153 million, while Trump’s totaled $68 million. 
Trump’s total fundraising dropped 39% in the first 19 days of October. $29 million is close to nothing for a national presidential campaign in the closing weeks of the race. At a time when Trump needs boots on the ground to get out the Republican vote, his presidential campaign is broke, and in debt to the tune of $2 million. There isn’t going to be a last-minute ad blitz for Trump, or a reservation of television time so that the Republican nominee can speak directly to voters before election day. 
The plan for Trump is for the campaign to continue to limp along with lots of rallies, which are good for Trump’s ego, but not effective in getting voters to the polls. Trump promised to donate $100 million to his campaign but has only given $56 million . The billionaire who promised to self-finance has run his presidential campaign into the ground. Trump took ten times more money out of his campaign in reimbursements to his own businesses than he gave in October. 
Fundraising is an indicator of expected election outcomes. The money tends to go towards the winner at the end of an election. Hillary Clinton is having no trouble raising money, which suggests that enthusiasm is high among her supporters. Trump’s cash crush points to a depressed base that doesn’t expect him to win. 
Trump has done what he does best. He talked a big game while bankrupting the Republican Party for his own personal gain. Convincing Republicans to give him their nomination may go down in history as Trump’s biggest con of all.",1
Moronic Trump Campaign Thinks Reopened Clinton Email Investigation Will Save Them,"The Trump campaign is so desperate that they are openly celebrating the reopening of the FBI’s investigation into Hillary Clinton’s emails. 
Trump campaign manager Kellyanne Conway tweeted: A great day in our campaign just got even better. FBI reviewing new emails in Clinton probe @CNNPolitics https://t.co/WBltG2lAK6 
— Kellyanne Conway (@KellyannePolls) October 28, 2016 
The problem with the idea that the emails will save Donald Trump and the Republican Party is that Clinton was beating Trump while the FBI did their first investigation into her emails. Clinton has led Trump all through the Congressional hearings into her emails. She led Trump throughout the FBI investigation into her emails. Clinton won the Democratic nomination with her emails being a story. 
The point is that Hillary Clinton’s emails aren’t a big issue to the majority of voters. The people who aren’t Republicans in this election don’t care about her emails. 
When compared to Trump sexually assaulting women, not paying federal income taxes, and being sued in two states for fraud, the emails seem like a quaint political scandal from a much simpler time. 
There has also never been a shred of proof that Hillary Clinton did anything wrong. 
Republicans can’t get past the basic hurdle of needing actual evidence to back up their email conspiracy. 
Hillary Clinton is facing Donald Trump in this election, and only a moron or a truly desperate campaign manager clinging on the last bit of hope that she can find would believe that the reopening of an email investigation will make a bit of difference on election day. 
The voters are speaking, and they don’t care about Hillary Clinton’s emails.",1
The Reopening Of The Clinton Email Investigation Is More GOP Hype Over Nothing,"The letter from FBI Director Comey announcing the reopening of the Clinton email investigation is already being blown up into more than it is.

— Jake Tapper (@jaketapper) October 28, 2016 
As Republicans cheer because they think that they have been thrown an election lifeline, read the whole letter and look at what it says. The letter does not say that Hillary Clinton did anything wrong. The letter states that emails were found that were pertinent to the email investigation while looking into an unrelated matter. 
The letter FBI Director Comey reads like what it is, an update on an investigation. The FBI is dotting the Is and crossing the Ts. Comey’s letter destroys the Republican claim that there was a conspiracy to cover up Clinton’s emails. Republicans, including Donald Trump, have spent months criticizing Comey’s investigation, but it turns out that they were wrong. 
It would take something unprecedented and dramatic to change the FBI’s original findings. Director Comey made it clear that the agency’s work might not be completed before the election. 
The email story that Republicans and the media love, but voters have never cared about is back in the news, but it remains an empty scandal. 
The FBI’s reopened investigation does open the door for Republicans to continue their bogus witch hunt if Hillary Clinton wins the White House. Unless voters want two more years of conspiracy investigations instead of action, today’s developments have made voting for Democrats in House and Senate contests more vital than ever.",1
Hillary Clinton Is Brilliantly Forcing Broke Trump To Spend Money Defending Arizona,"By Jason Easley on Fri, Oct 28th, 2016 at 1:02 pm If Donald Trump wants to keep Arizona in the Republican column, he will have to spend some of his very limited time, money, and resources there, because Hillary Clinton is campaigning in the red state next week. Share on Twitter Print This Post 
If Donald Trump wants to keep Arizona in the Republican column, he will have to spend some of his very limited time, money, and resources there, because Hillary Clinton is campaigning in the red state next week. 
The Clinton announced that the Democratic nominee would be spending part of the last week of the campaign in Arizona, “On Wednesday, November 2, ‎ Hillary Clinton will campaign in Phoenix, Arizona, days before Election Day. Clinton will lay out what is at stake in the election. With more people voting in this election than any in history, Clinton will urge Arizona voters to take advantage of in-person early voting. Voters can check their registration status and early vote location at iwillvote.com.” 
The fact that Clinton will be in usually reliably red Arizona in November during the final week of the presidential campaign tells voters all they need to know about the state of the presidential race. 
Hillary Clinton is in such a good position that she can afford to spend some time during the last week of the campaign trying to turn red states blue. 
The Trump campaign already deployed VP nominee Mike Pence to Utah in a bid to save that dark red state from falling, and it looks like they will have to devote resources to saving Arizona to prevent Clinton from winning a state that has been a given for Republicans in previous elections. 
The Trump campaign is broke. The nominee had to give his campaign $10 million so that they could afford to buy air time in battleground states for their ads. 
The Clinton campaign is trying to stretch Trump past his breaking point by making a serious play for Arizona. It is a brilliant move from a campaign that has outwitted its Republican opponent at every turn.",1
Marco Rubio Inches Closer To Unemployment As Poll Shows Florida Senate Race Tie,"A PPP poll of Florida found: 
Candidates who have been vocal in their support for gun violence prevention perform well in Florida. Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton leads Republican Donald Trump by four points (48/44), and Democratic U.S. Senate candidate Patrick Murphy is tied with Republican incumbent Sen. Marco Rubio, 46/46. By an almost two to-one margin, 51/26, Florida voters would be more likely to vote for a candidate for U.S. Senate who supports strengthening gun laws, suggesting ample room for growth for gun safety candidates before the election next month. 
The poll was conducted by PPP the Americans for Responsible Solutions PAC, and it illustrates the dilemma that the Florida Senate race has created for Democrats. Democratic leadership is divided on spending more money on expensive Florida media, but there are polls that suggest that Sen. Marco Rubio’s Democratic challenger, Rep. Patrick Murphy, has a chance of winning the seat. 
If Rep. Murphy can beat Sen. Rubio, the defeat would likely put an end to Rubio’s national political career or at least force the Florida Republican to put the brakes on his plan to run for president in 2020, and instead focus on a run for governor. 
Democrats have a real chance to send Marco Rubio to the unemployment line. Rubio has been a disinterested Senator, who just like Ted Cruz, seems only interest in his Senate seat as a platform from which to launch his presidential ambitions. Rubio has provided poor service to his constituents , and doesn’t deserve to return to the US Senate. 
Sen. Rubio has refused to commit to serving his full Senate term, which should tell voters all they need to know about his commitment to them. 
Democrats have a chance to solidify their potential Senate majority by sending Marco Rubio home. With cash to spend and less than two weeks left in the campaign, they’d be foolish not to take it.

Mike Pence Is Fine With Trump Sexual Assault But Offended By Voter Suppression,"By Sarah Jones on Fri, Oct 28th, 2016 at 12:08 pm Donald Trump's Republican running mate Mike Pence has finally found something he's offended by, but it's not Donald Trump bragging about sexual assault or insulting African Americans or Mexicans or women or a Gold Star family. Nope. Pence is offended by a news report he hasn't read about their voter suppression efforts. Share on Twitter Print This Post 
“That’s offensive to me, that kind of language. It’s not our operation,” Indiana Governor Mike Pence said Friday morning on MSNBC’s Morning Joe . 
Yes, Donald Trump’s Republican running mate Mike Pence has finally found something he’s offended by, but it’s not Donald Trump bragging about sexual assault or insulting African Americans or Mexicans or women or a Gold Star family. 
Nope. 
Did Pence read the story? No. But he’s offended. So offended. Because that kind of language is offensive. Not the actual suppression of the votes, but the language, because it’s not “our operation.” 
Watch here via MSNBC’s Morning Joe : 
Twice saying he hasn’t read the article, Pence proceeded to launch into a diatribe about how offended he was by something he hadn’t read, “That’s offensive to me, that kind of language. It’s not our operation,” Pence denied. 
“Donald Trump and I want every American who has the opportunity to vote to vote in this election. And that’s our message, is to tell the American people that this country really belongs to them. That we can have government as good as our people again, but it’s going to take all of us.” 
“And you saw Donald Trump … say that people who haven’t traditionally voted Republican, we’ve got an agenda to bring our cities back…” 
Pence is twice offended, so super offended: 
“I’ve never heard anybody in this campaign talk that way. Frankly, you know, it was offensive to me to hear that being reported in the news because that’s just not the approach Donald Trump has taken to this campaign. It’s not the approach we’re taking. We’re reaching out to every American.” 
Pence then claimed Independents and even Democrats are breaking for Trump. In fact Trump and Pence are even losing groups that voted for Mitt Romney in 2012. Pence then belied his own confidence by trying to shame Republicans into voting for them by saying, “It’s time for Republicans to come home” because Trump won the primary. 
Mike Pence laughed at the idea that the race is over and done, because “It’s just not what I see out there.” 
Trump also loves to cite what he “sees” and reads, and often times those things turn out to not even exist – like videos he claims to have watched. 
This explains why Mike Pence and Donald Trump ended up together. It turns out, they are not that different after all, in spite of the Republican establishment’s efforts to persuade the voters and themselves otherwise. Both Pence and Trump don’t care a whit about facts. This is more than typical campaign spin, it’s appalling in context. 
The context is that Mike Pence is willingly standing next to a man who brags about grabbing a woman’s “p*ssy” without her permission, but he is publicly saying he’s offended by language used in a report about their voter suppression efforts. 
Pence didn’t even bother to read the article, which suggests that he doesn’t care if their campaign is really suppressing voters. But why would he? 
Pence didn’t care about any of the groups Donald Trump insulted – not enough to take a public stand, so why start now. But he took a public stand was when the insult was aimed at his own campaign. 
Like Trump, Pence is also insulted by language calling out bad behavior instead of the bad behavior.

Reality Slaps Donald Trump In The Face As U.S. Economy “Roars Back”,"By Sarah Jones on Fri, Oct 28th, 2016 at 2:27 pm Donald Trump's message that everything in the U.S. is crap and we are all drowning in economic hardship that only Trump can fix got slapped down today as the U.S. economy “roars back”. Share on Twitter Print This Post 
Donald Trump’s message that everything in the U.S. is crap and we are all drowning in economic hardship that only Trump can fix got slapped down today as the U.S. economy “roars back”. 
The advance estimate of GDP for the third quarter of 2016 showed that the Obama economy grew at an annual rate of 2.9%. The conservative Wall Street Journal headlined this news with, “U.S. Economy Roars Back, Grew 2.9% in Third Quarter.” 
Jason Furman, Chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers, summarized the numbers, “Real GDP grew 2.9 percent at an annual rate in the third quarter, with strong export growth and continued strength in consumer spending.” 
This news flies in the face of Donald Trump’s basic economic message of doom and gloom that only he can fix. “The Trump economic plan creates at least 25 million jobs, boosts growth up to 4 percent, and is revenue neutral,” Trump’s website claims. 
Before these numbers, Trump’s previous problem was that Trump’s economic plan is a big giveaway to the top one percent, isn’t revenue neutral and would destroy 11 million jobs. Trump also struggled with analysis that his plan could hurt the economy in the long run. 
The conservative-leaning Tax Foundation found that Trump’s plan would cost the US trillions of dollars and grow the incomes of the top one percent by 10%-16%. Trump’s tax plan could cost the U.S. 11 million jobs. 
According to a report released at the end of July by Moody’s Analytics, Hillary Clinton’s economic proposals would create millions of jobs and boost economic growth higher than current projections. “The analysis shows that, if implemented, the Democratic nominee’s agenda would create 10.4 million jobs and accelerate economic growth to an annual average of 2.7 percent.” 
Under Trump’s plan, Moody’s estimated that unemployment would spike to 7 percent and over 3 million Americans would be put out of work. “The U.S. economy will weaken significantly if Mr. Trump’s economic policies are fully implemented as he has proposed,” the June report said. “The economy will suffer a recession that begins in early 2018 and extends into 2020…even longer than the Great Recession.” 
Yikes. 
Trump sells these plans with a broadly negative message that often strays from facts. Trump earned a “Pants on Fire!” from PolitiFact for this claim made June 16th, 2015 in his presidential announcement speech, “The last quarter, it was just announced, our gross domestic product … was below zero. Who ever heard of this? It’s never below zero.” 
But also they note, “Finally, since Trump was attacking Obama for this bad quarter of growth, we’ll just throw this out: Of the 42 quarters of negative growth since World War II, 30 occurred under Republican presidents and just 12 under Democratic presidents.” 
Today’s new economic numbers help Clinton make the argument that people should vote for her if they want to continue the record setting job growth numbers and economic growth under President Obama. 
Hillary for America Senior Policy Advisor Jacob Leibenluft pounced on the numbers to say, “Today’s GDP release shows economic growth at its fastest pace in two years… But Hillary Clinton believes there is still more we need to do to build an economy that works for everyone, not just those at the top. Independent experts agree her plan would create good-paying jobs through investments in infrastructure, innovation and education.” 
The economy is roaring back under President Obama, and the numbers suggest that it does better under a Democratic president. Donald Trump keeps saying Clinton is 4 more years of Obama, which makes a sunny case for her. 
Trump is already struggling with just 11 days to go until the election on November 8th, and these numbers just added more weight to his uphill battle. Reality has spoken, and it doesn’t agree with Donald Trump’s vision of America.",1

I think they’re going to right the ship, and they’re going to save their great reputation by doing so.” The speculation is that the FBI is likely to review the new emails and stick by their original finding that Hillary Clinton did nothing wrong. 
Trump and the Republicans are jumping to some conclusions. They know that Clinton is guilty without any evidence to support their beliefs. They are assuming that the FBI is going to find evidence that Hillary Clinton did something wrong, and they think that the emails are their ticket to getting Trump elected. 
Trump has no political skills, and no idea when to use a gentle touch and stop. The Republican nominee destroyed any hope that the GOP had of using the reopened email investigation to their advantage by letting his habits of lying and changing positions on a whim take hold.

The AP is reporting: BREAKING: US official: Newly discovered emails related to Clinton investigation did not come from her private server. 
From previous reporting, it is known that the emails have nothing to do with Clinton, her campaign, the Clinton Foundation, the Russian hacks, the State Department, and any emails she sent or received. Now, we know that the emails were not on her server. FBI Director Comey completely bungled this announcement, and he needs to explain what the FBI is analyzing, because it doesn’t sound like it has anything to do with Hillary Clinton. 
The email scandal that Republicans thought would save them has evaporated nearly as quickly as it arrived. With each new development, it is clear that there is much less to the story than initially reported. 
If the Republican Party wants to risk losing, even more House and Senate seats in 11 days by pursuing this non-story, they should feel free to have at it. 
Any time that Republicans spend talking about Clinton’s emails over the next 11 days will only help the Democratic Party.",1
Donald Trump Calls A Black Supporter A Paid Thug and Kicks Him Out of His Rally,"By Sarah Jones on Fri, Oct 28th, 2016 at 8:34 pm “We have a protester! By the way, were you paid $15,000 to be a thug?” Republican nominee Donald Trump yelled at a black man as he kicked him out. The man is was a supporter of Trump's. Share on Twitter Print This Post 
“We have a protester! By the way, were you paid $15,000 to be a thug?” Republican nominee Donald Trump yelled at a black man from his lectern during a rally Wednesday evening in Kinston, North Carolina. 
Trump went on suggesting that the man had been paid by Hillary Clinton to protest Trump. But it turns out, as usual, Trump’s paranoia got the best of him and he kicked out his own supporter, a man named C.J. Cary who happened to be wearing a GOP badge and holding a letter supporting Trump but urging him to stop being so offensive. 
Watch here via Raleigh’s News & Observer: 
The News and Observer reported, “Cary says he wanted to deliver a note to Trump urging him to be less offensive and more inclusive to four demographic groups: black people, women, people with disabilities and college students. Cary, an African-American, says he’s an ex-Marine who also worked in Afghanistan as a civilian for the U.S. Army.” 
The irony is no doubt lost on the Trump crowd that this man came to urge Trump to be more inclusive of African Americans and he got called a paid thug and kicked out. So the answer to his plea seems to be, “Never gonna happen.” 
Cary was wearing a GOP badge and his letter slammed Hillary Clinton and President Obama. 
Leave it to Donald to shrink his own tent even more. It wasn’t enough that he tossed out a baby, now he’s going after his few minority supporters. 
Some things never change.",1
Hillary Clinton Laughs When Asked If the New Emails Could Sink Her Campaign,"By Sarah Jones on Fri, Oct 28th, 2016 at 8:02 pm Secretary Clinton put pressure on Comey to explain himself saying, ""We've heard these rumors, we don't know what to believe.

“The American people deserve to get the full and complete facts immediately. The director himself has said he doesn’t know if the emails referenced in his letter are significant or not,” the Democratic nominee said. 
“That’s why it’s incumbent on the FBI to tell us what they’re talking about,” Clinton said. 
Clinton pushed for more information to be released “without delay.” She said she found about the investigation from reports and that she wasn’t given advance notice. Clinton said she had not been contacted by Comey on this issue. 
When asked what she would tell voters about her emails, Clinton responded, “I think people made up their minds a while ago about the emails.” 
This might be the right place to mention the 22 million emails the Bush administration “lost” and the private RNC servers they used, as context for how important this issue really is to Republicans as a value. 
Kristen Welker asked if Clinton was afraid that this could sink her campaign, to which Secretary Clinton responded with a big laugh: ""Are you worried this could sink your campaign, Secretary Clinton,"" a reporter shouts as HRC walks out. Clinton only lets out a big laugh.

The Republican FBI Director James Comey wrote the House on Friday to inform hopeful Republicans that they had found new emails relating to Clinton’s private email that begged further investigation. 
It turns out the emails didn’t come from Clinton’s server and there doesn’t seem to be any there there, except for giving Republicans a reason their base needs to get out to vote. 
Federal employees are forbidden from participating in political activities under the Hatch Act, and this is why a complaint has already been lodged against Comey . 
Hillary Clinton laughed because what else is she supposed to do at this point. How many years on is this? Republicans have mined this hopeful scandal for so long it’s DOA. The press has followed Republicans’ lead with the absurd email story- a story as ridiculous as it is common, and a story that was never a story until Clinton did it. 
Republicans and some in the press think this might sink the Clinton campaign. So they think America would rather put Putin’s puppet who laughs about sexually assaulting women in the White House than someone whose emails we’ve all read now and found nothing much but gossip. 
Yeah, I don’t think so.

The Real Reason Why The Clinton Email Scandal Is Back Has Nothing To Do With Helping Trump,"By Jason Easley on Fri, Oct 28th, 2016 at 6:36 pm The reason why the Clinton email scandal is getting pushed 11 days before the election has nothing to with Trump's DOA White House bid, and everything to do with helping Republicans keep control of Congress. Share on Twitter Print This Post 
The reason why the Clinton email scandal is getting pushed 11 days before the election has nothing to with Trump’s DOA White House bid, and everything to do with helping Republicans keep control of Congress. 
On the surface, the sudden revival of Hillary Clinton’s emails looks like an October surprise designed to help Republican nominee Donald Trump. The problem with this theory is that both Democrats and Republicans acknowledge that Trump is toast. 
Unless Hillary Clinton’s emails say, “LOL. I was the shooter on the grassy knoll,” there is nothing that would stop her from winning the election. In fact, the emails FBI Director was investigating did not come from Clinton or her server. They seem to have very little to do with Hillary Clinton or her presidential campaign. 
The emails are like catnip to Republican voters, who have been promised for years that if they keep sending Republicans to Congress, they’ll bring down a Democratic president, and that is the real reason behind the email scandal revival. 
For the next ten days, Republican Congressional candidates are going to be able to campaign on investigating Hillary Clinton. The Republican candidates can pretend like Trump doesn’t exist because their new pitch to voters is, “Vote for me and I’ll bring down Hillary.” 
Donald Trump is a lost cause. Millions of ballots have already been cast in swing states. Trump is being out organized and trounced by Clinton on the ground. 
To understand the real value of the email scandal to the Republican Party, look down the ballot. 
The Hillary Clinton email scandal is nothing more Republican get out the vote operation to save their majorities in Congress.",1
DOJ Complaint Filed Against FBI Director James Comey For Interfering In Presidential Election,"A complaint has been filed against FBI Director James Comey with Department of Justice Office of Professional Responsibility that accuses him of interfering in a presidential election. 
The Democratic Coalition Against Trump released a statement announcing their complaint: The Democratic Coalition Against Trump filed a complaint with the Department of Justice Office of Professional Responsibility on Friday against FBI Director James Comey for interfering in the Presidential election, following the FBI’s decision to open up an investigation into Secretary Clinton’s emails this close to Election Day. Federal employees are forbidden from participating in political activities under the Hatch Act. 
“It is absolutely absurd that FBI Director Comey would support Donald Trump like this with only 11 days to go before the election,” said Scott Dworkin, Senior Advisor to the Democratic Coalition Against Trump. “It is an obvious attack from a lifelong Republican who used to serve in the Bush White House, just to undermine her campaign. Comey needs to focus on stopping terrorists and protecting America, not investigating our soon to be President-Elect Hillary Clinton.” 
Outrage is growing over Comey’s actions as details about the FBI investigation have revealed that it has nothing to do with Clinton, her emails, or her server. 
Director Comey’s motives for sending the letter 11 days before a presidential election have been questioned by both Republicans and Democrats. 
If Comey’s actions were politically motivated, he would be in violation of the Hatch Act. 
What Republicans initially viewed as a new hope in the presidential election has quickly been exposed as a desperately political ploy. 
The American people deserve a full explanation from Director Comey, because the letter that was released today raises more questions than answers.",1

So Donald Trump’s warnings about almost non-existent voter fraud were right after all. 
The only problem is that it was a Donald Trump supporter who committed voter fraud by voting twice. 
Terri Lynn Rote, 55, was booked into jail Thursday on a felony charge of first-degree election misconduct after being arrested for suspicion of voting twice, according to the Des Moines Register . 
Authorities say the registered Republican cast two electoral ballots in Polk County. She was held in jail on a $5,000 bond and released Friday.

This does make it pretty awkward for Republicans, especially Trump supporters who’ve been told to “monitor” areas where liberals and Democrats vote, which is actually called voter intimidation and is also against the law. 
In fact, Donald Trump’s unfounded claims that the election is rigged got the Republican Party sued for voter intimidation. And now one of Trump’s own supporters is arrested over voter fraud.

FBI Director James Comey Schooled by Former DOJ Spokesman for Abusing His Power,"By Sarah Jones on Fri, Oct 28th, 2016 at 11:05 pm Matthew Miller, self described ""Recovering flack from DOJ, DSCC"", schooled Republican FBI Director James Comey for violating his power and lambasted him for commenting on a case within 60 days of an election. Share on Twitter Print This Post 
Former DOJ spokesman for Eric Holder Matthew Miller, a self described “recovering flack from DOJ, DSCC”, schooled Republican FBI Director James Comey for violating his power and lambasted him for commenting on a case within 60 days of an election. 
“The department and the FBI have very strict rules about when they can comment on ongoing cases and Director Comey has violated those rules going back to his original press conference when he closed the case,” Miller said on CNN. “But this latest example violates a long standing practice which is that the department goes out of its way not to do anything that can be seen as trying to influence an election in the closing days of an election, and usually they interpret the closing days to be seen as the last 60 days let alone the last 11 days.” 
Watch here: 
Miller also held school on Twitter about Comey’s abuse of power, which has led to Hillary Clinton having to defend against a negative: I wrote a piece in July on why Comey's public comments about Clinton were such an inappropriate abuse of power. 1/ https://t.co/G8croz4qWZ

The problem with Comey’s actions isn’t that he is investigating Hillary Clinton; the problem is he is violating long standing rules that prohibit federal employees from doing anything that could be seen as political near an election. It is an established rule that ongoing investigations aren’t commented on for obvious reasons. 
This is quite simply not done. Comey’s reasons for doing this are unclear, and perhaps when he provides more information his decision will make more sense. But it’s troubling that we are seeing such a consistent breakdown of tradition and rules/agreements of law surrounding the Trump campaign, which seems to have lowered the bar all around.

Friday Fox Follies – Megyn & Murdoch’s Money,"By Headly Westerfield on Fri, Oct 28th, 2016 at 10:20 pm As Megyn Kelly garners headlines for her feminism or lack thereof, Rupert Murdoch seems desperate to keep her. Share on Twitter Print This Post 
Earlier this week Friday Fox Follies , under the assumption the explosive , and bizarre battle between Megyn Kelly and Newt Gingrich, would be this week’s lede , I had already tricked up an opening paragraph. In case you missed it , that’s when he got personal , accused her of being obsessed by sex and she told him that he should work on his anger issues . This week’s column would have been about how the Fox audience continues to splinter as they take sides in the presidential election. The NYT calls ’em Megyn Moments ; I call them fissures in what had been assumed to be the bedrock foundation of the Fox “News” Channel: it’s unthinking audience. 
Then came word that Rupert Murdoch was playing hardball as Kelly’s contract negotiations break out into the open. That paragraph, lovingly crafted, went out the window. But, let’s see what this fight was about because heat is always better than light for ratings, as Trump Congratulates Newt Gingrich For Getting His Butt Kicked By Megyn Kelly . Watch: 
As Kelly garners headlines for her feminism or lack thereof , Rupert Murdoch seems desperate to keep her. Her contract expires next year and Rupie opened up to the Wall Street Journal — of which he is owner — to partially cajole Kelly and partially to threaten her into extending her contract. Million in Contract Talks With Fox News 
“If they are going to make a network that is going to be a post-Ailes/post-Trump, it will be around Megyn Kelly, Chris Wallace and Shep Smith, and they are going to have to throw Hannity and O’Reilly overboard,” said Andrew Tyndall, a television-news consultant, of other hosts at the network. That isn’t going to happen, promised Mr. Murdoch. “We’re not changing direction…that would be business suicide,” he said. Mr. O’Reilly’s contract is also up at the end of next year, and Mr. Murdoch said, “we’re going to want Bill to stay with us.” Mr. Hannity’s contract isn’t up until 2020. Ms. Kelly has forged close ties to Mr. Murdoch’s sons, particularly Lachlan Murdoch, who is co-executive chairman of Fox and has taken an active role in contract talks, people close to the situation said. 
Fox would like to settle this before the election and before Kelly’s book is released, both of which could only strengthen her position in the negotiations if all goes well. 
From the The Power of Megyn Kelly’s Feminism—Even if She Doesn’t Call It That , by The Daily Beast’s Tim Teeman : 
Imagine, then, her mix of satisfaction and maybe ennui as she scrolled across some of the praise-ridden screeds out today: “How Megyn Kelly Became an Improbable Feminist Icon” (Vanity Fair); “Megyn Kelly Has Become The Biggest Example of White Feminism At Work (Pajiba); and “Aw Crap—Here’s Proof That Megyn Kelly Is Kind of a Feminist Role Model Now” (The Stir). Note the grudging headlines. Because of Kelly’s employer, and because she has not fought the good feminist fight in a conventional, left-wing context throughout her career to date, the F-word mantle is being conferred upon her with something of a scowl. This, in itself, reveals a kind of blinkeredness on the part of Kelly’s critics: It is perfectly possible to work for a right-facing institution and not be 100 percent right wing yourself, or spout the prevailing dogma of the TV station you work for. (Full disclosure: I worked for The Times of London, a British, Rupert Murdoch-owned newspaper, for over 13 years.) 
Aside from the fact that when she tilts Right, she tends to tilt alt-right, the biggest knock on Kelly is that she’s too hard-edged. Marshall McLuhan spoke of the Medium Cool of tee vee, but Kelly comes across as the opposite of warm and fuzzy . This makes her less attractive to other networks. She’s hoping to change that impression when she co-hosts Live with Kelly Ripa (The Kelly & Kelly Show?) the morning after the election . Think of her as a designated hitter, trying to knock Murdoch’s hardball right out of the park. 
STILL WATTERS STILL: A few weeks back FFF reported on a racist Watters World in which the White Privileged Pencil-Necked Geek made fun of Asians. This week Asian American groups meet with Fox News personnel over awful Jesse Watters segment : 
Paul Cheung, president of AAJA, told the Erik Wemple Blog that the meeting was “productive.” “I think they heard what the community’s reactions are,” he said of the session at New York’s Museum of Chinese in America. Approximately 130 Asian American “groups and allies” have signed an open letter to Fox News regarding the unfortunate episode, said Cheung. Ron Kim, a New York state assemblyman in attendance, told this blog that a representative from “The O’Reilly Factor” and a senior representative from the news side of the channel attended the meeting. Together they played a “good cop, bad cop” routine, said Kim. “The gentleman from O’Reilly’s show was defending what they were doing and trying to explain that this is a part of the opinion section of Fox News and sometimes edgy humor can go too far,” said Kim. Once again, the specter of Fox News’s vaunted news-opinion divide presents itself. As we’ve noted before, this is a convention borrowed from the newspaper industry to justify Fox News hosts such as Sean Hannity openly campaigning for Donald Trump, Steve Doocy of the morning show “Fox & Friends” spreading harmful innuendo into the public square … and O’Reilly allowing his protege to spread racist stereotypes all about Chinatown.",1
Fox News Calls for Special Prosecutor to Investigate Hillary Clinton,"By Hrafnkell Haraldsson on Sat, Oct 29th, 2016 at 7:56 am ""If she gets elected on November 8th, this isn't going away. So what needs to happen, special prosecutor? She can't investigate herself as the president-elect""   
President Barack Obama did not have to do anything wrong for Republicans to want to throw him in jail, or to impeach him. Hillary Clinton doesn’t have to have done anything wrong either, apparently, for Congress to appoint a special prosecutor to take her down once elected – because a bunch of emails had nothing to do with her . 
At least, that and completely ignoring the facts, was the theme on Fox News last night, though to be fair, other mainstream media outlets weren’t much better yesterday. 
Megyn Kelly, fresh from a stint of pretending to be a feminist in a face-off with Newt Gingrich, suggested to Chairman of the House Judiciary Committee Bob Goodlatte (R-WV) that given the FBI revelations of a complete lack of evidence that Hillary Clinton has done anything wrong, “what needs to happen” is a special prosecutor. 
MEGYN KELLY : Let me ask you this. If she gets elected on November 8th, this isn’t going away. So what needs to happen, [a] special prosecutor? She can’t investigate herself as the president-elect. BOB GOODLATTE : Well, first of all, we have said from the outset that the House Judiciary Committee would follow the truth wherever it leads, and we have done that throughout the summer, asking a number of questions about how this investigation by the FBI was being conducted. We will continue to do that. We don’t know what’s going to happen now. We don’t know what’s going to happen after the election. So it’s pure speculation what will happen afterwards. A special prosecutor, remember, is appointed by the Attorney General of the United States. So, you have to decide whether that’s going to be a fairer investigation than the one being conducted by the FBI under the direction of Director Comey right now. And the Judiciary Committee will certainly stay engaged in this and continue our investigation. 
Democracy is a fragile thing. It is to Goodlatte’s credit that he declined the call to draw up articles of impeachment in 2014 and that he cautioned Megyn Kelly that a special prosecutor is appointed not by the House but by the Attorney General. However, the GOP-led House has been far too engaged already in undermining our democracy. 
What holds this country together is an idea and an agreement among all parties that it works. Republicans have decided it only works if they’re in charge, and this has brought us to the point where we threaten to jail our adversaries, appoint special prosecutors if they win, or vote to impeach them outright, as Trump’s pet snake at CNN, Jeffrey Lord, called for last night : 
Two points, Anderson. One, with 11 days left, this makes Donald Trump’s argument exactly to the point here, you sum up the argument in terms of her judgment, her paranoia and all of the rest. The second thing, Anderson is, and this is the really disturbing thing, let’s just say for the sake of the argument she wins the election, this isn’t going to stop. There will be a move to impeach her the moment her hand comes down from that Bible. This is going to go on and on and on and on and frankly, I mean that’s something the American people need to consider now. 
It is not difficult to see where this will lead. Hillary Clinton has committed no crimes. Far from being a miscarriage of justice, though it is that as well, this is a miscarriage of reason and sanity. 
This sort of talk is just further evidence that Donald Trump comes from the same vile brew as Paul Ryan and Mitch McConnell and the rest of the party. During the McCarthy era, the House took it upon itself to be both judge and jury. Last night, it was Fox News egging the House on for more of the same. 
This sort of talk is deplorable, it is reprehensible, and it is dangerous – and strikes at the very heart of our democracy.",1

The “FBI investigation!!!!” spread like wildfire last night. This is the result of the press, once again, taking Republican smoke and claiming there’s fire. 
This observation isn’t mine along. The Washington Post’s Greg Sargent pointed out that there is only an upside and no penalty for doing this — for both Republicans and the press: This is how GOP hype-ahead-of-the-facts gets rewarded by media's willful perpetuation of smoke/fire effect.

Even though early polling shows there hasn’t been an impact in swing states , and even though the majority of Americans have already made up their minds, each time her emails are brought up Hillary Clinton falls in the polls. 
A Gallup poll showed that “emails” are the most Americans have heard about Clinton. Not that she is the most qualified candidate in modern history or how her policy on paid family leave might impact them — but the emails that she was already cleared on. 
Even though one result of the Comey letter has been to energize Clinton supporters , at a time when she was facing a likely win that can create complacency, this still isn’t an acceptable practice. 
Republican FBI Director James Comey finds himself in the hot seat today after sending a letter that has no precedent, obviously would impact an election that was then just 11 days out and is now 10 days out, and actually bore no information– well, that’s inaccurate. The letter bore inaccurate smoke and innuendo that has already been cleared, but the damage has already been done. 
While Ron Fournier and others suggested that Democratic objections to this unprecedented violation of the rules by Comey was just more partisan folly, the truth is even more disturbing. 
By even suggesting that objecting to violating a longstanding rule is partisan, we are allowing the press to enable Republicans to continue pretending there is no reality. 
In reality, no matter which side of the aisle you are on, it’s a rule not to comment on ongoing investigations that could impact an election. The reasons for this are obvious and the potential ramifications for abuse are terrifying for both parties — for instance, it’s obvious that the FBI is investigating the Trump campaign for coordination with Russia, but we don’t headline that because the FBI hasn’t commented on that, because… 
To do so would violate the rule not to interfere with elections. 
So it’s really quite frightening to hear people claim objecting to violating this rule is partisan, even as the Trump campaign is benefiting from the adherence to said rule. If the rule applies to Donald Trump, it should apply to Hillary Clinton. 
Asking that this value be applied to both sides is not partisan. 
We must stick to reality. We must not allow our need to appear objective cause us to fall so far down the rabbit hole that we enable Republicans to keep drinking the no-fact Kool-Aid. 
The press did the Republican smoke is a real fire thing all through President Obama’s terms, at one point claiming he was implicated in Benghazi emails because a reporter allowed a Republican aide to read him said emails — and of course, it turned out that the emails didn’t say what the aide told the reporter. But that was learned much later and as everyone knows, a lie travels faster than the truth. 
And now American voters in swing states who read papers will think the FBI is investigating Clinton. 
So Comey’s letter did damage Hillary Clinton. Even if she wins the election, the letter damaged her and down ballot Democrats. 
The media never learns. They take Republican smoke and innuendo and treat it as fact, every time. They look like fools to those who know there was no there in the Comey letter, but the average voter doesn’t live for political updates. 
The irresponsible damage is done.

Comey Letter Backfires As Email Scandal Revival Energizes Hillary Clinton Supporters,"Share on Twitter Print This Post 
In a conference call with reporters, Hillary Clinton’s campaign manager said that FBI Director Comey’s letter is backfiring and energizing Clinton’s volunteers to work harder and her supporters are voting in even bigger numbers. 
Clinton campaign chair John Podesta called Comey’s letter long on innuendo, short on facts. Podesta said the more information that comes out, the more this seems overblown. Podesta went off on Rep. Jason Chaffetz for distorting the facts and undermining his own legitimacy by claiming that the investigation was reopened. Podesta said that Comey had provided selective information that allowed partisans to distort the facts. 
Podesta said there’s no evidence of wrongdoing, no charge of wrongdoing. He said if all the media reports are true, about the investigation having nothing to do with Hillary Clinton, it’s hard to see how this amounts to anything. 
Hillary Clinton’s campaign chair called on Comey to provide answers to be public. 
Clinton campaign manager Robbie Mook said that the Comey letter is motivating Clinton volunteers and supporters: 
Based on the anecdotes I am hearing from out team on the ground, this situation has created an urgency and intensity among our volunteers and activists that was already high because we are so close to the election. Our volunteers are rallying around Hillary They know what a fighter she is. 
…. 
They are turning out, not only to have her back but to rally our supporters to turn out and vote, as early voting goes into full swing. We’re not just seeing this in our offices, on the ground, but also in our online, in the online space as well. I think this is; we already had momentum and wind behind our back going into yesterday. I think that this has only increased the momentum that we’re feeling among our activists on the ground. 
Later Mook suggested that the Comey letter is helping the Clinton campaign by adding fuel to their early voting fire. It is likely that the Comey letter will backfire on Republicans and motivate Democrats to get out and support their nominee. 
An early report from a pollster in two swing states saw no impact from the letter on voters. Hillary Clinton may end up benefiting from Comey’s actions because the FBI Director might have gotten rid of the one thing that could have beaten her. 
With one written paragraph, James Comey may have destroyed Democratic complacency.",1

In the video, Trump publicly sexualizes and shames the 2004 Miss Universe winner from Australia, Jennifer Hawkins as revenge. Before he does it, Trump tells the audience, “Get even with people. If they screw you, screw them back 10 times as hard. I really believe that.” 
Watch this newly surfaced 2011 corporate speech here via Huffington Post (major trigger warning if you’ve been there): 
Watching this you see the Trump modus operandi in action. This is the sting felt by numerous women who report spurning Trump’s advances. The harassment as revenge. The sexual shaming. 
Trump sets the audience up for the Roman Gladiator moment of public sexual offering by priming them with his belief that you should “screw” people back if they “screw” you. The sexually angry verb foreshadows what’s to come, because he is going to “screw” Jennifer Hawkins in public, when she realizes that because it’s public, she can’t further humiliate him by saying no or objecting without facing huge repercussions. 
Trump says he’s going to give them an example of his revenge theory, “Jennifer Hawkins.” 
Trump orders Hawkins to the stage. The audience cheers and jeers, delighting in the upcoming shaming of the beautiful girl. It’s to be a public spanking. So much fun. 
“First of all, how beautiful is Jennifer,” Trump asks, claiming ownership of Jennifer as an object while playing magnanimous daddy who dishes out praise and approval before the spanking. The message: He can make or break her. She better play nice. 
Warning shot, “This is about getting even.” 
Trump tells the audience that he was mad at Hawkins because she allegedly dissed him by declining to introduce him at the event in Sydney. He tells the audience how mad he was, and then says, as she’s crossing the stage, “She’s my favorite Miss Universe.” So she thinks maybe this isn’t going to be as bad as she fears. 
But then he stabs her publicly for the first time, “But I think I like the new one better.” 
The audience loves it. He is going to feed them the sexual humiliation of a beautiful woman because she wasn’t a good girl. She reaches him and they clasp hands while she smiles through the shame knowing she has no choice and wanting to be a good sport. 
Hawkins tries to make light of the situation while appeasing Trump, playing along with his game because she has to, but there will be no easy way out of this one. It won’t be enough to fawn over him in front of the audience. She will have to pay. 
“I was actually going to get up and tell you that Jennifer is a beautiful girl on the outside, but she’s not very bright,” Trump tells the audience, signaling that Hawkins is a piece of meat to be dissected by him publicly for her refusal to give him anything he asks for. 
“That wouldn’t have been true, but I would have said it anyway,” Trump proudly tells the audience. This is his alpha male routine, except in real life, the alpha male doesn’t have to abuse money and power he inherited in order to win the girl. But in the mind of little men like Trump, this makes him a winner. 
Trump points out that Hawkins is a big star now, but he helped her make it and then dissed him. He owns her. She must comply or face his wrath. Hawkins tries to say that she did introduce him, but Trump pushes her away from the microphone. This public shaming will be done from Trump’s POV only. No need for Hawkins to assert her personhood.There will be no defense allowed, because she’s already guilty. 
“And you know what? She came tonight, she came — came, she came, she came,” Trump says gleefully like the drunk pervy uncle everyone tries to avoid at Christmas. He waits for the audience to join him in his sexual shaming, and they do. They get it. Hee heee. So clever. Came. Knuckles dragging on the floor clever. 
“See, so they have the same filthy minds in Australia,” Trump says. 
Trump grabs Hawkins around the waist and forces a kiss on her, just like he bragged about doing on the Bush tape. 
Hawkins reflexively turns away and puts her arm between them. The kiss misses its mark and lands on her cheek. She is hoping this is good enough humiliation for him, but putting her foot down on actual mouth contact. She’s allowed herself to be publicly humiliated to appease him, and pretended to fawn over him as required, but she will not, cannot, allow the kiss. The repulsive kiss. 
I’m telling this story as I imagine it to be from her point of view, although she has refused to comment. Of course she refused to comment, women are told they will be blackballed if they comment. The world is full of men like Trump, and they stick together. See Roger Ailes. Women have to play along and appease and if that doesn’t work, they have to allow themselves to be sexually assaulted and humiliated just a little bit in public, especially if they said no in private. 
I can only do this because I have lived it, somewhat like this, in public. And I have tried to appease the ego of the assaulter in order to keep my job, while denying him his assumed entitlement to my body. 
From talking to so many women during this election, I know that I’m not alone. I know that many other women will watch this and know. They will feel the creep of fear and revulsion, the deer in the headlights cringe that takes over when you know that you are about to be humiliated as a sexual object because you refused him or refused to appease the ego of the powerful man in charge by behaving like a sexual conquest. How dare Hawkins have her own life and be unwilling to change all of her plans in order to introduce Trump. 
And other people will watch this humiliation and enjoy it, setting you up to be humiliated even more. They will laugh about it and gossip about it, which is the social punishment women face when they reject a man like Trump. Ironically, if you give in you’re not humiliated. It’s only if you say no that you are set up to be publicly flogged as a sex object. 
It’s not just the unwanted kiss, although that is disgusting and assault, much like Donald Trump bragged about doing on the Billy Bush bus tape. It’s the public humiliation and denigration. 
It’s the way the woman is forced, in front of thousands of people, to try to smile her way through his ambush of verbal and physical assaults as he takes revenge. 
It’s the way she tries to make it okay, to sweet-smooth his ego in order to get out of the line of fire, and in return he shames her by suggesting he made her “come” and then grabs her for an unwanted kiss. 
If there is any good to come out of the total crapfest of the Trump candidacy, perhaps it is a raised awareness that women are people, and that this kind of thing is horrific but it’s not all Trump’s fault. It’s the culture’s fault because it takes a willing audience to successfully publicly sexually shame a woman. 
In fact, this is shades of what Trump did to Hillary Clinton in the stalking debate, after which he announced that looking at her from behind he was not impressed. 
Neither are we by you, Mr. Trump. Neither are we.",1
Pollster Sees No Early Impact From Comey Clinton FBI Email Letter In Swing States,"A pollster who is in the field in two swing states is reporting that he is seeing no early impact from the FBI reviewing new emails in the Hillary Clinton investigation in two swing states. 
Geoff Garin of Hart Research tweeted from the field: Still early, but I was in the field in two states last night and saw absolutely no impact from the reporting on the Comey letter. 
— Geoff Garin (@geoffgarin) October 29, 2016 
It is still early, but if this were the election shifting news that Republicans were hoping for the impact would have been immediate. The reality is that if the public opinion polls tighten in the final days of the campaign, it will be because Republicans are coming back to Trump. 
There are few undecided voters in this election, and even if all the Republican base come home to Trump, it won’t be enough for Trump to win, because he is losing where the presidential election is really held. Trump is getting crushed at the state level. 
Republicans have been trying to build Hillary Clinton’s emails into a story for years, and they have failed at every turn. 
Hillary Clinton led the election while under Congressional investigation. Hillary Clinton led the election while under FBI investigation. Hillary Clinton is leading the election today. The message that Republicans and the media don’t want to hear is that voters are sick of the emails, and they don’t care. 
Voters are smarter than Republicans and the press give them credit for. The Hillary Clinton email scandal has never broken out of the right wing bubble because there is no evidence that Clinton did anything wrong. 
If the polls tighten a little, this will be the best news in the world for Hillary Clinton and Democrats, because it will destroy any potential for Democratic complacency and get their voters out and to the polls. 
What Geoff Garin witnessed is probably going to end up being very accurate. James Comey’s letter to Congress is unlikely to move swing states and change the outcome of the presidential election.",1
Bombshell New Details Destroy Republican Hopes In FBI Clinton Email Investigation,"Share on Twitter Print This Post 
The FBI is examining how a Hillary Clinton aide handled emails. The examination has nothing to do with the Democratic nominee, her emails, or her email server. 
According to Newsweek’s Kurt Eichenwald, the “scandal” is related to the process Clinton aide Huma Abedin used to print out emails for the then secretary of state to read. 
Eichenwald reported: Because Clinton preferred to read documents on paper rather than on a screen, emails and other files were often printed out and provided to her either at her office or home, where they were delivered in a diplomatic pouch by a security agent. Abedin, like many State Department officials, found the government network technology to be cumbersome, and she had great trouble printing documents there, investigative records show. As a result, she sometimes transferred emails from her unclassified State Department account to either her Yahoo account or her account on Clinton’s server, and printed the emails from there. It is not clear whether she ever transferred official emails to the account she used for her husband’s campaign. 
Abedin would use this procedure for printing documents when she received emails she believed Clinton needed to see and when the Secretary forwarded emails to her for printing. Abedin told the FBI she would often print these emails without reading them. Abedin printed a large number of emails this way, in part because, investigative records show, other staff members considered her Clinton’s “gatekeeper” and often sent Abedin electronic communications they wanted the Secretary to see. 
The entire scandal is about how emails were printed. It has nothing to do with how Hillary Clinton handled emails or classified information. The investigation is related to how an aide printed emails for Hillary Clinton to read. No wonder Comey didn’t provide more details in his letter to Congress. The details of what is being examined are an embarrassment to the FBI. 
There is no evidence that Clinton’s aide committed a crime. For the printing of the emails to be deemed criminal, there must be evidence that Abedin intended to leak classified information. There remains zero evidence of criminal activity. 
The FBI examination of new emails is turning out to be one of the most overblown red herrings of the 2016 election , and Comey’s behavior is a disgrace to the US intelligence community. 
The new information destroys Republican hopes that the new emails were the game changer that could save them from defeat . Republicans may spend the remaining days pushing the emails, but their behavior will be the hallmark of a desperate party that is facing a crushing defeat. 
The emails won’t change anything in 2016, but they will give Congressional Republicans a reason to keep investigating Hillary Clinton in 2017 and beyond. In other words, James Comey is already delegitimizing Hillary Clinton’s potential presidency.",1
Trump Melts Down And Accuses The US Postal Service Of Stealing The Election For Clinton,"Trump warned his supporters that the US Postal Service is trying to steal the election for Hillary Clinton in Colorado. 
Video: 
At a rally in Golden, CO, Trump said: 
I have real problems with ballots being sent. Does that make sense? 
Like people saying, “Oh, here’s a ballot. Here’s another ballot. Throw it away. Oh, here’s one I like. We’ll keep that one.” 
I have real problems, so get your ballots in. 
Trump also accused election officials of throwing away ballots, as his rally was a mixture of claims of voter fraud and baseless speculation about Hillary Clinton’s emails. 
Donald Trump appears to be losing his mind. He also seems to think that accusing the US Postal Service and election officials of stealing the election for Hillary Clinton is going to motivate Republicans to vote. 
Consider the contradiction in Trump’s message. The Republican nominee tells his supporters that the US Postal Service is throwing away ballots, while at the same time he is urging them to mail in their ballots. 
If their ballots are going to be thrown away by USPS, why should Republicans bother mailing their ballots in? 
It is this sort of incoherent gibberish that makes no sense. Trump’s inability to stay disciplined and on message is also one of the biggest reasons why Republicans on pace to lose this election. 
Donald Trump’s descent into paranoid senior citizen continues to play out in front of the entire nation, as the Republican nominee for president believes that his letter carrier is out to get him,",1
"President Obama Gets Real, Not Revenge, On Republicans","By Rmuse on Sat, Oct 29th, 2016 at 3:23 pm He is taking the conspiracy theories and obstruction that dogged his presidency from day one and throwing them back in Republicans' faces.   *The following is an opinion column by R Muse* 
Although this campaign season has been interesting, to say the least, there is something happening one never thought would occur. After spending nearly eight years demonizing, obstructing, and criticizing every and anything about the President of the United States, Republicans desperate to save their jobs are beginning to tout their “ imagined ” close ties to the Democratic President whose approval rating and popularity are growing. 
It is hypocritical, to say the least, and at some point a result of a toxic Republican candidate for the presidency, but for some GOP candidates it is a very dangerous strategy. If any Republican believed President Obama would allow them to take advantage of him after spending eight years assailing him as illegitimate and corrupt, they were sadly mistaken and underestimated the commander in chief’s tolerance during an election. 
The President is using the final two weeks before the election to decimate Republicans for either “ belated rejection ” or continued support of Donald Trump. President Obama is also reminding Republicans that “ Donald Trump is the endpoint of eight years of [GOP] toxic hostility .” It may be a tad of an exaggeration to claim that “ Obama seems determined to spend the last two weeks of the election laying waste to every Republican who ever crossed him ,” but he is getting some well-placed and well-warranted shots at Republicans. 
Two Republican hypocrites hoping to take advantage of the President’s approval ratings have been some of his harshest critics; so it likely stunned the President that they are boasting working closely with the man they obstructed, opposed, and attempted to get rid of. 
Ohio Senator Rob Portman had the temerity to run a campaign ad boasting about working closely with the President “to break the grip of heroin addiction.” President Obama took the time to excoriate Portman for, 
“ Finally withdrawing his support from Donald Trump ,” but only “ After looking at the polling. Now that it’s politically expedient. But he has supported him up until last week? So I guess it was OK when Trump was attacking minorities, and suggesting that Mexicans were rapists … and insulting Gold Star moms, making fun of disabled Americans. I guess that didn’t quite tip it over the edge. Why was that OK? And now he says he will vote for the vice-presidential nominee instead, except that guy still supports Donald Trump. ” 
The President was a little more exercised after learning that the man who called the President “ one of the most corrupt presidents in modern times,” California Republican Representative Daryl Issa, is sending out campaign mailers with the President’s face on them and boasting about his close work with President Obama “ to protect victims of sexual assault .” 
Daryl Issa is in a fairly competitive race compared to past elections and he certainly has earned the President’s wrath after obstructing progress and wasting taxpayer money on Issa-created scandals. During a fundraiser in La Jolla California Sunday last, the President assailed Issa for having the audacity to use a campaign mailer with the President’s image on it. The President said, 
“ Issa’s primary contribution to the United States Congress has been to obstruct and to waste taxpayer dollars on trumped-up investigations that have led nowhere. This is now a guy who, because poll numbers are bad, has sent out brochures with my picture on them touting his cooperation on issues with me. Now that is the definition of chutzpah.” 
As remarked by Tim Murphy at Mother Jones, President Obama is not just evening up the score with Republicans who made his tenure miserable, “ He is attempting to have the last word on the personal and political fights of the last eight years—to take the conspiracy theories and obstruction that dogged his presidency from day one and throw them back in Republicans’ faces .” 
The President clearly has a lot of “ words ” to harangue Republicans with. He said , 
“ Here’s the thing. For years, Republican politicians and the far-right media outlets have pumped up all kinds of crazy stuff about me. About Hillary. About Harry. They said I wasn’t born here. They said climate change is a hoax. They said that I was going to take everybody’s guns away! They said that while we were doing military exercises that we’ve been doing forever, suddenly this was a plot to impose martial law. This is what they’ve been saying for years now! So people have been hearing it they start thinking well maybe it’s true! And if the world they’ve been seeing is I’m powerful enough to cause hurricanes on my own and to steal everybody’s guns in the middle of the night and impose martial law—even though I can’t talk without a ‘prompter—then is it any wonder that they end up nominating somebody like Donald Trump? 
And the fact is that there are a lot of politicians who knew better. There are a lot of senators who knew better but they went along with these stories because they figured you know what this’ll help rile up the base, it’ll give us an excuse to obstruct what we’re trying to do, we won’t be able to appoint judges, we’ll gum up the works, we’ll create gridlock, it’ll give us a political advantage. So they just stood by and said nothing and their base began to actually believe this stuff. So Donald Trump did not start this. Donald Trump didn’t start it, he just did what he always did which is slap his name on it, take credit for it, and promote it. That’s what he always does. And so now, when suddenly it’s not working and people are saying wow this guy’s kind of out of line, all of a sudden these Republican politicians who were okay with all this crazy stuff up to a point suddenly they’re all walking away. Oh, this is too much. So when you finally get him on tape bragging about actions that qualify as sexual assault and his poll numbers go down, suddenly that’s a deal-breaker. Well what took you so long! What the heck! What took you so long! All these years!” 
The Mother Jones piece made out like President Obama is seeking retribution, or “ revenge ” against Republicans for their impropriety as legislators over the past eight years. Without knowing what goes on in the President’s head to motivate his campaign rhetoric; that is a hard call to make with any surety. Barack Obama does not strike one as being vindictive. 
The President is, though, an accomplished campaigner and as his tenure in the White House is winding down and Republicans are struggling to find an identity apart from Donald Trump, it is prudent of the President to remind voters exactly what Republicans are about and what they are about is precisely why Donald Trump is their standard bearer; and why Republicans are hypocrites for both abandoning Trump and embracing the man they obstructed and tried to remove from the White House.",1
"When Trump Attacked the Khans, He Didn’t Know What a Gold Star Family Was","By Hrafnkell Haraldsson on Sat, Oct 29th, 2016 at 4:05 pm “You do know you just attacked a Gold Star family?” one adviser warned Trump. ""What's that?"" he asked. Share on Twitter Print This Post 
Gabriel Sherman writes at New York Mag that when Donald Trump attacked the Khan family over Khizr Khan’s speech at the Democratic National Convention, he had no idea what a Gold Star family was. 
You will remember that Khizr Khan stood up in front of the entire world and said to Donald Trump, “Let me ask you, ‘Have you even read the United States Consitution?’ I will gladly lend you my copy. In this document, look for the words ‘liberty’ and ‘equal protection of the law.’” 
The fallout was predictable. Donald Trump, openly criticized, lost it. He attacked the Khan’s religious beliefs, saying “If you look at his wife, she was standing there. She had nothing to say. She probably, maybe she wasn’t allowed to have anything to say.” 
Now it turns out that he had no idea what he was doing. Because he is ignorant, and because, as Mark Cuban has observed, he isn’t interested in learning anything. Gabriel Sherman explains: 
“You do know you just attacked a Gold Star family?” one adviser warned Trump. Trump didn’t know what a Gold Star family was: “What’s that?” he asked. To Trump, Khizr Khan and his wife, Ghazala, were enemies who had said something mean about him, just like Rosie O’Donnell and any number of people who had gotten under his skin over the years. Wasn’t it his right to respond? “ ‘The election is about the American people, it’s not about you,’ ” Manafort told Trump, according to a person briefed on the conversation. Trump countered with Breitbart’s report on Khan’s purported belief in Sharia. “ ‘He’s not running for president,’ ” Manafort shot back. “ ‘The Clintons did this to us to waste our time getting off message.’ ” 
Of course, Trump could not and would not admit his own ignorance and he certainly wasn’t prepared to take the blame. Instead, as Sherman reveals, he “took it out on Manafort in front of his senior advisors, including Ailes.” According to Trump, Manafort wasn’t “able to get the media to focus on the right stuff.” 
No wonder, when Trump refuses to take Manafort’s advice and focus on the right stuff. This is not to defend Manafort, who is at least as despicable as his boss, but it serves as an example of how Trump’s first reaction each and every time is to get back at his critic. 
It was one of Donald Trump’s most visible Joe McCarthy moments, and his response to Khizr Khan actually reinforced the point Khan was trying to make. 
Stopping and thinking are foreign to him. And if you are not astonished by the appalling ignorance on display here, you should not be. This is all in keeping with a party that prides itself on ignorance rather than facts.",1
Koch Brothers Helped Incite the Impending Bloodbath Among Republicans,"By Rmuse   7:57 pm ""If the party doesn’t learn lessons and change based on what’s gone on for the last year and a half, I think it’s going to be just catastroph[ic].""   *The following is an opinion column by R Muse* 
It may be the understatement of the year to say the Republican Party is on the verge of a full-on civil war, and it may be obvious to many Americans that the blame for the inter-party discord is its standard bearer Donald J. Trump. However much Trump’s candidacy has contributed to the tensions between establishment types terrified of Trump’s reckless disregard for the longevity of the party and rebellion-minded Trump supporters, the real instigators are the Koch brothers. 
Although the oil magnates were never on the Trump bandwagon, they are responsible for the Trump loyalists within the GOP who were part of the teabagger movement intent on disrupting the nation’s political system and indeed, the workings of government itself. The tea party caucus, an extremist sect that succeeded in chasing former House Speaker John A. Boehner out of Congress, morphed into the inaptly- named Freedom caucus that has embraced Trump are set to set fire to the party establishment and it isn’t solely to put current Speaker Paul Ryan out of a job, although that is high on the Trump supporters’ to-do list. 
As noted in Wednesday’s New York Times, “ Mr. Trump’s supporters said they were determined to harness the anti-establishment energy that Mr. Trump had catalyzed and to refocus it on the Republican leadership in Congress — a target many of them seem…eager to take down .” 
The right-wing extremist that actually “ took down ” former House Majority Leader Eric Cantor, conservative extremist and House Freedom Caucus member David Brat, issued a warning to establishment Republicans: 
“ There’s a huge chunk of people who want to see a fight taken to D.C. Leadership comes and smacks our guy? That’s where you’re going to put down a marker? Really? And the American people are just scratching their head saying, ‘Really? That’s rich .’” 
Brat has been a thorn in the establishment’s side since Paul Ryan became Speaker and he joins a dangerous number of “ real conservatives ” who cannot understand or comport with Ryan and establishment leaders who dared criticize Trump instead of using their majority advantage to go after Hillary Clinton. 
Donald Trump and a few of his “ senior aides ” are prodding extremist conservatives to revolt against the establishment leadership after the election for not defending Trump. In fact, besides assailing Ryan for not sticking by Trump, it is reported that Trump said privately that Ryan should be made to pay a heavy price for disloyalty to the Trump candidacy. And, during an interview with Reuters he complained that “ The people are very angry with the leadership of this party, because this is an election that we will win, 100 percent, if we had support from the top .” Win or lose, there is going to be a major blood-letting after the election and the establishment, although powerful, may face a Herculean task to save the party. 
This impending conflict within the GOP has been brewing longer than Donald Trump has been a candidate and it may be why he brought on an experienced anti-establishment devotee to run his campaign. The chairman of Breitbart News, Stephen Bannon, had made it one of his primary goals to get Paul Ryan out as House Speaker because he is not a “true conservative” intent on tearing government down to restructure it into an uber-conservative paradise. And “uber-conservative” is just a different way of saying a “ non-government ” according to the Koch brothers’ vision of American libertarianism. Don’t believe it? 
Two groups closely aligned with the Koch brothers, Heritage Action for America and FreedomWorks , have been pushing Republicans as a Party to adopt more extremist positions and see the civil war as a stellar opportunity to have greater influence over the party’s decisions; something establishment types are resisting. 
Over the past few days, leaders of both Koch groups joined extremist conservatives in calling to delay a vote on selecting a candidate to be the next, or new, speaker of the House; something typically occurring directly after the general election in November regardless the outcome. 
According to the chief executive of Heritage Action, Michael Needham, there is going to be Hell to pay for establishment Republicans if they don’t bend to the will of the extremist wing created by the Kochs and heavily courted by Donald Trump. Mr. Needham said, 
“ If the party doesn’t learn lessons and change based on what’s gone on for the last year and a half, I think it’s going to be just catastrophe .” 
Another conservative extremist, House Freedom Caucus member and ardent Donald Trump supporter echoed Needham’s sentiment and said, “ You can’t ignore what millions and millions of people have expressed in this election cycle. ” 
The dilemma for Republicans after the election, no matter the outcome, is maintaining a semblance of stability as a political party. That doesn’t seem likely because if Trump loses, big or small, the extremists will unleash whatever level of Hell they can muster on the establishment for daring to criticize any of Trump’s more outrageous and dangerous comments on the stump. If Trump wins, the extremists will be emboldened to purge the party of any disloyal establishment types and it appears that no matter what happens on November 8, it will not be the end of hostilities among Republicans. 
The Republican Party establishment is in for a reckoning with an extremist wing that was once content threatening the full faith and credit of the United States or shutting down the government as a show of anger. After four years of internal bickering over what it means to be a true conservative, and the past year-and-a-half of incitement by Donald Trump, the Republican Party faces a serious threat to its long-term survival. It is a threat that began about six years ago when the Koch brothers ushered in an age of extremist conservatives that Donald Trump took advantage of to seize control of the Republican Party.",1
Concert plus campaign: Clinton turns to celebrities in homestretch,"By Reuters   7:16 pm Heading into the homestretch of the presidential campaign, Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton is looking to harness some celebrity star power to help get out the vote and energize volunteers in battleground states.   
By Roberta Rampton 
DAYTONA BEACH, Fla. (Reuters) – Heading into the homestretch of the presidential campaign, Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton is looking to harness some celebrity star power to help get out the vote and energize volunteers in battleground states. 
Jennifer Lopez will headline a free concert for Clinton supporters in Miami on Saturday, giving the former secretary of state a chance to connect with the key demographic of millennials she has sometimes struggled to reach – and some visual counter-programming to the latest email controversy to roil her race for the White House. 
The Federal Bureau of Investigation said on Friday it is investigating more emails as part of a probe into Clinton’s use of a private email system – a late-breaking surprise that will likely continue to get extensive media play leading up to the Nov. 8 vote 
Celebrity-driven events like the concert “can serve as a bit of a distraction” from the controversy, said Eric Kasper, a political scientist at the University of Wisconsin-Eau Claire. 
“It is a way to kind of take the edge off things because it tends to be more positive,” Kasper said. 
The JLo concert is the first in a series. Next week, Clinton will take the stage with Jay Z in Cleveland, and then with Katy Perry in Philadelphia on Nov. 5. 
A Harvard University poll this week showed that among likely voters aged 18 to 29, Clinton is leading Republican rival Donald Trump, a celebrity in his own right who starred in the reality television show “The Apprentice.” 
But turnout is a concern. The exceptionally negative tone of this year’s race for the White House has soured young Americans on politics, Reuters/Ipsos polling shows. 
Presidential candidates have long sought to create buzz with help from celebrity pals, said Tevi Troy, who chronicled the strategy in his book “What Jefferson Read, Ike Watched, and Obama Tweeted: 200 Years of Pop Culture in the White House.” 
“Campaigns do it to reach out to people who are not necessarily interested in politics but are interested in pop culture,” said Troy, a presidential historian who worked in the George W. Bush White House. 
The events are like a larger version of a campaign yard sign, a way to show a “groundswell” of support behind a candidate – and a way to appeal to fans of the musicians, said Kasper, who has studied the intersection between pop culture and politics. 
“It can create a kind of psychological connection that we otherwise might not have when a politician endorses a presidential candidate, for instance,” Kasper said.

Clinton campaign urges FBI to detail new developments in email case,"By Reuters   6:34 pm Democrat Hillary Clinton's top aides on Saturday lashed out at FBI Director James Comey for igniting a new controversy over a long-running private email investigation less than two weeks before the presidential election, saying there was no evidence of wrongdoing and accusing him of spreading ""innuendo.""   
By Roberta Rampton and Steve Holland 
DAYTONA BEACH, Fla./GOLDEN, Colo. (Reuters) – Democrat Hillary Clinton’s top aides on Saturday lashed out at FBI Director James Comey for igniting a new controversy over a long-running private email investigation less than two weeks before the presidential election, saying there was no evidence of wrongdoing and accusing him of spreading “innuendo.” 
Comey, who has headed the Federal Bureau of Investigation since 2013, notified the U.S. Congress on Friday that the agency is again reviewing emails, even though in July it decided not to seek prosecution of Clinton for her handling of classified materials on a private email server while she was secretary of state. 
John Podesta, who heads Clinton’s presidential campaign, told reporters that Comey’s letter to Congress was “light on facts, heavy on innuendo,” and he urged Comey to “come forward and give those answers to the American public” about the exact nature of the FBI’s latest review of emails. 
Sources close to the investigation on Friday said the latest emails were discovered as part of a separate probe into Anthony Weiner, the estranged husband of top Clinton aide Huma Abedin. 
Weiner, a former U.S. congressman from New York, is the target of an FBI investigation into illicit text messages he is alleged to have sent to a 15-year-old girl in North Carolina. 
With the Nov. 8 elections quickly approaching, Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump pounded away at the new FBI development, devoting a large part of a campaign speech in Golden, Colorado, to attacking Clinton and arguing that she is not to be trusted with the presidency. 
“Her criminal action was willful, deliberate, intentional and purposeful,” Trump said, standing in front of hay bales stacked in a horse barn. “Hillary set up an illegal server for the obvious purpose of shielding her illegal actions from public disclosure and exposure.” 
Comey, however, has not provided any details on whether the emails now under review are being seen for the first time by the FBI or the nature of their contents. 
Clinton’s campaign tried to play down the new review. “There’s no evidence of wrongdoing, no charge of wrongdoing,” Podesta said, in the FBI’s latest announcement that it was taking “appropriate investigative steps” after learning of emails “that appear to be pertinent” to the earlier probe. 
Clinton campaign manager Robby Mook, trying to tamp down speculation of a voter backlash this late in the campaign, said Americans had already “factored” what they knew about the email investigation into how they would cast their ballots. 
“We don’t see it changing the landscape” for undecided voters, Mook said. 
Clinton aides also said this latest controversy has further energized her supporters. 
Clinton was campaigning in Florida on Saturday, a battleground state that many analysts say Trump must win in order to have any chance of being elected. 
In recent weeks, Trump has been running behind Clinton in most public opinion polls. 
Justice Department officials, according to a source who asked not to be identified, were opposed to the FBI director’s letter being sent to Congress and believe his actions conflict with a Justice Department memo outlining instructions that agencies should not to act in ways that could influence elections. 
While Attorney General Loretta Lynch did not discuss the matter directly with Comey, the source said aides were in touch with each other. 
Comey let it be known he felt he had to send the letter as a follow-up to his congressional testimony earlier this year regarding the FBI’s probe of Clinton’s emails, the source said. 
Meanwhile, Clinton supporters rallied to her defense following Friday’s FBI disclosure. 
The Congressional Black Caucus, comprised of about 45 members of the House of Representatives, nearly all Democrats, held a news conference in Columbus, Ohio, and urged Comey to release more details.

Hillary Clinton enjoys solid lead in early voting: Reuters/Ipsos poll,"By Reuters   5:51 pm Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton leads Republican Donald Trump by 15 percentage points among early voters surveyed in the past two weeks, according to the Reuters/Ipsos States of the Nation project.   
By Maurice Tamman 
NEW YORK (Reuters) – With 11 days to go before the U.S. presidential election, Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton leads Republican Donald Trump by 15 percentage points among early voters surveyed in the past two weeks, according to the Reuters/Ipsos States of the Nation project. 
Though data is not available for all early voting states, Clinton enjoys an edge in swing states such as Ohio and Arizona and in Republican Party strongholds such as Georgia and Texas. 
An estimated 19 million Americans have voted so far in the election, according to the University of Florida’s United States Election Project, accounting for as much as 20 percent of the electorate. 
Overall, Clinton remained on track to win a majority of votes in the Electoral College, the Reuters/Ipsos survey showed. 
Having so many ballots locked down before the Nov. 8 election is good news for the Clinton campaign. On Friday, the Federal Bureau of Investigation announced that it is examining newly discovered emails belonging to Clinton’s close aide, Huma Abedin. Those emails were found on a computer belonging to Anthony Weiner, Abedin’s estranged husband, during an unrelated investigation into illicit messages he is alleged to have sent to a teenage girl. The Reuters/Ipsos survey was conducted before the news emerged Friday afternoon. 
It remains unclear whether the FBI inquiry will upset the balance in the race. The bureau disclosed nothing about the Abedin emails, including whether any of the messages were sent by or to Clinton. Over the summer, the FBI said it was closing its investigation into Clinton’s use of a private email system while secretary of state. Until Friday, her campaign seemed to have weathered the initial FBI email probe. 
Clinton has held a lead averaging four to seven percentage points in polls in recent weeks as the Trump campaign wrestled with accusations by women of groping and other sexual advances. Trump has said none of the accusations are true. He also struggled in the recent presidential debates and faced questions about his taxes. 
As of Thursday, Clinton’s odds of receiving the 270 Electoral College votes needed to win the presidency remained at greater than 95 percent, according to State of the Nation polling results released Saturday. The project estimated she would win by 320 votes to 218, with 278 votes solidly for the Democrat. 
Clinton’s lead among early voters is similar to the lead enjoyed by President Barack Obama over Republican Mitt Romney at this point of the 2012 race, according to a Reuters/Ipsos poll taken at the time. Obama won the election by 332 electoral votes to Romney’s 206. 
But even before the latest email news, it had been a difficult week for Clinton. News coverage of Trump’s accusers had diminished, while Clinton confronted the almost daily release by WikiLeaks of emails purportedly hacked from her campaign manager’s account. This week’s leaked messages raised questions about former President Bill Clinton’s finances. 
And her lead in the States of the Nation project fell slightly from last week. Though the projected Electoral College votes hardly moved, the number of states solidly for Clinton slid from 25 to 20 this week. Trump didn’t see any additional states tilt solidly to him, but he did see some gains: The swing states of Pennsylvania, Colorado, Iowa and Nevada all moved from leaning to Clinton to being too close to call. 
Still, Trump’s path to a victory is narrow, and any realistic chance rests on his winning Ohio, North Carolina and Florida. As of Thursday, Ohio remained a toss-up. Florida and North Carolina were still tilting toward Clinton, according to the States of the Nation results. 
Early voting data for Florida and North Carolina was not yet available this week. In Ohio, Clinton led Trump by double digits among early voters. The project’s broader polling suggests the state is deadlocked between the two candidates. 
In Arizona, Clinton also was solidly ahead among early voters. In the past month, Arizona has gradually moved from a solid Trump state to a marginal Clinton state, although it is still too close to call, according to the project results. 
In Georgia, she enjoyed a similar lead among early voters. Overall, Georgia leans to Trump, but his lead narrowed to five percentage points this week, down from eights points last week and 13 points a month ago. 
Even in Texas, where Trump enjoys a sizable lead, Clinton has a double-digit edge among early voters, according to project results. 
The States of the Nation project is a survey of about 15,000 people every week in all 50 states plus Washington D.C. State by state results are available by visiting http://www.reuters.com/statesofthenation/

"David Fahrenthold Strikes, Exposing Donald Trump’s False Philanthropy","By Hrafnkell Haraldsson   5:12 pm Trump sat on the stage, ""looking for all the world like an honored donor to the cause,"" and then got up and left without leaving a donation   
Not only is Donald Trump a liar and a thin-skinned crybaby, but he is selfish, never spending his own money when he can spend somebody else’s. This behavior was never more in evidence than The Washington Post ‘s David Fahrenthold’s account of a 1996 a ribbon-cutting held by the Association to Benefit Children for a nursery school, when Donald Trump showed up, sat down to appear to be a great supporter, and then left without leaving a donation: 
As Sopan Deb tweeted , 
— Sopan Deb (@SopanDeb) October 29, 2016 
Frank and Kathie Lee Gifford were big donors and it is no wonder Gifford was so shocked by Trump’s presence. What had been exposed is that Trump’s life is a sham, a gigantic show put on by him in which he parades through life pretending to be something he is not. 
As Fahrenthold explains , 
For as long as he has been rich and famous, Donald Trump has also wanted people to believe he is generous. He spent years constructing an image as a philanthropist by appearing at charity events and by making very public — even nationally televised — promises to give his own money away. It was, in large part, a facade. A months-long investigation by The Washington Post has not been able to verify many of Trump’s boasts about his philanthropy. 
That philanthropist isn’t the real Trump. The only person Trump visibly cares about is Donald Trump. He uses his Foundation to buy himself nice things, spending other peoples’ money for luxury items and collectibles. When he does make donations, it is again, because he gives no money to his own Foundation, with other peoples’ money. 
Fahrenthold says that the only donation of Trump’s own money the paper could find from the period of 2008 to today, is a $10,000 “gift to the Police Athletic League of New York City, in 2009.” 
For a man as rich as Trump claims to be, $10,000 in eight years is nothing to brag about. Not that this stops the monumental, deadbeat hypocrite that is Donald Trump from bragging anyway.",1
"Yes, The Religious Right Warns Witchcraft Could Decide This Election","By Hrafnkell Haraldsson on Sat, Oct 29th, 2016 at 8:41 pm ""That fog that’s on Christians is the collective witchcraft that comes over the Body of Christ because there’s spirits being authorized to be released""   
Coming from people who believe in something called “spiritual warfare”– a nebulous spiritual struggle taking place over and above all the talk about issues and policy positions – it is perhaps no surprise that the Religious Right should declare that their messiah – Donald Trump – is being threatened with witchcraft. 
Lance Wallnau, whose Twitter page claims to be “Your Spiritual Warfare Guide to the 2016 Election,” appeared on “The Jim Bakker Show” to push the crazy idea that “many Christians feel this fog on their head at times” and “that fog that’s on Christians is the collective witchcraft that comes over the Body of Christ because there’s spirits being authorized to be released.” 
Watch courtesy of Right Wing Watch: 
Oh sweet baby Jesus, the mighty Lance has struck out. What has happened, of course, is that the Religious Right not only endorsed but anointed a candidate who embodies the exact opposite of the values they claim to champion. It’s no wonder they feel in a fog . Metaphorically or physically, they’re selling their souls. 
Wallnau claims “The left is a smaller number of radicals better organized than the larger body of Christ who doesn’t work together,” and “That’s the dilemma that America’s in right now,” even though the left is a disparate alliance of various groups working together and the Religious Right has been organizing since Goldwater lost in ’64 . 
A hypocrite just can’t catch a break, it seems: 
The web literally is coming down on America. And what’s sad is, how many Christians feel this fog on their head at times? Do you feel that? It’s almost like everything’s going wrong. We don’t realize it’s a remnant operating strategically through organizations that are intent on shifting the American culture and discipling the country. And that fog that’s on Christians is the collective witchcraft that comes over the Body of Christ because there’s spirits being authorized to be released. 
Wherever there’s agreement, there’s power. The more unbelievers agree with the narrative that they’re hearing, the more power and authorization Satan has to manifest. So unless the church has an exposure of what the enemy’s doing and begins to agree together with a counter-strategy, we’re going to deal with more and more fog. And the worst part is—we don’t have to surrender nations to the devil. 
So if you disagree with Wallnau, if you oppose Trump, it can only because you’re manifesting the power of Satan (who in the Old Testament is God’s lieutenant, not his adversary). So pick your Testament, I suppose. 
Lance Wallnau insists he is “not a big conspiracy theorist buff,” but this doesn’t do anything to convince us he’s not some wack-a-doodle instead. This is nothing new, as a non-Christian being told that you represent a “devil” you don’t even believe exists. 
There are 2,000 years of history backing up the accusation and testifying to its usefulness for religious zealots hoping to delegitimize (or worse) their opponents. 
Without charges of Satanism and witchcraft, you don’t have the genocide of European and Middle Eastern Paganism; you don’t have anti-Jewish pogroms; and you don’t have the Crusades or the Spanish Inquisition; you don’t have witch-burnings. 
What this sort of nonsense illustrates for liberals and progressives is that we’re not fighting on the same battleground as our opponents. 
Not only do they deal in a conspiracy-laden world, a world free of facts, but a world in which what might be hiding under your bed or in your closet has real power and reason – and let’s go ahead and say sanity – do not. 
Let’s face it: Donald Trump’s biggest enemy is not Satan, but Donald Trump himself. And Wallnau can claim “believers have an edge” all they want, but all the belief in the world won’t overturn reality.",1
Early Voting Is So Strong For Democrats That Clinton Could Lock Up Nevada this Week,"On Meet The Press, Clinton campaign manager Robbie Mook said that early voting is so strong for Democrats in Nevada that Hillary Clinton could build an insurmountable lead this week. 
Video: 
Chuck Todd asked Mook if he believed the email story could cost Clinton the election. 
He answered: 
I don’t think so. Look, as I said, we have over 50,000 volunteers out there. We’re seeing record early voting numbers in North Carolina, Florida. Look, I would wager in Nevada turnout is so strong among Democrats there Hillary could build an insurmountable lead in the coming days in Nevada. We’re feeling really good about this record turnout. Over 200 million people in our country now registered to vote. Fifty million of those are young people. We’re just nose to the grindstone, and we’re going to finish this out. But people should not take anything for granted, and we’re going to have to work hard to earn this.” 
Hillary Clinton could put Nevada out of reach for Trump this week, but whether or not that happens is up to the voters. If Democrats continue to vote in overwhelming numbers in swing states, the email story won’t matter. If Democrats don’t show up, that is Trump’s only chance of winning. 
The early voting numbers that Hillary Clinton is running up in Florida, North Carolina, and Nevada are no accident. Clinton and the Democratic Party have invested heavily in an extensive get out the vote operation in early voting states. 
Democrats already had a strategic advantage in early voting before the 2016 election, but Donal Trump’s refusal to invest in a substantial get out the vote operation has widened the gap between the two parties in this area. 
The final week before the election could be just as vital to Democrats in swing states as election day. If Hillary Clinton piles up big margins in early voting, it could leave minimal drama for election night. 
The Democratic early voting plan is working to perfection, now as Mook said, all that is left is for Democrats to put their heads down, work hard, and close the deal.

Hillary Clinton Maintains Swing State Leads As Comey Email Letter Flops,"By Jason Easley on Sun, Oct 30th, 2016 at 10:52 am Republicans hoped that FBI Director James Comey's letter about new Clinton related emails would swing the election for them, but a new series of CBS News Battleground polls shows Clinton keeping her lead and within 2 points of Trump in Arizona. Share on Twitter Print This Post 
The CBS News Republicans hoped that FBI Director James Comey’s letter about new Clinton related emails would swing the election for them, but a new series of CBS News Battleground polls shows Clinton keeping her lead and within 2 points of Trump in Arizona. 
Battleground tracker found that by a small margin Comey’s letter made Democrats more likely (net +7) to support Clinton. 
In the individual battleground states, Clinton leads by eight points in Pennsylvania 48%-40%, North Carolina (48%-45%), and in Colorado (42%-39%). The only state of the four polled where Trump has a small two point lead in Arizona (44%-42%). 
According to CBS News , “And the larger demographic difference defining the race between Clinton and Donald Trump has been a gender gap – slightly larger now than the last time in these states – that offsets a smaller movement of Republicans to Trump.” 
To put it another way, Hillary Clinton’s support with women is going up at a larger rate than Republican movement towards Trump. 
These are the first swing state polls to be taken since FBI Director Comey released his now infamous letter on Friday. The email story isn’t moving voters. It is reinforcing the partisanship of the election. Democrats are going to vote Clinton. Republicans are going to vote for Trump, and there aren’t enough undecided voters to swing the election to Trump. 
Republicans were hoping for a Hail Mary touchdown to save Trump, but Clinton continues to lead in critical states with a little more than a week to go before election day. If the Comey letter is the big October surprise, it isn’t working on voters.

Email Pandemonium and the Perpetuation of Rape Culture,"By Robert Franek on Sun, Oct 30th, 2016 at 9:01 am Imagine if working to end rape culture were treated with the same attention as Hillary Clinton’s emails. This is one fire that is burning strong and is a true threat to personal and public safety, security, and well-being. Share on Twitter Print This Post 
The following post, written by The Rev. Robert A. Franek, is a part of Politicus Policy Discussion, in which writers draw connections between real lives and public policy. 
Even after months and months of coverage blown out of proportion and at great expense to the public in dollars, psychic stress, and issue coverage ,it seems all one has to do is put Hillary Clinton and emails together in the same sentence with claims of lying and threatening national security and pandemonium continues to break loose throughout the mass media and social media worlds. And yet despite multiple investigations and repeated explanations the pandemonium persists, so much so that every time Republicans stir up some smoke the media assumes there must be a blazing fire. And sadly this is not going away anytime soon, as Republicans are promising more sham investigations in lieu of actually governing as Sarah Jones reported. 
Republicans are already planning how to avoid being grown ups who do their jobs if Hillary Clinton is elected president. Yes, there will be more toy-throwing and tantrums and best of all for the party of fiscal humiliations, more wasteful spending on political witch hunts. – Sarah Jones 
Meanwhile, women continue to come forward with painful, heartbreaking stories of Donald Trump’s sexual harassment and assault. Yet, instead of being portrayed as survivors who have finally had enough of the Republican presidential nominee and his lies and as women who have the strength and courage to go public with their stories, they are being made into opportunistic victims and challenged for not coming forward sooner much sooner. Woefully, no mention is made of the many intersecting reasons that lead many women (and men) not to report these crimes, including that this is the only time when the victim is placed on trial. 
After walking her readers through one incident of Donald Trump’s public sexual humiliation of a woman for revenge , Sarah Jones makes the following observation: 
If there is any good to come out of the total crapfest of the Trump candidacy, perhaps it is a raised awareness that women are people and that this kind of thing is horrific but it’s not all Trump’s fault. It’s the culture’s fault because it takes a willing audience to successfully publicly sexually shame a woman. 
She is right. Donald Trump is despicable. Still, there is cultural culpability in the perpetuation of rape culture where women are treated as objects, forced into silence, and placed on trial for their assailant’s crimes. 
This must change. 
It is unacceptable in a country that places such a high value on freedom that so many are not free from sexual harassment, assault, exploitation, and humiliation. More it is appalling that such behavior is often cheered, unchallenged, and dismissed. It is also inexcusable that survivors face unparalleled levels of scrutiny when they do finally come forward. 
It is also beyond tragic that people of faith who read the first chapter of Genesis can’t bear out the implications of men and women being created simultaneously and bearing equally the divine image. 
Supposed Christian values champion and Republican Vice Presidential nominee, Mike Pence is more upset over an article he didn’t read regarding voter suppression efforts by the Trump campaign than any of the horrifying things Donald Trump has said including bragging about sexual assault. 
These are not Christian values nor are they values any civil society should hold. Failing to call out Donald Trump’s abhorrent behavior and speech is beyond deplorable. Additionally, supporting candidates like Donald Trump and Mike Pence gives validity to their wretched views and is especially shocking when done by people of faith and “family values.” 
As a society, we must challenge the pervasive and systemic sexism and misogyny that persists in our culture. As much as we need changes in our laws (and lawmakers!) at every level of government to reflect the equality and humanity of women, we need a moral revival in our collective conscience as a nation that decries every facet of rape culture from how we raise our children to the victim blaming and shaming that happens each time a survivor goes public with their story. 
Imagine if working to end rape culture were treated with the same attention as Hillary Clinton’s emails. This is one fire that is burning strong and is a true threat to personal and public safety, security, and well-being.

Comey’s October Surprise Blows Up In His Face As Democrats Drop The Hammer On FBI Boss,"Senate Democrats aren’t playing around with FBI Director James Comey. Four top Democrats sent Comey and Attorney General Loretta Lynch a letter demanding details on the emails that the FBI is investigating by Monday. In the letter, Sens. Carper, Leahy, Feinstein, and Cardin wrote: 
Senate Democrats aren’t fooling around. They want answers, and they want them right now. As more details become known, FBI Director Comey’s motives have come under criticism. Comey was advised by Attorney General Lynch not to send his letter until after the election, but he sent it anyway. 
Comey worried to FBI employees that his letter would be misunderstood, but he could have easily avoided any misunderstanding by either being specific in his letter or not sending the letter at all. It is becoming difficult to look at Comey’s actions in an objective manner and not see partisan political motivations. 
The FBI Director has interfered in a presidential election with new emails that have nothing to do with the Democratic nominee, but can be used by her opponents for political purposes. 
Democrats are demanding answers, and if James Comey doesn’t answer their questions by Monday, he will be forced to under oath if the Democratic Party wins a majority of seats in the Senate. 
Either way, Comey’s October surprise has blown up in his own face.",1
George W. Bush’s Ethics Lawyer Files Complaint Against FBI Director James Comey,"Richard W. Painter wrote in a New York Times an op-ed: The F.B.I.’s job is to investigate, not to influence the outcome of an election. 
Such acts could also be prohibited under the Hatch Act, which bars the use of an official position to influence an election. That is why the F.B.I. presumably would keep those aspects of an investigation confidential until after the election. The usual penalty for a violation is termination of federal employment. 
And that is why, on Saturday, I filed a complaint against the F.B.I. with the Office of Special Counsel, which investigates Hatch Act violations, and with the Office of Government Ethics. I have spent much of my career working on government ethics and lawyers’ ethics, including two and a half years as the chief White House ethics lawyer for President George W. Bush, and I never thought that the F.B.I. could be dragged into a political circus surrounding one of its investigations. Until this week. 
This is the second complaint to be filed against FBI Director Comey. The Democratic Coalition Against Trump has also filed a complaint against Comey for interfering in a presidential election as a federal employee. 
Suspicion around Comey’s actions has grown as the FBI Director is not expected to make any additional statements on this matter before the presidential election. Director Comey appears to have set himself for problems after the election as Senate Democrats are making it known that they are open to holding hearings to investigate the FBI investigation if they win back the Senate majority. 
Unless Trump wins and Republicans take control of Congress, Director Comey is going to have to answer for his decisions. 
As the complaints pile up, it looks like Congressional testimony may be the least of James Comey’s future problems.",1
Fox News Gets Destroyed While Trying To Blame Hillary Clinton For GOP Email Scandal,"By Jason Easley on Sun, Oct 30th, 2016 at 2:37 pm Fox News Sunday's Chris Wallace tried to blame Hillary Clinton for the email scandal that Republicans created and got destroyed by Clinton campaign manager Robbie Mook. Share on Twitter Print This Post 
Fox News Sunday’s Chris Wallace tried to blame Hillary Clinton for the email scandal that Republicans created and got destroyed by Clinton campaign manager Robbie Mook. 
This exchange between Fox News Sunday host Chris Wallace and Clinton campaign manager Robbie Mook highlighted why the email scandal isn’t working for the GOP. 
Video: 
Transcript via Fox News Sunday: WALLACE: The last question I want to ask you is that you’re acting as if it was the director who brought this into the election when the fact is that it was Hillary Clinton who brought this into the election. 
I want to go back to the e-mail exchange on March 2nd, 2015, when The New York Times broke the story about Hillary Clinton using private e-mails. We’re going to put it up on the screen. 
Clinton adviser Neera Tanden, “Why didn’t they get the stuff out like 18 months ago? So crazy.” 
Campaign chairman John Podesta, “Unbelievable.” Tanden, “I guess I know the answer, they wanted to get away with it.” 
Robby, it was Clinton who delayed and it was Clinton who brought this into the presidential campaign. 
MOOK: And it is Secretary Clinton who has said this was a mistake. It is Secretary Clinton who cooperated fully with the investigation. And it was Secretary Clinton who accepted the outcome of that investigation. And what secretary Clinton is doing now is saying, if there’s new information, get it out on the table. Let’s get it out. These could be duplicates. 
Again, it’s been reported these e-mails may not have been sent or received by Secretary Clinton. We don’t know anything. And this close to an election, this unprecedented announcement of new information, when – when, again, it’s been reported by Yahoo! News that – that the FBI may have not even seen it. That – that – that Director Comey sent this unprecedented letter shortly before the election when he doesn’t even know what the information is. That’s disturbing. And we’re just asking him, get everything out there that he knows. 
Fox News has no evidence of wrongdoing on the part of Clinton, so they have been reduced to whining about why she didn’t release the emails sooner. What Wallace left out was that the release of Clinton’s emails represented an unprecedented level of disclosure. 
Hillary Clinton didn’t cause this email scandal. House Republicans misused their Benghazi Select Committee to go on a fishing expedition for Hillary Clinton’s emails. 
Robbie Mook destroyed Fox News with facts, because unlike Donald Trump, Hillary Clinton hasn’t worked to keep information hidden from the public. Trump has not released his tax returns, medical records, or an accounting of his business dealings with Russia. Trump has been the least transparent nominee in more than 40 years. 
Republicans and conservative media are blaming Clinton for the scandal that they created as justification for continuing the investigations of her after the election. 
Clinton’s campaign manager was able to wipe the floor with the Republican talking points because at the end of the day the email scandal remains a conspiracy about nothing.",1
Trump Thug Chants “Jews S A” at Arizona Rally,"By Adalia Woodbury on Sun, Oct 30th, 2016 at 1:43 pm A Trump supporter sporting a “Hillary for Prison” t-shirt chanted “Jews S-A” in support of his candidate during a rally in Arizona on Saturday.

A Trump supporter sporting a “Hillary for Prison” t-shirt chanted “Jews S-A” in support of his candidate during a rally in Arizona on Saturday. 
The target was the pen of reporters who have been fodder for Trump’s rhetoric at every rally. 
The context: While the crowd was chanting “USA” one man chanted “Jews S-A”. Words like that can’t be spun or read into. The intent and meaning were obvious to everyone. 
Watch here on video obtained by The Huffington Post . 
This sort of thing comes as no surprise considering that Donald Trump spent the last year spewing hate filled venom in every possible direction. It may seem superfluous to restate every category of people for which Trump has shown contempt, but it is not. 
Muslims, Jews, immigrants, labor, taxpayers, Latinos, Hispanics, Mexicans, African-Americans, women, POW’s, veterans, people with disabilities, Gold Star Families, and the military have felt the sting of Trump’s words and the disdain in his heart. 
Throughout this campaign season, the vitriol against Hillary Clinton saw no limit. Signs and T-shirts too disgusting to quote in this article. Chants of “lock her up” at the Republican convention and since. Trump promised his base of thugs, lowlifes, and haters he would weaken the first amendment, strengthen the second and establish the alt-right utopia. 
Hillary Clinton was already the most qualified candidate in this race. She also proved to have more stamina than any previous candidate needed. Not only was she competing against a vicious and pathological liar, she was competing for who we are and who we could be. For all the Trump claims that the media is rigged in Clinton’s favor, it was Trump who got free advertising, who framed the narrative and whose words were the primary “news” stories of the campaign. 
There is no doubt that Hillary Clinton will keep her promise to fight for us. She has been doing it from the beginning of this campaign. Every time Hillary Clinton called out Donald Trump’s sexist comments, she was fighting for all women who were attacked, humiliated and sexually abused by men like Trump. Every time Clinton shamed Trump’s horrific and disgusting comments about the Khan family she was standing up for every Gold Star family. She was also standing up for every Muslim-American. The same is true every time Clinton condemned Trump for mocking a disabled reporter or resorted to alt-right stereotypes about African-Americans, inner-cities, and African-American communities. 
Every time Trump spewed hate in whatever direction, Hillary Clinton defended the target. 
So no, this isn’t about choosing the lesser of two evils. Like every election, this is about choosing our next president. More importantly, it’s about voting for who we are and who we aspire to be.

The Top Democrat In The Senate Just Accused FBI Director James Comey Of Breaking The Law,"Here is the full text of Sen. Reid’s letter to Director Comey: Dear Director Comey: 
Your actions in recent months have demonstrated a disturbing double standard for the treatment of sensitive information, with what appears to be a clear intent to aid one political party over another. I am writing to inform you that my office has determined that these actions may violate the Hatch Act, which bars FBI officials from using their official authority to influence an election. Through your partisan actions, you may have broken the law. 
The double standard established by your actions is clear. 
In my communications with you and other top officials in the national security community, it has become clear that you possess explosive information about close ties and coordination between Donald Trump, his top advisors, and the Russian government – a foreign interest openly hostile to the United States, which Trump praises at every opportunity. The public has a right to know this information. I wrote to you months ago calling for this information to be released to the public. There is no danger to American interests from releasing it. And yet, you continue to resist calls to inform the public of this critical information. 
By contrast, as soon as you came into possession of the slightest innuendo related to Secretary Clinton, you rushed to publicize it in the most negative light possible. 
Moreover, in tarring Secretary Clinton with thin innuendo, you overruled longstanding tradition and the explicit guidance of your own Department. You rushed to take this step eleven days before a presidential election, despite the fact that for all you know, the information you possess could be entirely duplicative of the information you already examined which exonerated Secretary Clinton. 
As you know, a memo authored by Deputy Attorney General Sally Yates on March 10, 2016, makes clear that all Justice Department employees, including you, are subject to the Hatch Act. The memo defines the political activity prohibited under the Hatch Act as “activity directed towards the success or failure of a political party, candidate for partisan political office, or partisan political group.” 
The clear double-standard established by your actions strongly suggests that your highly selective approach to publicizing information, along with your timing, was intended for the success or failure of a partisan candidate or political group. 
Please keep in mind that I have been a supporter of yours in the past. When Republicans filibustered your nomination and delayed your confirmation longer than any previous nominee to your position, I led the fight to get you confirmed because I believed you to be a principled public servant. 
With the deepest regret, I now see that I was wrong. 
Sincerely, 
Senator Harry Reid 
Reid basically accused Comey of violating the Hatch Act by releasing his letter so close to a presidential election. Even though Harry Reid is retiring, the bad news for Comey is that Reid’s letter is a clear sign that Senate Democrats aren’t going to let this matter drop. 
If Democrats take back the Senate, Director Comey should brace himself, because he and his agency’s methods are going to be under Congressional investigation.",1
October Shocker: FBI Has Explosive Information on Trump Conspiring With Putin,"By Sarah Jones on Sun, Oct 30th, 2016 at 8:59 pm Senator Harry Reid dropped the bomb that the FBI and national security experts possess ""explosive information"" about ties and coordination between Russia and Donald Trump and his campaign.

Talk about burying the lede. 
In Senator Harry Reid’s letter in which he suggests that FBI Director James Comey may have broken the law (the Hatch Law), he also drops the bomb that the FBI and national security experts possess “explosive information” about ties and coordination between Russia and Donald Trump and his campaign. 
Reid writes, “In my communications with you and other top officials in the national security community, it has become clear that you possess explosive information about close ties and coordination between Donald Trump, his top advisors, and the Russian government – a foreign interest openly hostile to the United States, which Trump praises at every opportunity.” 
Reid points out the “disturbing double standard” in Comey’s treatment of sensitive information between the two parties with a “clear intent” to aid one over the other. 
If the FBI and national security experts have information that Donald Trump and or his campaign are colluding or collaborating to bring about a particular result regarding the U.S. election or our foreign policy stances, this is an emergency. 
Which issue is so much of an emergency that a federal official might consider dropping the bomb just 11 days before an election: Electing someone who is conspiring with Russia or electing someone whose aide may have sent an email she forget to tell everyone about. 
The double standard is not only troubling at this point, but dangerous. 
Bomb dropped. 
Everyone already suspected Trump’s ties to Russia and his campaign has been full of ties to the Kremlin, but now Reid has confirmed information about coordination between Trump and Russia. 
Now that, ladies and gentlemen, is an October shocker. 
Reid’s full letter follows: 
Dear Director Comey: 
Your actions in recent months have demonstrated a disturbing double standard for the treatment of sensitive information, with what appears to be a clear intent to aid one political party over another. I am writing to inform you that my office has determined that these actions may violate the Hatch Act, which bars FBI officials from using their official authority to influence an election. Through your partisan actions, you may have broken the law. 
The double standard established by your actions is clear. 
In my communications with you and other top officials in the national security community, it has become clear that you possess explosive information about close ties and coordination between Donald Trump, his top advisors, and the Russian government – a foreign interest openly hostile to the United States, which Trump praises at every opportunity. The public has a right to know this information. I wrote to you months ago calling for this information to be released to the public. There is no danger to American interests from releasing it. And yet, you continue to resist calls to inform the public of this critical information. 
By contrast, as soon as you came into possession of the slightest innuendo related to Secretary Clinton, you rushed to publicize it in the most negative light possible. 
Moreover, in tarring Secretary Clinton with thin innuendo, you overruled longstanding tradition and the explicit guidance of your own Department. You rushed to take this step eleven days before a presidential election, despite the fact that for all you know, the information you possess could be entirely duplicative of the information you already examined which exonerated Secretary Clinton. 
As you know, a memo authored by Deputy Attorney General Sally Yates on March 10, 2016, makes clear that all Justice Department employees, including you, are subject to the Hatch Act. The memo defines the political activity prohibited under the Hatch Act as “activity directed towards the success or failure of a political party, candidate for partisan political office, or partisan political group.” 
The clear double-standard established by your actions strongly suggests that your highly selective approach to publicizing information, along with your timing, was intended for the success or failure of a partisan candidate or political group. 
Please keep in mind that I have been a supporter of yours in the past. When Republicans filibustered your nomination and delayed your confirmation longer than any previous nominee to your position, I led the fight to get you confirmed because I believed you to be a principled public servant. 
With the deepest regret, I now see that I was wrong. 
Sincerely, 
Senator Harry Reid",1
Trump Campaign Has A Nervous Breakdown After Comey Letter Fails To Swing The Election,"The Trump campaign is having a collective nervous breakdown after the James Comey letter about new Hillary Clinton emails failed to swing the election in his direction.

The Trump campaign is now that reality detached place where a few true believers are running the show. This is why Trump is going to spend the last week of his presidential campaign in blue states that he has no chance of winning. Trump still thinks that he can win Michigan, Wisconsin, and New Mexico. Wisconsin might be the most laughable of three delusions because Trump was routed in the Republican primary there, and GOP support from Wisconsin Republicans like Paul Ryan and Scott Walker has been lukewarm at best. 
These are the final days that all losing campaigns go through when the nominee refuses to accept the likelihood of their defeat. The Comey letter didn’t move the needle for Trump. It didn’t give him a surge of national momentum or make the majority of voters rethink their support for Hillary Clinton. 
The Clinton emails didn’t save Trump, so now he is going to waste his time campaigning in states that he will lose in search of a miracle as his poorly managed presidential bid stumbles to the finish line.",1
Call On President Obama to Terminate F.B.I. Director Comey on November 9,"By Rmuse on Sun, Oct 30th, 2016 at 9:53 pm The F.B.I. has a solemn obligation to remain neutral in political matters; the faintest appearance of using the agency to influence our election is deeply troubling. Share on Twitter Print This Post *The following is an opinion column by R Muse* 
As a nation of laws, the American people should, and most likely do, demand that law enforcement officials hew as closely to the law as humanly possible and that goes double for the country’s largest investigative agency. One thing every American who has ever watched a law enforcement press conference after a crime has occurred understands is that the public never really knows the details of an investigation regardless the severity of the crime or who the suspect is. As an occasional print journalist, this author can attest that asking a police spokesman for details during a press conference about what the police are doing or who they are investigating never fails to get a stern scolding about expecting law enforcement to reveal any facts during an investigation for glaringly obvious reasons. The scold always includes referral to the agency responsible for charging and prosecuting a crime after the investigation is complete and the results are handed over to the local district attorney. 
Apparently, the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) director James Comey never got the memo that discussing an investigation publicly is verboten; if for no other reason than to maintain the integrity of said investigation and not hamper a possible prosecution. However, as it turns out Mr. Comey did get “a memo ” from the Department of Justice in the form of a warning . But because he is a law unto himself and his allegiance is to House Republicans and not the Department of Justice, he ignored the DOJ counsel to do a solid for the GOP less than two weeks before a presidential election. 
Since Mr. Comey can’t keep it (investigations) in his pants, or follow long-standing law enforcement and investigative rules, or take heed to Justice Department warnings, it is incumbent on President Barack Obama to summarily fire F.B.I. Director James Comey on the morning of Wednesday, November 9th 2016. Why should President Obama wait until the day after a general election to fire the partisan director of the F.B.I.? So as not to give the appearance of any impropriety or partisanship during a campaign or just prior a presidential election; something FBI director James Comey is apparently incapable of comprehending. 
This incident, just like the one in July when Comey broke precedent and convened a press conference in July, and then publicly testified before Congress to discuss the Bureau’s ongoing investigation is more than just a breach of precedent; it smacks of partisanship for more than one reason. First, as mentioned above, not only did the Department of Justice warn Mr. Comey that it was inappropriate to discuss an ongoing investigation at all, much less so close to an election, that warning came after the F.B.I. contacted the DOJ about going public with information the Bureau admitted it had not yet even “ reviewed .” That was precisely what Comey told his Republican buddies in a letter to Congress. 
In the letter , Comey told congressional Republicans that the F.B.I. really had no clue whether any of the emails were related to Hillary Clinton’s private email server, but what he did “ know ” for sure was that they “ appeared ” to be pertinent; even though his agency, the F.B.I. had not yet examined them. So the real pertinent question is: why did Mr. Comey publicly inform Congress about emails the agency had not yet examined if he wasn’t attempting to inject some ‘ partisan drama ’ into the election that might have deleterious impact on the outcome? 
It is just as pertinent a question as demanding to know from Mr. Comey precisely what his motivation was in holding a press conference back in July to discuss the agency’s finding on an investigation before the DOJ weighed in, or discuss that investigation in public and before a viciously partisan Republican committee in Congress. And no, it was not to defend the Bureau’s decision not to bring criminal charges against Clinton; only a brain-dead moronic imbecile or partisan Republican hack would begin to think that the F.B.I., C.I.A., local sheriff, or any police investigative agency has the ability to bring charges to prosecute a violation. For dog’s sake even the 1960’s fictional sheriff Andy Griffith’s hapless deputy Barney Fife was competent enough to comprehend that a district attorney’s office or Department of Justice is tasked with prosecution any violation of the law. 
According to Mr. Comey, who was “ stung by criticism from both Democrats and Republicans ” as well as former prosecutors and “ appeared to be on the defensive ;” “ he felt obligated to inform [Republicans in] Congress ” even though the Bureau really didn’t “ know the significance of this newly discovered collection of emails. ’’ Likely because he knew they did not come from Hillary Clinton. As an aside, Sarah Jones has a nifty summary of the “email” caper the F.B.I. Uncovered while investigating “ serial sexter ” Anthony Weiner’s laptop computer, iPad, and cellphone. And no, Anthony Weiner was not sexting nasty pictures to presidential candidate Hillary Clinton. 
It doesn’t matter what kind of pathetic excuse Comey gave for publicly commenting on an ongoing investigation, it is virtually impossible to believe he didn’t have partisan intents and purposes in publicly alerting House Republicans. As interim chairwoman of the Democratic National Committee, Donna Brazile said, “ The F.B.I. has a solemn obligation to remain neutral in political matters – even the faintest appearance of using the agency’s power to influence our election is deeply troubling .” Ms. Brazile demanded more information from Comey and didn’t conceal her concern over Comey interfering with the election. 
Mr. Comey claimed, very conveniently one might add, that as a died-in-the-wool Republican he contributed to John McCain and Willard Romney’s presidential campaigns in 2008 and 2012 respectively, that he is not a Republican now. That was his remark back in July when he first began breaking precedent and revealing information about an investigation that was the proper purview of the Department of Justice, not the Federal Bureau of Investigation. It was a suspicious “ confession ” in July and it is nearly impossible to believe in late October after he ignored Department of Justice warnings and revealed information about an ongoing investigation into a disgraced former congressman and serial sexter just 11 days before an election and before the Bureau had even reviewed anything. 
Comey cannot possibly remain as head of the Federal Bureau of Investigation after twice revealing information about an ongoing investigation. If Comey hadn’t taken heat for his ‘reveal’ in July, and a warning from the Justice Department this week, then one might just regard him as an inept law enforcement official pulling a publicity stunt for attention. But since he was warned, and is not an inept law enforcement official, it is more than reasonable to believe that Comey’s most recent act was a partisan political ploy that should earn him a summary termination on November 9, 2016. Because firing his partisan personage just prior to the general election would break a longstanding precedent and look like a highly partisan move; something a sap like James Comey might try, but not President Obama.",1
Supreme Court Decides to Weigh in On Transgender Rights,"By Adalia Woodbury on Sun, Oct 30th, 2016 at 11:31 pm On Friday, the Supreme Court decided to weigh in on transgender rights in the case of Gloucester County School Board vs. G.G. This gives the right wing another chance to take civil rights away from people they don’t like. Plain and simple. Share on Twitter Print This Post 
On Friday, the Supreme Court decided to weigh in on transgender rights in the case of Gloucester County School Board vs. G.G . This gives the right wing another chance to take civil rights away from people they don’t like. Plain and simple. 
At issue is whether a transgender student who identifies as a boy has a right to use the bathroom that corresponds with the gender he identifies with. 
Last summer, the court granted the school board’s request to put a lower court ruling in the student’s favor on hold until the board filed its petition for review by the Supreme Court. Justice Breyer joined the conservative justices in that ruling as a courtesy. 
The Virginia school board established a policy mirroring “bathroom police” laws in red states like North Carolina that required students to use rest rooms and locker rooms to correspond with the gender they were assigned at birth. 
In this case, the district court ruled against G.G. by relying on a 1975 regulation allowing schools to provide “separate toilet, locker room and shower facilities based on sex” provided those facilities are comparable to those provided to the opposite sex. 
In January 2015, the Department of Education’s Office of Civil Rights issued a letter opining that if schools separate students in restroom and locker rooms based on their sex a “school must treat transgender students” in a manner consistent “with their gender identity.” 
Because of that letter, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 4th Circuit reversed the lower court ruling in favor of G.G. It relied on a 1997 Supreme Court decision that courts generally should defer to an agency’s interpretation of its own regulation. 
In reality, the right wing hopes to achieve two political objectives with this case. First, this is about denying basic rights and dignity to people who are transgender, which is consistent with their ideological opposition to rights for women, POC and members of the LGBT community. Second, the right wing is hoping to weaken Federal Agencies by attacking their ability to interpret their own regulations.",1
Donald Trump Destroyed as Fact Checker Reveals Trump Lies 20 to 37 Times Per Day,"By Hrafnkell Haraldsson on Mon, Oct 31st, 2016 at 7:59 am In Donald Trump ""you have a candidate who is frequently saying 20 false things in a day, up to 37 on some days."" Share on Twitter Print This Post 
CNN’s Brian Stelter calls Donald Trump a “uniquely fact-challenged candidate,” which is a prelude to introducing Daniel Dale, Washington correspondent for the Toronto Star , who fact checks every single word Trump utters and tallies them up for his paper . 
Dale says most fact-checkers look at two or three things Trump says, “meticulously fact-checks them and posts an article,” but “that doesn’t work when you have a candidate who is frequently saying 20 false things in a day, up to 37 on some days.” 
For example, Dale tallied 35 Trump lies on Tuesday, October 25: Donald Trump said 35 false things yesterday. #TrumpCheck pic.twitter.com/EwfYFEDFx9

Which, as Dale pointed out , followed “his record-tying 37 false claims on Monday,” not coincidentally, a day on which Trump called fact checkers “scum.” 
Watch courtesy of CNN’s Reliable Sources: ""There is a massive imbalance in the frequency of dishonesty."" @DDale8 says Trump lies a lot more than Clinton https://t.co/Kp6KvPNtmO 
— Reliable Sources (@ReliableSources) October 30, 2016 
The mainstream media likes to play the false equivalence game but there is no equivalence between Trump and Clinton. As Dale told Stelter, “There is a massive imbalance in the frequency of dishonesty.” Trump, says Dale, “is not a normal political liar.” 
For example, look at the presidential debates , in which Dale found 104 Trump false statements as opposed to 13 by Clinton. 
Dale’s judgment is that “there is no comparison in her level of accuracy with her opponent.” 
Trump also lies “pointlessly,” argues Dale, explaining to Brian Stelter that, 
“He gets things wrong where there is no political advantage to be gained and in those cases, it is not clear whether he’s lying or confused or unwilling to take the time to learn the facts.” 
This was Mark Cuban’s complaint, of course, that Trump has no interest in learning. 
In the end, it matters less why Trump lies than that he does, especially since he is busily convincing his base that Hillary Clinton is the dishonest candidate. And it is working. This is a trope frequently repeated by Trump’s supporters. You can correct them as often as you want; it will have no effect. 
The lie has taken hold – one of many – many more than you likely expected, and observational bias takes care of the rest. The Trump base is effectively lost to our shared reality, and as Dale tweeted last night, 
“If Trump loses, the Smart Republican Excavation is going to have to involve some long, hard base re-education.” 
Given the GOP’s history with facts, good luck with that.

The Catholic Church Uses Tax-Exempt Funds To Stop Marijuana Legalization,"By Rmuse   10:03 am ""The archdiocese holds the matter among its highest priorities. If passed, the law would have significantly detrimental impacts on our parishes, our ministries""   *The following is an opinion column by R Muse* 
For almost all secular humanists, organized religion is nothing more than an easy means of controlling people through fear and intimidation. Throughout recorded history, the Catholic Church has been responsible for all manner of devious machinations to control not just its adherents, but any humans it comes in contact with. That lust to control human beings has continued unabated into the 21st Century and in America like the rest of the Earth the Catholics number one focus has been on controlling women. Apparently, the Catholic Church in Massachusetts wants to expand its control over the population. 
On Friday the Boston Globe reported that the Archdiocese of Boston dropped about a million dollars in a last-ditch effort to exert Church control over Massachusetts law and citizens to stop marijuana from being legalized for recreational use. Other reports reveal that the tax-exempt political spending is meant to help defeat a Massachusetts ballot measure, Question 4 . Question 4 simply legalizes cannabis for recreational use for people over 21 and creates a commission to regulate marijuana in the state of Massachusetts. Question 4 contains no references to the Catholic, or any other church, and makes no claim of trying to “ impact ministries .” 
A spokesman for the Boston Archdiocese, Terrence Donilon, made a truly pathetic attempt at justifying the Catholic church’s political donation to the campaign against Massachusetts’ version of legalized recreational marijuana saying : 
“ It reflects the fact that the archdiocese holds the matter among its highest priorities. It’s a recognition that, if passed, the law would have significantly detrimental impacts on our parishes, our ministries .” 
Seriously, that has to be one of the most monumental piles of bovine excrement of a reason to use tax-free congregants’ donations to interfere in an election ever offered. Nowhere in Massachusetts’ or any state’s decriminalization statutes is any church mentioned, much less affected by the outcome of an election. Catholic priests will still be free to sexually abuse little boys if adults can legally purchase and consume cannabis. And despite residents having a toke in the privacy of their homes, the Church will still frighten its members into increasing their tithes, and the USCCB will still attempt to control and dominate all American women. No reefer decriminalization will impact the Catholic ministry, but it will drastically reduce the number of people being arrested and imprisoned for marijuana possession, free up law enforcement to pursue nasty pedophile priests, and relieve America’s over-burdened judicial system. 
Now, the Catholics claim that people using cannabis legally, whether they inhale or eat it, will have “ significantly detrimental impacts on their ministries .” That is an odd assertion on yet another point; Surely part of “Catholic ministries” is teaching according to their god’s word in the Christian bible. It is nearly certain that every Catholic priest on the planet, including those in Massachusetts, are aware of god’s word in Genesis where in chapter 2, verse 9 the Catholics’ “ almighty god ” said: 
“ Out of the ground the LORD God caused to grow every tree that is pleasing to the sight and good for food. ” And he continues in verses 15-17 , “ Then the LORD God took the man and put him into the garden of Eden to cultivate it and keep it. The LORD God commanded the man, saying, “From any tree of the garden you may eat freely, but from the tree of the knowledge of good and evil you shall not eat, for in the day that you eat from it you will surely die .” 
Although there is recorded evidence that cannabis was first discovered to be used for its medicinal qualities 10,000 years ago , there is no record of reefer ever being confused with “ The tree of the knowledge of good and evil; ” weed is not and will not affect the Catholic ministries if it is decriminalized today any more than it has over the past two-thousand years the Catholic Church has existed and cannabis was either unknown to the clergy or illegal. 
In a reaction to the news the archdiocese was interfering with politics with tax-exempt money, an advocate and spokesman for the Yes on Question 4, Jim Borghesani, said : 
“ The archdiocese has come up with a position that, frankly, we think is based on unfounded assumptions and junk science. What I think the archdiocese is missing is the terrible harm that (marijuana) prohibition has done to people of color, to people who have chosen a substance that is less dangerous than alcohol and have had their lives ruined because they’ve been arrested .” 
One wonders if part of the Boston archdiocese’s ministry entails increasing the number of Americans, mainly Americans of color, sent to prison for possessing or using a plant that “ god caused to grow ” and was “ pleasing to the sight and good to eat .” Obviously, that is the case and according to a new set of data, keeping marijuana illegal means keeping Americans arrested for drug possession at a rate of every 25 seconds of every day of the year. 
Why is the Catholic Church so interested in perpetuating the failed “War on Drugs in general, and the criminalization of marijuana in particular?” As noted by Michael Stone over at Patheos, what the Massachusetts Catholics, and Mormons, are actually helping to sustain is “ in reality a war on poor people and people of color .” Mr. Stone really nails it when he said that by spending tax-exempt donations on a political agenda to “ defend the unjust prohibition on marijuana; the Catholic church is guilty of perpetuating the failed War on Drugs and the New Jim Crow .” 
The archdiocese is also guilty of hypocrisy, besides implicit racism. Because any religious organization that condones and even promotes the use of alcohol while using tax-exempt donations to maintain the ridiculous prohibition on cannabis is “ morally indefensible .” Mormons are also busy instructing LDS members to vote against all state initiatives that seek to decriminalize and regulate recreational marijuana use as if it has any affect whatsoever on either their private Mormon lives or their LDS ministry, but they allegedly don’t condone or enjoy alcohol so they just have control issues and are not blatant hypocrites; at least where cannabis decriminalization is concerned. 
The Massachusetts Catholics may not be violating the law by “ acting as an anti-marijuana super PAC ,” but they are using tax-exempt member donations to politically influence an election and control other Americans’ lives; the church is all about wielding ultimate control over all facets of American society. However, if the Church is so flush with money; why not use that money to compensate the thousands of victims of the Church’s pedophile priests? Or, dog forbid, use that tax-exempt donors’ money to help the people of Massachusetts in need. 
The Catholic Church is guilty of using fear and intimidation to control its own adherents, and that is down to frightened people needing a ‘ daddy’ figure in the Church to tell them what is right, what is wrong, and how to stay out of the proverbial Hell; that is all well and good for people that willingly cry out for a controlling organization speaking for a deity. But for people that are not “ in the church ” it is an affront to use donated tax-exempt money to impact (read control) their private lives. The only good news out of this abominable story is that it looks like Question 4 will pass with relative ease informing that the archdiocese wasted about a million dollars of its congregation’s hard-earned money. 
This is yet another example of why all churches should be taxed like every other business and American citizen, except Donald Trump. It is “ morally obnoxious ” that the archdiocese is using the congregations’ donations for political purposes to influence an election and yet another sign that there is no area the church considers as out of bounds in attempting to control every aspect of society with tax-exempt funds wrung out of hardworking Americans, many of whom use recreational cannabis.

"Donald Trump Whines Because ISIS Cuts off Heads, We Should be Able to Waterboard","By Hrafnkell Haraldsson   9:24 am ""We can’t do waterboarding, it’s far too tough! We’re fighting on a different level! we have to be tough...and in some cases pretty vicious""   
Donald Trump complains about spending a fortune on a war in the Middle East that he supported, a war brought to us by a Republican administration that knowingly lied about the facts. Trump is also lying about the facts, which at least brings our country’s Middle East ordeal full-circle. 
According to Trump, speaking at a rally in New Mexico – and you’ve no doubt seen the barrage of commercials repeating the same lie – “Hillary brought disaster to Iraq, Syria, Libya and every place that she touches. She empowered Iran and she unleashed ISIS by leaving that big vacuum.” 
Of course, it was Republican President George W. Bush who negotiated the balance of forces agreement with Iraq, stipulating that America draw down its combat strength. Reneging on that agreement would have meant not peace in Iraq, or a negation of ISIS, but a second U.S. invasion on top of the rise of ISIS. 
“We want peace through strength,” Trump told the crowd. “We don’t want to be in wars but these savages are chopping off heads.” 
Well, in fact we DID want to be in that war. We invaded Iraq, not vice versa. 
Trump went on to say, 
“Drowning people in steel cages, burying people in the sand. We haven’t had – this is medieval times. This is medieval times and then we can’t do waterboarding, it’s far too tough! You know, we’re fighting on a different level! See, we’re fighting on a different level folks and we have to be tough and we have to be smart and we have to be in some cases pretty vicious, to be honest with you. Pretty vicious, but we have to take them out and then we have to get back to building our country because our country – we’ve spent $6 trillion in the Middle East. $6 trillion. And we could’ve rebuilt our country twice.” 
Never mind for a moment that torture is illegal under international law; never mind that a 2014 Senate Intelligence Committee’s report said torture doesn’t work; Trump’s argument sounds once again like a child wanting to get back at another child who has aggrieved him. 
This is Trump wanting to spite his enemies on an international scale, and arguing to boot that the end justifies the means. 
He doesn’t, because he can’t, prove that acting like barbarians somehow doesn’t make us barbarians ourselves. He certainly can’t prove, because that Senate report says otherwise, that torturing people will win the war. 
The claim of $6 million, by the way, is one Trump made last week in Charlotte, NC as well, and PolitiFact ruled it “half true” at the time, saying, 
Trump is citing the high-end estimate of credible analyses of spending associated with the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. Yet he is confusing money that’s been spent with money that researchers say will be spent. 
The point here is that this is a war begun not by Obama and certainly not by Hillary Clinton, who at least admits she supported it and has apologized for doing so, while Trump continued to deny he was ever for it, despite the facts to the contrary. 
When Trump says “we have to be pretty vicious” he is also saying “we have to be pretty dishonest,” and nobody lies with such success or at such a rate as Donald Trump. 
Trump has said he loves war. He has said he likes to be unpredictable. He has asked why we can’t use nuclear weapons since we have them. This is a man most national security experts say should not have the nuclear football in his hands. 
This is a man who, no matter how much he claims otherwise, does not understand how the world works. And he does not understand that by promoting torture, he is only fulfilling the wildest propaganda wishes of the Islamic State, by promising to do precisely what they want him to do.",1

What will these call captains do? Oh, “monitor” other the show and discussions, give talking points — you know, propaganda: 
I am willing to help! (check all the apply) I am willing to serve as a Trump Talk Radio Blitz Call Captain, taking responsibility to monitor and recruit other callers for one or more talk radio programs between now and election day 
I am willing to be a Trump Talk Radio Blitz Caller and select one or more 15 minute segments for local talk radio shows to call into and promote Donald Trump’s campaign 
Call “Captains” will be in charge of entire shows to make sure the Trump message gets out and “monitor” discussions lest anyone bring any facts to the air: 
Call Captains will sign up to be responsible for an entire talk radio program or programs between now and the election to 1) help recruit callers to call in and promote Donald Trump’s campaign throughout the program for that day, 2) remind Trump Talk Radio Blitz Callers who have sign up of their commitment to call into the show, 3) help ensure your Trump Talk Radio Blitz Callers are prepared to discuss the show’s topics, 4) monitor the show and the discussions, and 5) report your successes back to the campaign.

I mean, it’s working so well for the Trump spokespeople, especially those propaganda artists embedded on a certain cable network. Why not organize non-professionals to give the same talking points and disseminate them in a way that appears “organic”. LOL, I kid. If you’ve run into these people in a comment section or forums you know they have the campaign message down so exactly as to be a screaming siren of talking points. 
So when you hear screaming tinfoil about fake polls and accusations that Hillary Clinton committed treason even though she was actually cleared, you needn’t worry that your entire country has gone insane. 
This is the last gasp of a sinking campaign trying to fool the voters with media propaganda dished out by “volunteers”.",1
It Turns Out Trump Put off Investigators for 6 Months While He Destroyed Emails,"By Hrafnkell Haraldsson on Mon, Oct 31st, 2016 at 12:20 pm Trump “refused 2 produce records sought by prosecutors for 6 months. Said under oath: Was destroying them whole time.” Share on Twitter Print This Post 
Newsweek’ s Kurt Eichenwald has struck again, reporting that Donald Trump “refused 2 produce records sought by prosecutors for 6 months. Said under oath: Was destroying them whole time.” 
The whole strategy, he writes at Newsweek in an article he swears was written before Comey’s announcement, was “deny, impede and delay, while destroying documents the court had ordered them to hand over.” 
In 1973, he reveals, “the Republican nominee, his father and their real estate company battled the federal government over civil charges that they refused to rent apartments to African-Americans.” 
Shortly after the government filed its case in October, Trump attacked: He falsely declared to reporters that the feds had no evidence he and his father discriminated against minorities, but instead were attempting to force them to lease to welfare recipients who couldn’t pay their rent.The family’s attempts to slow down the federal case were at times nonsensical. Trump submitted an affidavit contending that the government had engaged in some unspecified wrongdoing by releasing statements to the press on the day it brought the case without first having any “formal communications” with him; he contended that he’d learned of the complaint only while listening to his car radio that morning. But Trump’s sworn statement was a lie. Court records show that the government had filed its complaint at 10 a.m. and phoned him almost immediately afterward. The government later notified the media with a press release. […] Six months after the original filing, the case was nowhere because the Trumps had repeatedly ignored the deadlines to produce records and answers to questions, known as interrogatories….Finally, under subpoena, Trump appeared for a short deposition. When asked about the missing documents, he made a shocking admission: The Trumps had been destroying their corporate records for the previous six months and had no document-retention program. They had conducted no inspections to determine which files might have been sought in the discovery requests or might otherwise be related to the case. Instead, in order to “save space,” Trump testified, officials with his company had been tossing documents into the shredder and garbage. 
So Trump can accuse Hillary Clinton of destroying emails – and he does, nearly every day – but only as a means of covering up and deflecting his own misdeeds in that regard. 
“With false affidavits and ‘deny and delay” strategies,” writes Eichenwald, “Trump & his cos hid and destroyed records sought in court.” 
Donald Trump is a world class liar and a man known for his deflection tactics, projecting his own guilt onto others. His Foundation in trouble? Point the finger at the Clinton Foundation. Sexual assault allegations? Point the finger at Bill and Hillary Clinton. 
Once again, Kurt Eichenwald has dug into Donald Trump’s deplorable past and revealed the real Donald Trump. It’s not pretty. And each revelation from Eichenwald and David Fahrenthold shows Trump to be an even worse human being than the last. 
It is no wonder his deplorables love him so much.

Ethics Complaint Filed Against Rep. Jason Chaffetz for Releasing Comey Clinton Email Letter,"An ethics complaint has been filed against Representative Jason Chaffetz for releasing information provided to him in a letter from FBI Director James Comey. 
The Democratic Coalition Against Trump announced the complaint in a statement: 
The Democratic Coalition Against Trump filed a complaint against Representative Jason Chaffetz on Monday morning with the Office of Congressional Ethics for his role in releasing information provided to him by FBI Director James Comey. 
“Representative Chaffetz, in an ill-planned partisan attempt, released information that compromised the integrity of the FBI, when he irresponsibly tweeted out that the case investigating Secretary Clinton’s emails had been reopened, when in fact it had not been. Members of Congress are elected to make our country a safer, better place- not to use their power to work with leaders such as Comey in a partisan fashion. I hope that both are held accountable for their actions,” said Scott Dworkin, Senior Advisor to the Democratic Coalition Against Trump. 
Director Comey is already facing a complaint that was filed with Department of Justic e accusing him of violating the Hatch Act by using his position as a federal employee to influence the outcome of an election. 
The Comey letter couldn’t have gone much worse for Republicans. What the GOP originally hoped was an election shifting moment had become a Republican scandal that Democrats are strongly suggesting will inspiring hearings if they win back the Senate majority . 
Thanks to Chaffetz, House Republicans have already their credibility for future Clinton investigations, a s the Utah Republican’s spin of Comey’s letter was debunked in a matter of hours. 
It’s all gone wrong in short order for Republicans. Comey and Chaffetz are facing complaints, and Hillary Clinton remains on course to be elected the next President Of The United States.",1
Explosive Audio Surfaces Of GOP Senator Joking About Gun Owners Shooting Clinton,"By Sean Colarossi on Mon, Oct 31st, 2016 at 7:56 pm CNN has obtained audio of North Carolina GOP Senator Richard Burr joking about gun owners putting a ""bullseye"" on Hillary Clinton. Share on Twitter Print This Post 
CNN has obtained brand new audio of North Carolina Republican Senator Richard Burr joking about gun owners putting a “bullseye” on Hillary Clinton. 
The despicable comments come as Burr faces a close Senate race against Democratic opponent Deborah Ross. Both candidates are within a point of each other, according to RealClearPolitics. 
More of the CNN report : 
The North Carolina Republican, locked in a tight race for reelection, quipped that as he walked into a gun shop “nothing made me feel better” than seeing a magazine about rifles “with a picture of Hillary Clinton on the front of it.” 
“I was a little bit shocked at that — it didn’t have a bullseye on it,” he said Saturday to GOP volunteers, prompting laughter from the crowd in Mooresville, North Carolina. “But on the bottom right (of the magazine), it had everybody for federal office in this particular state that they should vote for. So let me assure you, there’s an army of support out there right now for our candidates.” 
This type of rhetoric is hardly uncommon when it comes to Republican leaders in 2016. As the campaign has gone on, the hateful and violent rhetoric, particularly from the man at the top of the Republican ticket, has become increasingly worse. 
At one point this year, Donald Trump suggested that “Second Amendment people” should take up arms against Clinton if she nominates a Supreme Court justices they don’t like. He also said that he’d like to “see what happens” if the Democratic nominee’s bodyguards were disarmed. 
As CNN notes, Trump has never issued a genuine apology for his dangerous language – or anything he’s ever said or done – but Burr quickly came out with a statement once the audio was revealed, although it does not excuse what he said. 
“The comment I made was inappropriate, and I apologize for it,” the Republican senator said, according to CNN. 
This type of imagery has no place in our politics, regardless of whether it’s being said in public or private, especially given the heightened level of anger and hatred toward Hillary Clinton from Trump supporters. 
Whether it’s Trump or Burr, voters should remember their irresponsible language when they go to vote in just one week.",1
Comey Bias Exposed As FBI Boss Refused To Call Out Russians For Hacking Before Election,"By Jason Easley on Mon, Oct 31st, 2016 at 4:22 pm A new report is painting CIA Director James Comey as having used his office to influence the presidential election, as Comey sent a letter about Hillary Clinton's emails, but refused to call out Russia for meddling in the election by hacking Democrats. Share on Twitter Print This Post 
A new report is painting CIA Director James Comey as having used his office to influence the presidential election, as Comey sent a letter about Hillary Clinton’s emails, but refused to call out Russia for meddling in the election by hacking Democrats. 
CNBC reported : FBI Director James Comey argued privately that it was too close to Election Day for the United States government to name Russia as meddling in the U.S. election and ultimately ensured that the FBI’s name was not on the document that the U.S. government put out, a former FBI official tells CNBC. 
…. 
According to the former official, Comey agreed with the conclusion the intelligence community came to: “A foreign power was trying to undermine the election. He believed it to be true, but was against putting it out before the election.” Comey’s position, this official said, was “if it is said, it shouldn’t come from the FBI, which as you’ll recall it did not.” 
Director Comey didn’t want to interfere in the presidential election by releasing information that could harm Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump, but he had no qualms about sending a letter to Congress about emails that he had never seen in an apparent effort to interfere in the current presidential election. 
With each new revelation and detail, it is becoming impossible not to come to the conclusion that FBI Director Comey may have violated the Hatch Act with his letter to Congress. It is illegal for federal employees to use their positions to interfere in elections. 
When the information was bad for Donald Trump, Comey argued that it should not be publicly released so close to the election. However, he embraced a different standard when he had less information but could frame it in a way that could damage Hillary Clinton’s campaign. 
It is becoming clear that Comey has abused his power and must be removed as FBI Director immediately.",1
Trump Is Deadbeating On His Campaign Debts By Refusing To Pay His Own Pollster,"The Washington Post reported: Donald Trump’s hiring of pollster Tony Fabrizio in May was viewed as a sign that the real estate mogul was finally bringing seasoned operatives into his insurgent operation. 
But the Republican presidential nominee appears to have taken issue with some of the services provided by the veteran GOP strategist, who has advised candidates from 1996 GOP nominee Bob Dole to Florida Gov. Rick Scott. The Trump campaign’s latest Federal Election Commission report shows that it is disputing nearly $767,000 that Fabrizio’s firm says it is still owed for polling. 
Trump’s decision not to pay his pollster is the first of this type of story but given Trump’s history of not paying for services performed; it won’t be the last. It is astonishing that the party of supposed fiscal responsibility and conservativism would put someone forward as their presidential nominee who has made a career out of running up debt for personal gain. 
Donald Trump’s mentality has always been to put himself first. Paying his debts never seems to have been a top priority for Trump. His businesses have been stiffing vendors and contractors for decades, so it isn’t surprising that he would bring this same mentality to the presidential campaign. 
Anybody who works for the Trump campaign would be smart to get paid up front because Donald Trump’s version of making America great involves taking your money and putting it in his own pocket.

Trump Crushed By Hillary Clinton’s New Powerful Closing Argument To Women,"The Hillary Clinton supporting Priorities USA super PAC has released a powerful ad that makes the closing argument for why women should get out to vote and support the Democratic nominee. 
Video: 
The ad is set to the Carole King classic “Natural Woman” as sung by her daughter. The ad features clips of ordinary women living their lives mixed with clips of Elinor Roosevelt, Rosa Parks, Sally Ride, and Hillary Clinton. Two-thirds of the way through the ad, Trump appears and audio of him calling women fat pigs, slobs, fat asses, and flat chested among other insults. On the screen are shots of women holding up up cards with the hashtag vote. 
The message is clear, powerful, and absolutely devastating. 
Women need to vote against the behavior of Donald Trump. The words of Donald Trump and his treatment of women must be rejected. It is time for all Americans of conscience to lead the way, but if we are realistic about US society, it will be women who lead the way. Women will provide the moral voice that rejects Trump. According to the polling, it will be women who lead the way for Hillary Clinton to win the presidential. 
CNN asked the Trump campaign for comment about the ad, and their request was met with silence because Donald Trump’s own words did all the talking that voters need to hear.",1
New Report Uncovers Secret Trump Server That Repeatedly Communicated With Russia,"By Sean Colarossi on Mon, Oct 31st, 2016 at 8:47 pm While the media continues to focus on the Clinton email non-story, news about Donald Trump's ties to Russia continues to gain steam. Share on Twitter Print This Post 
While the media continues to focus on what is increasingly becoming a non-story – FBI Director James Comey’s vague letter regarding more emails related to Hillary Clinton – news about Donald Trump’s ties to Russia continues to gain steam. 
Not only did NBC just report that the FBI is now in the preliminary stages of investigating Trump’s ex-campaign manager’s connection to Russia, but Slate also reported on Monday that a Trump server may have repeatedly been communicating with a Russian bank. 
Slate claims that while a group of computer scientists was looking into the Russian cyber attack of the DNC, they stumbled onto something unexpectedly. 
The report: 
In late July, one of these scientists—who asked to be referred to as Tea Leaves, a pseudonym that would protect his relationship with the networks and banks that employ him to sift their data—found what looked like malware emanating from Russia. The destination domain had Trump in its name, which of course attracted Tea Leaves’ attention. But his discovery of the data was pure happenstance—a surprising needle in a large haystack of DNS lookups on his screen. “I have an outlier here that connects to Russia in a strange way,” he wrote in his notes. He couldn’t quite figure it out at first. But what he saw was a bank in Moscow that kept irregularly pinging a server registered to the Trump Organization on Fifth Avenue. 
More data was needed, so he began carefully keeping logs of the Trump server’s DNS activity. As he collected the logs, he would circulate them in periodic batches to colleagues in the cybersecurity world. Six of them began scrutinizing them for clues. 
The researchers quickly dismissed their initial fear that the logs represented a malware attack. The communication wasn’t the work of bots. The irregular pattern of server lookups actually resembled the pattern of human conversation—conversations that began during office hours in New York and continued during office hours in Moscow. It dawned on the researchers that this wasn’t an attack, but a sustained relationship between a server registered to the Trump Organization and two servers registered to an entity called Alfa Bank. 
This news doesn’t come out of nowhere. Trump has repeatedly praised Vladimir Putin as a strong leader, all while taking pro-Russia positions throughout the campaign that come straight off a Kremlin wishlist. 
The Clinton campaign was quick to jump on the report in a statement by Clinton Senior Policy Adviser Jake Sullivan: 
This secret hotline may be the key to unlocking the mystery of Trump’s ties to Russia. It certainly seems the Trump Organization felt it had something to hide, given that it apparently took steps to conceal the link when it was discovered by journalists. 
This line of communication may help explain Trump’s bizarre adoration of Vladimir Putin and endorsement of so many pro-Kremlin positions throughout this campaign. It raises even more troubling questions in light of Russia’s masterminding of hacking efforts that are clearly intended to hurt Hillary Clinton’s campaign. We can only assume that federal authorities will now explore this direct connection between Trump and Russia as part of their existing probe into Russia’s meddling in our elections. 
Trump’s pro-Russia rhetoric and policy positions are not a coincidence. The more information that comes out, the clearer it is that the Republican nominee has connections to Russia that he is hiding from voters. 
With just a week until Election Day, this is the explosive story the media should be focusing on. It’s critical that the American people know what kind of financial ties a potential president has with an American adversary, especially when that adversary is Russia.",1
Donald Trump May Have Broken The Law To Avoid Paying Federal Income Taxes,"By Sean Colarossi on Mon, Oct 31st, 2016 at 9:52 pm Trump used a “tax avoidance maneuver so legally dubious his own lawyers advised him that the Internal Revenue Service would likely declare it improper if he were audited.” Share on Twitter Print This Post 
While Donald Trump has repeatedly said he took advantage of loopholes that allowed him to legally pay nothing in federal income taxes for decades, the New York Times reported on Monday that Trump may have actually crossed a legal boundary to avoid paying his fair share. 
According to the Times, the Republican nominee used a “tax avoidance maneuver so legally dubious his own lawyers advised him that the Internal Revenue Service would likely declare it improper if he were audited.” 
The report: 
Tax experts who reviewed the newly obtained documents for The New York Times said Mr. Trump’s tax avoidance maneuver, conjured from ambiguous provisions of highly technical tax court rulings, clearly pushed the edge of the envelope of what tax laws permitted at the time. “Whatever loophole existed was not ‘exploited’ here, but stretched beyond any recognition,” said Steven M. Rosenthal, a senior fellow at the nonpartisan Tax Policy Center who helped draft tax legislation in the early 1990s. 
Moreover, the tax experts said the maneuver trampled a core tenet of American tax policy by conferring enormous tax benefits to Mr. Trump for losing vast amounts of other people’s money — in this case, money investors and banks had entrusted to him to build a casino empire in Atlantic City. 
The reason that Trump bent over backward – and potentially broke laws – to avoid paying these taxes is because he was scrambling to “stave off financial ruin.” 
This is the same man who claims he would be a great president because of his “successful” business background. 
Yet, he calls himself the “king of debt.” His businesses have declared bankruptcy six times. He has spent decades paying zero dollars in federal income taxes. He lost a billion dollars in a single year running a casino business. Reporting out tonight even suggests that he has direct financial ties to Russia. 
All of this is just the tip of the iceberg when it comes to his business background. 
Even as all of this information is out there, American voters still know very little about Donald Trump’s finances because he has refused to be transparent about them. 
And consider this: What Trump is hiding in his tax returns must be much worse than the already damning information that keeps coming out through good reporting. If it weren’t, he would have already released them. 
The latest New York Times story is just the latest installment of Trump’s shady business background. The media should spend the remaining week of this campaign demanding more answers from a man who wants to be in charge of the country’s pocketbook.",1
Bad News For Republicans As Court Intervenes In Their Voter Intimidation Scheme,"By Sarah Jones on Tue, Nov 1st, 2016 at 12:30 am The United States District Court in New Jersey ordered discovery on Donald Trump and the RNC's poll monitoring efforts, with a hearing on November 4th, just days before the November 8th election. Share on Twitter Print This Post 
Republicans are being ordered to explain their comments that they will be monitoring the polls for “voter fraud”. 
The United States District Court in New Jersey ordered discovery on Donald Trump and the RNC’s poll monitoring efforts, with a hearing on November 4th, just days before the November 8th election. 
The order demands affidavits from several parties, including from someone with personal knowledge about the defendant’s (RNC’s) efforts with the Trump campaign to monitor precincts around the country, “as indicated by Kellyanne Conway”. 
Affidavits are also demanded from several Republican operatives in various states who are said to be conducting state wide “voter fraud” monitoring and poll monitoring, such as RNC member Rob Gleason’s efforts to recruit persons to act as poll watchers in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania and RNC member Ronna Romney McDaniel’s efforts in Michigan to prepare a “massive, statewide anti-voter fraud effort”. 
The RNC must also answer for Governor Mike Pence’s comments that the Trump campaign is working with state governments and secretaries of state to ensure “ballot integrity”. 
This is what happens when you have zero regard for election law and try to go vigilante. 
Rick Hasen at Election Law Blog noted that the discovery granted is pretty broad, “Pretty broad discovery required in short order, with hearing on November 4.” 
However, “The judge rejected much of the discovery sought by the DNC given the time frame, but this should alone should be pretty educational on what efforts are actually going on behind the scenes.” 
The DNC filed a lawsuit against the Republican National Committee for violating a 1982 court order intended to prevent voter intimidation over Donald Trump’s claims that the election is rigged and that his supporters need to go to the polls to intimidate voters. 
Donald Trump’s urging that his supporters go to polling places other than their own (often in “urban” areas) to watch voters is a clear violation of the consent decree and the court isn’t likely to stand for it. 
So now discovery has been court-ordered, which is just more bad news for Republicans who are already facing an uphill battle in their bid for the White House. 
It’s exceptionally unpatriotic to try to intimidate fellow citizens from exercising their right to vote. Everyone has the right to vote free of intimidation. Don’t let anyone dissuade you from voting.

Mainstream Media Ignoring 75 Lawsuits Against Trump to Focus on Clinton Emails,"By Hrafnkell Haraldsson on Tue, Nov 1st, 2016 at 8:00 am ""Last spring...New York had to take legal action to collect $8,578 in unpaid taxes on the Trump-owned company that owns the trademark Boeing 757""   
We looked yesterday at Kurt Eichenwald’s revelation that Donald Trump put off investigators for six months while busily destroying emails. That is hardly Trump’s only misdeed, but how many people realize that Donald Trump, at this moment, has 75 – SEVENTY-FIVE – legal issues hanging over his head. 
He’s lying 20 to 35 times a day and has his followers – and with much less excuse, the mainstream media – thoroughly distracted by the Clinton email nonstory so he can divert their attention away from his own legally questionable activities. 
USA TODAY reported at the end of October that “Just two weeks before Election Day, at least 75 of the 4,000-plus lawsuits involving Trump and his businesses remain open, according to an ongoing, nationwide analysis of state and federal court records by USA TODAY.” 
It will surprise no one, because Trump is already deadbeating on his own pollster , that “One Trump case, over non-payment of tips to caterers at Trump SoHo Hotel in New York City, is scheduled to go to trial a week before Election Day.” 
If one thing has become clear throughout this election it is that Trump does not pay his bills. Earlier, we had covered an incident where he had declined to finish paying a Florida contractor for work it did on one of his resorts, having decided that the contractor had been “paid enough,” even though it wasn’t the agreed-upon amount. Trump got nailed by the court for $300K in attorney’s fees in that case. 
Just a few examples from USA TODAY’s investigation: 
Trump faces significant open litigation tied to his businesses: angry members at his Jupiter, Fla. golf course say they were cheated out of refunds on their dues and a former employee at the same club claims she was fired after reporting sexual harassment. There’s a fraud case brought by Trump University students who say the mogul’s company ripped them off for tens of thousands in tuition for a sham real estate course. Trump is also defending lawsuits tied to his campaign. A disgruntled GOP political consultant sued for $4 million saying Trump defamed her. Another suit, a class action, says the campaign violated consumer protection laws by sending unsolicited text messages. 
As pointed out by USA TODAY’s Nick Penzenstadler and John Kelly, these lawsuits will dog Trump into the White House, should he win. He will have no immunity because he is president. And America – and the world – will be treated to the spectacle of the President of the United States having to make trip after trip to the court to settle his highly questionable personal and business affairs. 
There are harassment cases, sex discrimination lawsuits, fraud, unpaid bills, racist comments, defamation, cases involving Trump University. As USA TODAY notes, “as recently as last spring…New York had to take legal action to collect $8,578 in unpaid taxes on the Trump-owned company that owns the trademark Boeing 757 that jetted the mogul to campaign rallies across the country.” 
And those 75 cases will likely grow. 
Trump has promised, after all, to sue The New York Times and each of the women – NYMag maintains an exhaustive list – who have accused him of sexual assault. 
USA Today says it spent six months researching court records. “The exclusive analysis,” they say, “found an unprecedented mountain of legal battles for a presidential candidate, ranging from skirmishes with pageant contestants to multimillion dollar real estate lawsuits. The cases offer clues to the leadership style the billionaire would bring to the White House.” 
Donald Trump claims Clinton is tainted. He claims Clinton’s emails are bigger than Watergate. The other day tweeted , “We must not let #CrookedHillary take her CRIMINAL SCHEME into the Oval Office. #DrainTheSwamp.” 
This comes from the man who would turn the 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue into a morality No-Go Zone. 
All the facts – including the new disclosures about Trump’s ties to a Russian server and his potentially illegal ploy to avoid paying taxes – make it clear that if Trump the deadbeat liar drains the swamp, he will be the first one down the drain.",1
North Carolina Republicans Sued For Rigging the Election For Trump,"By Rmuse   10:00 am The voter suppression tactic is right out of the GOP [election rigging] playbook to suppress the Black vote in North Carolina.”   *The following is an opinion column by R Muse* 
Some Americans are likely aware of the psychological term “projecting” that roughly means a person attributes their own faults and actions onto someone else; as an ‘unconscious’ form of transferring guilt for one’s own actions. As soon as the Republican primaries concluded, Donald Trump projected Republicans’ guilt for election rigging, either through vote obstruction or suppression, onto Democrats and his opponent Hillary Clinton. Republicans have been actively suppressing votes since the election of Barack Obama in 2008, and they have only ramped up their ‘ election rigging’ activities over the past eight years; and yet Trump accuses Democrats of election rigging as frequently as most human beings draw breath. 
Yesterday, the North Carolina conference of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) filed a lawsuit against North Carolina Republicans and demanded they put an immediate stop to the “ coordinated effort to suppress the Black vote in the state .” What the NAACP rightly said was that the voter suppression tactic was “ right out of the GOP [election rigging] playbook to suppress the Black vote in the state. ” 
The election rigging amounts to three counties in North Carolina canceling voter registration of thousands of, mostly African American, Democratic residents a week before the presidential election. The lawsuit charged election officials in Beaufort, Moore, and Cumberland counties of denying primarily African American voters’ eligibility to participate in democracy because their voter registration documents mysteriously were “ bounced back as undeliverable. ” 
Most of the voters whose eligibility to vote was denied and flagged for purging, such as James Edward Arthur Sr. had moved within the same county and were still legally allowed to cast ballots. Many of the purged voters lived at their “ original registration address ” and were victims of a “ simple postal service error. ” 
Mr. Arthur is an African American who lives in a nursing home and has voted in at least the last 14 elections in the same county he was born and raised in without issue. Arthur testified that he, like thousands of other African American Democratic voters, never received any state or county election documents informing him that his eligibility was denied, or that if he didn’t attend an appeal hearing to maintain his right to vote he would be denied the right to participate in democracy. Mr. Arthur said, 
“ If I knew my right to vote was in jeopardy, I would do whatever I could to protect it. I want and plan to vote in the upcoming election, but I am concerned that since my registration has been canceled I will not be able to cast a ballot or it will not be counted .” 
It is what any sane human being would consider “ election rigging ” simply because the tri-county ploy targeted primarily African Americans who typically vote for Democrats. It is also something North Carolina Republicans have been guilty of for the past six years. 
According to the NAACP lawsuit, North Carolina Republicans are in violation of the National Voter Registration Act which “ bans the systemic removal of voters from the rolls in the final 90 days before an election .” Republican election officials State officials defended their “ election rigging ” and said they were justified in “ purging tens-of-thousands ” of mainly African American Democratic voters’ eligibility, the definition of systemic, on an individual basis. 
However, the NAACP also accused Republicans of conducting a coordinated mailing campaign for the sole purpose of challenging the eligibility of thousands of mainly African American voters’ eligibility who did not receive the mailing. One Republican who ran for a local office last year, Shane Hubers, challenged the registration of voters, the majority who are them Democrats,  in Beaufort County. 
In one of the other counties charged in the lawsuit, Cumberland County, one “ individual used returned mail to challenge the registrations of 3,951 mostly Democratic voters .” In Moore County, the secretary of the local Republican Party, N. Carol Wheeldon, challenged approximately 400 mainly African American registered voters; likely because they do not vote for Republicans. 
The lead attorney for the NAACP’s lawsuit, Penda Hair, said that although she cannot yet prove there is a concerted Republican “ election rigging ” conspiracy; 
“ We know that in two of the counties, the people who brought the challenges had connections to the local Republican Party. We also know that the pattern of these challenges is very similar across the counties .” Ms. Hair also noted that, “ in Moore County the return address of a right-wing group called the Voter Integrity Project appeared on the mail that was used to challenge voters. This is a very pernicious treatment of voters ,” she said. It is also a deliberate act of “ election rigging ” by Republicans. 
The president of the North Carolina NAACP, Reverend Dr. William Barber said, 
“ We are seeing the worst attempts of voter suppression here in North Carolina that we’ve seen since the days of Jim Crow. The Tar Heel state is ground zero in the intentional, surgical efforts to suppress the voice of voters. These attempts are a direct affront to our Constitution .” 
The NAACP lawsuit is demanding the state reinstate all voters challenged since 2012 using this “election rigging ” process back on the rolls immediately. The organization also demands that the state notifies the voters that they have been reinstated as eligible voters, and allow them to cast regular ballots early or on Election Day. They have already put in a request for an emergency hearing this week to decide the case. 
It might be the case that the NAACP’s request for a hearing may be granted; especially in light of these new charges arising just days after a federal court ruled that North Carolina Republicans violated the National Voter Registration Act in yet another manner; failing to add tens of thousands of voters to the rolls who registered at a DMV office over the past few years. 
Last Thursday U.S. District Court Judge Loretta Biggs ordered North Carolina Republicans to permit those tens-of-thousands of voters to cast provisional ballots. It is highly doubtful that North Carolina Republicans will obey the Federal Judge’s orders because they have been the recipients of several court orders over their “election rigging” actions that have had no effect whatsoever or the Republicans would not continue disenfranchising voters. 
Republicans have been on a tear to rig elections since the American people first elected Barack Obama as President, and the conservatives on the Supreme Court are ultimately guilty of conspiring with Republicans to suppress, or obstruct, the voting rights of primarily people of color because they don’t support Republicans. To be perfectly clear, it is irrelevant if it is called voter suppression, obstruction, or disenfranchisement; it is a deliberate attempt to rig elections. And it is only Republicans and the Koch brothers’ outfit the American Legislative Exchange Council (ALEC), who are behind each and every attempt in Republican-controlled states to kill democracy by doing what the Republican Party standard bearer Donald Trump is guilty of projecting; rig elections.",1
Rachel Maddow Shines the Light on Trump’s White Supremacist Support,"By Hrafnkell Haraldsson   9:04 am The KKK newspaper features the front page full page story ""Make America Great Again"" with a big featured center photo of Donald Trump   
Rachel Maddow traces the history of the post-Civil War “Enforcement Acts” signed by President Ulysses S. Grant, including the Ku Klux Klan Act , or The Enforcement Act of 1871 (17 Stat. 13), which still makes it illegal to conspire to intimidate voters. 
To show that the Klan Act is not “vestigial” but very much relevant in this election, Maddow points to the citation of this law by the Democrat Party in a “whole raft of lawsuits” in Nevada, Arizona, Pennsylvania and Ohio alleging voter intimidation. 
Maddow points out that though voter intimidation is illegal anyway, the significance of the Klan Act is that it prohibits “conspiracy” to “prevent by force, intimidation, or threat, any citizen who is lawfully entitled to vote, from giving his support or advocacy in a legal manner, toward or in favor of the election of any lawfully qualified person as an elector for President or Vice President, or as a member of Congress of the United States.” 
As an example of the role the KKK plays in Trump’s campaign, Maddow produced the KKK’s newspaper of today, which bills itself as “The Political Voice of White Christian America,” which, you might note, is identical with Fox News demographic. This paper, she says, “has been turning up on front lawns in the great state of Georgia.” 
Watch courtesy of MSNBC (discussion begins at 9:15 mark): 
Tonight we just got a hold of this disgusting development. This is the newspaper of the Ku Klux Klan today. It’s The Crusader, the political voice of white Christian America. The premier voice of white resistance. They’ve got — you see the white power symbol there in the upper right-hand corner? They’ve got a whole media operation going on apparently. Watch white pride TV, listen to KKK radio 24 hours a day. This newsletter is about 12 pages long, features articles on “the threat of nonwhite immigration,” a very subtle feature on black people committing terrible crimes against white people. There’s an article by the founder of the America First Party which is all about the terrorist Jews. He brags in his byline that he’s the man who David Duke credits for awakening him to the threat of Jewish supremacism. It’s exactly what you would think from the Ku Klux Klan newspaper. If you knew there was a Ku Klux Klan newspaper these days. But the front page full page story is “Make America Great Again” with a big featured center photo of Donald Trump. It’s one of several articles in the paper about Trump, including this in-set article about how Trump’s candidacy is “moving the dialogue forward.” […] Those are a couple of the many, many robocalls that were made during the Republican primary campaign on behalf of Donald Trump’s candidacy, calls made by a white nationalist group that calls itself the American National Super PAC. The Trump campaign doesn’t appear to have anything to do with these calls. They reportedly returned a donation from the white nationalist guy who you hear on the call when it was first reported that he was making these calls and that he was a Trump donor. It was further embarrassing to the Trump campaign when this guy, this farmer and white nationalist who does these robocalls, he was initially picked to be a Trump delegate to the Republican Convention this year before his delegate status once got yanked once it was widely reported. 
Donald Trump’s white supremacist followers have made no secret of the fact that they want a “White homeland” and that, of necessity, the United States must be this White homeland. As Maddow has pointed out in the past, and by their own admission, their “eugenics insanity” is now out in the open because of Donald Trump. 
Don’t believe Maddow? Demographics Pro looked at “10,000 Donald Trump Twitter supporters [and] found that more than one third follow white nationalist Twitter accounts.” 
The fact is, Trump has mainstreamed white supremacy and by not strongly denouncing it, brought it into his own “movement,” which seems to be a meeting place for much more than disaffected white working-class Americans, whatever the mainstream media tells you.

Trump Kills The GOP With The Lowest Score In History Of Presidential Leadership Poll,"In a major omen of potential election disaster for Republicans, Donald Trump has scored the lowest rating in the history of Gallup’s presidential leadership poll. 
Gallup released their presidential leadership survey, and the results were historically bad for Donald Trump: 
Voters rate Trump worse than any other presidential candidate in Gallup’s records on having the personality and leadership qualities a president should have. Previous readings were taken in late October in the 2000, 2004 and 2008 campaigns. In those years, between 52% and 61% of registered voters said the two major-party candidates had the right personality and leadership qualities — a sharp contrast to Trump’s current 32%. Clinton’s rating of 51% is one percentage point below the previous low score. 
Clinton’s score, while low, was one point of the range for previous presidential cycles going back to 2000. Trump’s score was twenty percent below the lowest score in the history of the poll. 
Voters aren’t going to elect a man to be the next president who they view as lacking the basic qualities of presidential leadership. The popular vote total in 2016 may reflect the nation’s political polarization, but there is a reason why electoral map projections continue to look very good for the Democratic candidate. 
Donald Trump has failed the most elemental test for any presidential candidate. He doesn’t look, act, or behave like a person who has the qualities needed to occupy the Oval Office and lead the United States of America. 
The last week before election day tension that is in the air is normal, but the fundamental motivating factors of this contest haven’t changed. Democrats are holding on to their electoral map advantage, while Donald Trump has become the central issue and question on the ballot. 
Republicans look to be heading for a major ballot box disaster because voters do not believe that Donald Trump is fit to be president.",1
FBI Horrified As Spy Says Russia Has Been Supporting And Cultivating Trump For Years,"By Sarah Jones on Tue, Nov 1st, 2016 at 11:48 am A ""veteran"" spy is alleging that Russia is cultivating, supporting and assisting Donald Trump and has been for at least five years. The spy said the response from the FBI was ""shock and horror."" Share on Twitter Print This Post 
A “veteran” spy is alleging that Russia is cultivating, supporting and assisting Donald Trump and has been for at least five years. The spy said the response from the FBI was “shock and horror.” 
The report alleges that Trump and his “inner circle” have accepted a regular “flow of intelligence from the Kremlin and that Russian intelligence claims to have “compromised” Trump on his visits and could “blackmail him”. 
David Corn at Mother Jones reported: 
Mother Jones has reviewed that report and other memos this former spy wrote. The first memo, based on the former intelligence officer’s conversations with Russian sources, noted, “Russian regime has been cultivating, supporting and assisting TRUMP for at least 5 years. Aim, endorsed by PUTIN, has been to encourage splits and divisions in western alliance.” It maintained that Trump “and his inner circle have accepted a regular flow of intelligence from the Kremlin, including on his Democratic and other political rivals.” It claimed that Russian intelligence had “compromised” Trump during his visits to Moscow and could “blackmail him.” It also reported that Russian intelligence had compiled a dossier on Hillary Clinton based on “bugged conversations she had on various visits to Russia and intercepted phone calls.” 
The former intelligence officer says the response from the FBI was “shock and horror.” The FBI, after receiving the first memo, did not immediately request additional material, according to the former intelligence officer and his American associates. Yet in August, they say, the FBI asked him for all information in his possession and for him to explain how the material had been gathered and to identify his sources. The former spy forwarded to the bureau several memos—some of which referred to members of Trump’s inner circle. After that point, he continued to share information with the FBI. “It’s quite clear there was or is a pretty substantial inquiry going on,” he says. 
In August, Corn reports, the FBI asked the spy for all information related to his findings and he “continued to share information with the FBI” which he says made it clear there was a “pretty substantial inquiry going on.” 
If this report is accurate, the spy’s information confirms what Senator Harry Reid says intelligence experts and FBI Director James Comey already shared with him regarding “explosive information” regarding ties and coordination between Donald Trump and Russia. 
This report also rings true given report about the Trump server repeatedly being connected to Russia, including Trump’s server possibly communicating with a Russian bank. 
It also makes sense given the many ties to Russia within Trump’s own campaign and indeed Trump’s own rhetoric regarding NATO and Russia. Trump changed the Republican Party platform’s pro-Ukraine proposals and talked about weakening NATO, both of which mirrored Putin’s wish list. NBC reported Monday evening that the FBI is in the preliminary stages of investigating Trump’s ex-campaign manager’s connection to Russia. 
Donald Trump has already been busted for reading Russian propaganda at his rallies, as Newsweek’s Kurt Eichenwald uncovered an instance of Trump reading propaganda directly from Putin at a rally in Pennsylvania. 
Eichenwald pointed out something vital and that is that the Russians have been hacking into American emails and then falsifying them in hopes of impacting the presidential election, “The Russians have been obtaining American emails and now are presenting complete misrepresentations of them—falsifying them—in hopes of setting off a cascade of events that might change the outcome of the presidential election. The big question, of course, is why are the Russians working so hard to damage Clinton and, in the process, aid Donald Trump?” 
The answer to why Putin is trying so hard to defeat Clinton might be in multiple reports that he fears her. Unlike Donald Trump, Hillary Clinton is no pushover. According to former U.S. officials, Putin sees Clinton as a “forceful proponent of ‘regime change’ policies that the Russian leader considers a grave threat to his own survival.” 
Trump has been acting like someone already groomed by the Kremlin. He’s been a willing puppet for their dangerous goal of destroying western democracy, he is easily flattered and easily manipulated. It’s also easy to see how they could have gotten something on him with which to blackmail him – see the Billy Bush bus tape of Trump bragging about sexual assault. Trump is easy bait. 
The fact that the FBI Director felt compelled to announce something about Hillary’s emails that turned out to not be about her emails but about her aide’s emails and even then he wasn’t sure what they said or even if they were duplicates, but he chose to keep this explosive information about Donald Trump’s ties to Russia under wraps is very disturbing. 
This isn’t a matter of partisan disagreement about the rules the FBI follows about ongoing investigations. This is a matter of national security at this point if all of these reports from different sources are accurate. But the fact that they come from different sources and that Trump willingly staffed his own campaign with Russian ties and he is advocating for their dream positions and he reads their propaganda straight from the vault so to speak — these facts add up to what looks like a terrifying fire of epic proportions.",1
Comey Must Explain Why He Advised Obama Not to Publicly Accuse Russia of Hacking Democrats,"By Sarah Jones on Tue, Nov 1st, 2016 at 1:26 pm Comey struggled with not wanting to appear biased as the FBI investigated Russian interference with the U.S. presidential election, and so he told the Obama administration not to accuse Russia of the DNC hackings lest they be seen as ""partisan"". Share on Twitter Print This Post 
Russia did hack the Democrats. So all of that email information that the media has been reporting came from a foreign entity that seeks to alter the outcome of the U.S. election. 
But FBI Director James Comey struggled with not wanting to appear biased as the FBI investigated Russian interference with the U.S. presidential election, and so he told the Obama administration not to accuse Russia of the DNC hackings lest they be seen as “partisan”. 
Republican FBI Director James Comey advised the Obama administration not to publicly accuse Russia of hacking the DNC and more “on the grounds that it would make the administration appear unduly partisan too close to the Nov. 8 election,” officials “familiar with the deliberations” told the Washington Post. 
These sources with knowledge of the internal discussions spoke to the Post on the condition of anonymity. 
There are a few reasons why Comey might want to keep his agency’s investigation of Russian interference under the radar, but given his choice to publicly suggest that his agency might be re-opening its exhaustive investigation of Clinton’s emails, which resulted from a Republican-led, bogus, overreaching and seemingly endless Benghazi investigation that also cleared Clinton, it seems odd that Comey was going to stay silent on the Russia matter. 
Comey’s decisions is especially odd given the reports that the Russians have been communicating and coordinating with Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump to the point that he is already “compromised.” 
Only one of these matters might allow a foreign power control over the United States president. 
The same sources tell the Post that Comey made the decision to reveal the Clinton emails to Congress because he had already testified in that matter and said the investigation was closed, which suggests that he was concerned with his own reputation. 
Not sure I’m buying that because if Comey really only cared about his own reputation ahead of not appearing partisan he wouldn’t have said anything at all, but that doesn’t mean that his motives were nefarious. 
There might well be good reason for this – after all, this is the FBI and they can’t tell us everything, but as of right now Comey has mishandled this `and appears to be trying to influence an election to help Republicans. Just because he is a Republican and just because he has donated to Republicans doesn’t mean he isn’t doing his job properly. 
But Comey has a lot of explaining to do right now. He is under fire for good reason, as the explanations he’s giving for these decisions don’t make sense and are contradictory.",1
Comey Letter Hurts GOP As Hillary Clinton Raised $11.3 Million Online In 72 Hours,"The letter from James Comey about the Hillary Clinton email scandal has motivated Democrats, as the Clinton campaign says they raised $11.3 million online in the last 72 hours. 
Lisa Lerer of the AP reported: Clinton campaign says they've raised $11.3M online in last 72 hrs – the most $s since Clinton became nominee at the convention 
— Lisa Lerer (@llerer) November 1, 2016 
The Comey letter was supposed to boost Trump and depress Democratic turnout, but the opposite appears to be happening. James Comey’s interference in the presidential election has motivated Clinton supporters to work harder, give more money, and get to the polls, which in not what Republicans wanted at all. 
Democrats have seen through Comey’s letter and the Republican spin. The October surprise has failed. Instead, it has made Hillary Clinton even stronger while giving her campaign more resources to use to close out the presidential election. 
As a political tactic, the Comey letter is harming Republicans. 
Republicans have thrown everything that they can think of at Hillary Clinton, and nothing has stopped her. Hillary Clinton and her supporters continue to grow stronger, while Donald Trump is marching back into reality television star C-list celebrity obscurity.",1
Hillary Clinton Is Setting A Masterful Trap For Trump To Self Destruct,"While campaigning for Hillary Clinton in Florida, Alicia Machado described in detail the abuse inflicted on her by Donald Trump at the Miss Universe pageant.

Machado said, “I was scared of him. He made fun of me, and I didn’t know how to respond. He told me I was ugly. I was massive. He called me names. He called me Miss Piggy, Miss Housekeeping, Miss Eating Machine….For years, afterward, I was sick fighting back eating disorders.” 
Machado added, “It’s clear. It’s really clear that he does not respect women. He just judges us on our looks.” 
It is smart to take every opportunity to remind voters that as a human being, Donald Trump has consistently behaved in public like trash. He is a man who hates women and treats more than half of the population like objects. 
Having Machado introduce Clinton in Florida was also savvy politics. Trump has never demonstrated the personal restraint needed not to take the bait. Machado’s comments should cause Trump to blow up again, and throw his dire campaign even further off message. 
Hillary Clinton is setting Trump with a masterful trap. No one has been better at feeding negative Trump news cycles than the candidate himself. Trump can’t resist defending himself, and Hillary Clinton is setting the Republican nominee up to open his mouth and wallow in his own sexist mud.",1
370 Economists Sign Letter Urging America Not To Vote For Donald Trump,"By Jason Easley   5:03 pm 370 of nation's top economists have come together to urge the American people not to elect Donald Trump to be the next President Of The United States.   
370 of nation’s top economists have come together to urge the American people not to elect Donald Trump to be the next President Of The United States. 
In the letter , the economists listed a dozen economic policy reasons why voters should not vote for Trump, but it as their conclusion that was stunning, “He promotes magical thinking and conspiracy theories over sober assessments of feasible economic policy options.Donald Trump is a dangerous, destructive choice for the country. He misinforms the electorate, degrades trust in public institutions with conspiracy theories, and promotes willful delusion over engagement with reality. If elected, he poses a unique danger to the functioning of democratic and economic institutions, and to the prosperity of the country. For these reasons, we strongly recommend that you do not vote for Donald Trump.” 
Trump’s thoughts on the economy are dangerous to the prosperity of the country. It isn’t just that Trump is a person of bad character who lacks any of the human traits that voters should seek in a president. It is also that his policies are nonsense. 
Economists don’t write these types of letters ever. The economists aren’t discussing partisan politics. They view Trump and his ideas as a threat to the American economy. 
Donald Trump’s economic ideas aren’t based in reality. Trump is selling a fantasy, and when 370 of the nation’s top economists warn that a vote for Trump is a dangerous choice for the country, voters would be wise to listen.",1
David Bossie Desperately Claims Clinton Enthusiasm Gap is Trump Path to Victory,"By Hrafnkell Haraldsson   8:47 pm ""We're not conceding we're behind. In our enthusiasm, we have closed the gap...dramatically over the last week.""   
Donald Trump’s deputy campaign manager, the Clinton-obsessed Republican operative, David Bossie, told ABC News’ George Stephanopoulos this morning that “there’s an enthusiasm gap” and that this bit of math Republicans do is Trump’s path to victory on November 8. 
This is how the conversation went, per CBS News’ Sopan Deb , as always highlighting the important bits: 
Stephanopoulos was not about to let Bossie get away with the claim about Trump’s tax returns, and hammered him on the issue: ""He's going to release [his tax return] when he is not under audit.""– David Bossie, Trump Deputy Campaign Manager https://t.co/Y9xVg0rJIX 
— Good Morning America (@GMA) November 1, 2016 
Bossie deflected like a pro. You can see why Trump hired him. 
As a corollary to Bossie’s claims, Trump suddenly found himself interested in polls again this morning, tweeting , Wow, now leading in @ABC / @washingtonpost Poll 46 to 45. Gone up 12 points in two weeks, mostly before the Crooked Hillary blow-up! 
— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) November 1, 2016 
The Trump campaign has always been about making much out of nothing; elections are not rigged if Trump gets his way, and neither are polls if Trump is leading. Otherwise, it’s all left-wing shenanigans. 
However, even Newt Gingrich isn’t buying the new poll: Washington Post-ABC poll is an absurdity. Trump has not moved up 13 points in the last 8 days.he was NEVER 12 points behind. Ignore polls 
— Newt Gingrich (@newtgingrich) November 1, 2016 
And what Trump fails to mention is that his lead disappears if Johnson and Stein are taken out of the mix: then Clinton leads by +1 . 
These latest claims are an absolute sham as Clinton leads overwhelmingly in early voting and Comey’s email gambit seems to have failed to sway voters to Trump’s camp. 
Meanwhile, Trump’s own legal problems are beginning to overwhelm the narrative , and if there is any evidence of a Clinton enthusiasm gap it exists only in Bossie’s own head. 
David Bossie is living proof that Clinton’s “vast right-wing conspiracy is real,” and all the hating on Hillary isn’t going to change the fact that it is Trump who is the crooked candidate, not Hillary Clinton.",1
House Republicans Plan Secret Meeting To Discuss Overthrowing Paul Ryan,"By Jason Easley on Tue, Nov 1st, 2016 at 9:38 pm The more things change, the more they stay the same. The House Freedom Caucus is planning a secret meeting, which in typical Republican fashion was leaked to the press, to discuss ousting Paul Ryan and demanding more ransom from GOP leadership. Share on Twitter Print This Post 
The more things change, the more they stay the same. The House Freedom Caucus is planning a secret meeting, which in typical Republican fashion was leaked to the press, to discuss ousting Paul Ryan and demanding more ransom from GOP leadership. 
Politico reported , “One of the most pressing questions preoccupying Washington is what the group will do about Paul Ryan. The Wisconsin Republican has said he intends to seek another term as House speaker but has rankled members of the group of several dozen Republican lawmakers that drove John Boehner out of the Speakership last year. The Freedom Caucus is also weighing proposals meant to empower its members, some at the expense of GOP leadership’s authority.” 
There have been early rumblings that Speaker Ryan may be open to making a few deals on policies like tax reform with Hillary Clinton if she wins the election. One of the reasons why these deals may never happen is because of the ability of far right Republicans to cause trouble. 
If Ryan’s Republican majority shrinks, he will be an even bigger hostage to the far-right wing of his caucus. The dysfunctional dynamic in the House is going to continue even if Hillary Clinton wins the election. Ryan has run into the same hurdles that John Boehner faced. House Republicans are deeply divided and unable to agree on much of anything. 
The fact that the Freedom Caucus is holding a secret meeting is a sign that nothing is going to change. If Paul Ryan doesn’t cave to their demands, they will force Ryan out of the Speaker position. 
A group of House Republicans is plotting new ways to keep the House from working properly before a new president has even been elected. 
This is a reminder that Washington is fine. It’s the Republican Party that’s broken.",1
Sean Hannity Spreads Fake News Story To Millions As Republicans Remain Brainwashed,"By Jason Easley on Tue, Nov 1st, 2016 at 10:23 pm Republicans are so far removed from reality that Sean Hannity spread a fake news story on his radio show, and nobody noticed the difference. Share on Twitter Print This Post 
Republicans are so far removed from reality that Sean Hannity spread a fake news story on his radio show, and nobody noticed the difference. 
CNN reported, “The progression of events illustrates how fake news stories expand and spread from fringe web sites to nationally syndicated radio shows with millions of listeners. In this case, the fake news originated on a dubious site called “Your News Wire,” which publishes a mix of true, slanted and made-up news. Then, like a game of telephone, by the time the story got to Hannity, even the fake facts were wrong.” 
Some right-wing websites spread the story, which turned into a tall tale that added new details at each stop. The fake news eventually reached The Gateway Pundit, and to Sean Hannity’s radio show. 
After spreading the fake news to millions of listeners, Hannity downplayed his responsibility to get the facts right, “Bottom line it was brought up in an insignificant way, I was dealing with more important issues like HRC crimes and lies and how CNN has been colluding with the Clinton campaign and CHEATING Bernie Sanders.” 
Hannity was busy dealing with real fake issues like Hillary Clinton’s “crimes” and how the election is being stolen from Donald Trump. 
How Hannity put a fake story on the air is a perfect example of how the right-wing media echo chamber works. Nobody at any level bothered to check the facts because in the Republican Party belief has replaced fact. Conservative media knows that their audience wants confirmation of their beliefs, so that is what they provide. 
It doesn’t matter if the confirmation is true. What matters is that the audience wants it to be true. 
Sean Hannity is pushing fake news, and he doesn’t care. 
This is why there is such a disconnect between Republicans and the rest of the country. Republican voters are living in a fantasy land that Donald Trump was able to exploit and ride the whole way to the Republican nomination. 
The conservative media bubble is alive and well, and because of this, things will get a lot worse for Republicans before they begin to get better.",1
Donald Trump Begs Hillary Clinton Early Voters to Change Their Votes,"As a new poll shows 28% of early Republican Florida voters casting their vote for Clinton, Donald Trump is getting desperate. 
The Republican nominee begged Clinton voters to change their vote in 6 states where it’s not too late to do so. Trump wrote Wednesday morning, “So now that you can see Hillary was a big mistake, change your vote to MAKE AMERICAN GREAT AGAIN!” You can change your vote in six states. So, now that you see that Hillary was a big mistake, change your vote to MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN! 
— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) November 2, 2016 
Tuesday evening Trump made the case that due to the FBI’s announcement about Clinton’s emails voters might have buyers’ remorse , “A lot of things have happened over the last few days. This is a message for any Democratic voters who have already cast their ballots for Hillary Clinton and are having a bad case of buyers’ remorse — in other words you want to change your vote — Wisconsin is one of several states where you can change your early ballot if you think you’ve made a mistake.” 
While it’s true that people in some states can change their votes, it’s not true that this rule was changed because of Hillary Clinton’s “emails” and yes, that’s a new Right wing “thing” apparently. Trump doesn’t suggest the law was changed because of Clinton, but he seems to think people will be rushing to change their mind about Clinton because of the non-surprise October “surprise!” the Republican FBI Director delivered , which was perceived to have benefited the Trump ticket. 
Days ago, Snopes debunked the notion that changing early votes is being allowed because of the FBI’s bizarre announcement that they may or may not have more emails pertaining to Clinton. 
Claim: After FBI Director Jim Comey announced that he was reviewing e-mails potentially linked to Hillary Clinton, several states announced that they were allowing people to change their early votes. mixture 
WHAT’S TRUE: Some states allow early voters to change their votes before election day. 
WHAT’S FALSE: No states changed their election laws in order to allow people who voted early for Hillary Clinton to change their votes. 
And to make this even better, that false information was based on a Fox News report that wasn’t selling the false story about Clinton, but still got some of the information wrong. This is why the Right can’t have nice things. The Left should be vigilant against allowing itself to become too insular, because epistemic closure leads to losing. 
Trump conveniently ignores his own history of email dumping, exhaustive list of lawsuits, bragging about sexual assault, dissing minorities and a Gold Star family, and national security experts investigating his ties and his campaign’s ties to Russia. 
Only a desperate candidate runs on trying to get people to change their votes to him because someone found a Clinton aide’s emails when they don’t even know what they say or if they are duplicates yet. 
While this race is far from over, if all Americans get off their butts and go vote, Donald Trump faces an uphill battle to the White House.",1
Hillary Clinton Shuts Down Protester and Trump’s ‘Divisive Vision’ at Florida Rally,"By Hrafnkell Haraldsson on Wed, Nov 2nd, 2016 at 9:02 am “You know, I am sick and tired of the negative, dark, divisive, dangerous vision and behavior from people who support Donald Trump."" Share on Twitter Print This Post 
Speaking at Reverend Samuel Delevoe Memorial Park in Fort Lauderdale, Tuesday night, Hillary Clinton was interrupted by a Donald Trump supporter who shouted: “Bill Clinton is a rapist!” He was no doubt working for the $5,000 reward offered by InfoWars. But Clinton was having none of it. Rather than ignoring the man, she issued a stern rebuke. Stabbing her finger at the man, she said: 
“You know, I am sick and tired of the negative, dark, divisive, dangerous vision and behavior from people who support Donald Trump.” 
The man continued to shout, waving his sign, and the crowd countered with cries of “Hillary! Hillary!” as she said, 
“It is time for us to say no, we are not going backwards, we’re going forward into a brighter future.” 
The protester was escorted out by security, and Clinton told the man, and everyone like him, “You may be angry about something, but anger is not a plan. Don’t be used. Don’t be exploited.” 
See the protester’s antics here. Note that he was neither roughed up nor attacked by Clinton supporters: 
Sadly, all too many angry white Christians are allowing themselves to be exploited by Donald Trump, who represents the very forces that have deprived them of the American dream, a man whom, as Clinton says, has taken everything, and given nothing. 
Last night, in Florida, Hillary Clinton was taking nothing, and giving everything.

Um destruidor de democracias e pilhador de nações,"Um destruidor de democracias e pilhador de nações 27.10.2016 A midiotização pelo mundo afora, leva o povo a acreditar que governos não simpáticos aos EUA, são governos ditatoriais, mesmo que tenham sido eleitos pelo voto dos seus concidadãos, como o caso de Assad na Síria e Maduro na Venezuela. Valter Xéu* Na época do George Bush, a mídia e os serviços de inteligências do ocidente propagaram para o mundo de que países como o Irã, Iraque e Coreia do Norte formavam o Eixo do Mal que colocava o mundo em perigo e a propaganda dizia: 'Ou você está conosco, outra contra nós'. Todos os países que não são simpáticos ou que contrarie os interesses dos Estados Unidos, a forte propaganda de manipulação trata de disseminar pelo mundo de que aquele governante é um ditador. E assim é feito com a Síria, onde apesar de Assad ter vencido duas ou três eleições presidenciais, recebeu o carimbo de ditador pelo simples fato de contrariar os interesses dos Estados Unidos e ter sido eleito, a propaganda dissemina pelo mundo de que foi uma eleição fraudulenta e isso o ocidental não aceita como aceitou o resultado da eleição em que Bush venceu Al Gore. Enviar para um amigo Os Estados Unidos destruíram o Iraque com a propaganda de que o país possuía armas de destruição em massa o que não era verdadeiro e isso foi atestado pelas próprias forças de ocupação. Como a mentira já não colava nos quatro cantos do mundo e inventaram de que estavam levando a democracia a um pais governado pelo ditador Saddam Hussein e que até​ então, tinha sido aliado dos americanos. Hoje os iraquianos vivem em situação muito pior, com conflitos de toda natureza onde os grupos diversos recebem armas do ocidente para guerrearem entre si enquanto as Hal​l​iburton da vida segue tranquila roubando o seu petróleo. ​ Halliburton foi administrada pelo ex-vice-presidente americano Dick Cheney: Tutti cosa nostra... A mesma coisa aconteceu com a Líbia que depois de Israel era o segundo IDH do Oriente Médio segundo a ONU. Mesmo assim, precisaram formar uma coalizão internacional de 46 países para derrubar e assassinar Khadaffi. E usando o pretexto de que estavam derrubando um ditador, destruíram o pai​s, onde grupos rivais armados pelo ocidente se matam e as Halliburton Depois do Afeganistão, Iraque e Líbia chegou à vez da Síria onde os norte americanos acreditavam que seria muito mais fácil e ai houve o engano, pois Assad resistiu e de imediato trataram de disseminar pelo mundo de que ali era mais um ditador e como midiotizado é uma praga que existe em todo o planeta, Assad passou a ser demonizado pelo simples fato de ter enfrentado as forças criadas pelos Estados Unidos, Reino Unido, França, Alemanha, Arábia Saudita, Qatar, Turquia (que parece esta mudando de lado depois do tal golpe em que acusam os norte americanos) e a cumplicidade de Israel que oferece ajuda mé​dica e vez por outra derruba aviões da força aérea da Síria que ousa bombardear as forças do Estado Islâmico nas imediações das Colinas de Golan. Com a chegada dos russos as coisas mudaram de um Assad quase derrotado para um presidente mais forte no poder. Os russos lá estão com a anuência do presidente sírio enquanto as forças ocidentais que não tiveram autorização são meras invasoras. E isso fere a carta da ONU e a soberania Síria, mas a ONU não vale nada para as potências​ do ocidente, onde na sua maioria participam da força agressora que é a OTAN = Organização Terrorista do Atlântico Norte e que no final dos anos 80 bombardeou Belgrado capital da Iugoslávia em pleno coração da Europa, mas como diz um amigo Croata, ""naquela época não existia o Putin"". Na questão de Aleppo, vários grupos terroristas estão no domínio da cidade perpetrando toda desgraça sobre a população, usando armas químicas, mas o culpado é Assad que ousou enfrentá-los. Na Venezuela, apesar de Chávez e Maduro terem sido eleitos pelo voto da maioria da população, a mídia e o atual governo golpista do Brasil, Argentina e Paraguai trata os governantes venezuelanos como ditadores o que parece até​ piada. O de lá eleito pelo voto direto é ditador. O golpista do Brasil, o ​que é? Na Venezuela depois do fracassado golpe com armas em que Chávez foi preso e voltou nos braços do povo, à direita e seus apoiadores internacionais mudaram de tática e usaram a mesma que destronou o governo ucraniano, defenestrado com denuncias de corrupção e hoje uma quadrilha de corruptos estão no poder com a ajuda do ""campeão da democracia"". Usaram desse expediente aqui e estão usando o mesmo na Venezuela onde de repente desapareceram dos supermercados os gêneros alimentícios ​​sabotados pela burguesia empresarial. ​ O governo criou uma espécie de Cesta do Povo o que se mostrou ineficaz contra o desabastecimento e assim os grandes grupos econômicos com ajuda externa que despejam bilhões de dólares para acumpliciar mídia e uma parte dos parlamentares. Com o judiciário a coisa é bem diferente do que é o daqui. Maduro que não tem um perfil Dilma Rousseff e nem na sua equipe republicanos covardes, reage às provocações e recebe o carimbo de ditador pela sua ousadia em resistir. O pior de tudo isso, é que a midiotização geral leva a ""boiada"" a acreditar que realmente ele é um ditador, enquanto o nosso aqui é um democrata e que aquele pais destruidor de países, é nada mais, nada menos que o verdadeiro campeão da democracia no mundo e a ""boiada"" acredita. Ô, raça! Em tempo Lula precisa fazer o mesmo que Maduro faz na Venezuela, Rafael Correa no Equador, Evo Morales na Bolívia e o que diz o escritor Mo​niz Bandeira, que é o envolvimento dos Estados Unidos em toda essa tram​a em que participa a mídia, o congresso e o judiciário e denunciar isso para o mundo, pois existe um interessado maior no enfraquecimento do país e esse interessado, o mundo sabe quem é. Isso é o que tem de ser feito. *Valter Xéu é diretor e editor dos portais Pátria Latina e Irã News. analista politico do Palestina Liberation, Pravda e diversas publicações no Brasil e exterior.",1

Дмитрий Савельев: Наказание для посягнувших на россиян должно быть неотвратимым,"0 комментариев 0 поделились 
23 октября в Нижнем Новгороде прошла операция, в ходе которой были застрелены двое подозреваемых в терроризме, еще один был задержан. По данным СМИ, в машине предполагаемых преступников была найдена взрывчатка. Ответственность за подготовка теракта взяло на себя ""Исламское государство"" (запрещено в России). 
""Международный терроризм превратился в реальную угрозу для всего мира. И конечно для России. И игнорировать эту угрозу недопустимо. Несколько дней назад в Нижнем Новгороде сотрудники спецслужб в ходе задержания ликвидировали в результате совершенного на них нападения двоих вооружённых боевиков. Преступление, совершенное в Нижнем Новгороде, ответственность за которое взяла на себя ИГИЛ, стало очередной попыткой международного терроризма дестабилизировать ситуацию в России"", - говорится в комментарии Дмитрия Савельева, поступившем в редакцию Pravda.Ru. 
""В августе террористы разместили в интернете призыв начать «священную войну» против России. Вскоре после этой угрозы двое боевиков напали в Подмосковье на пост ДПС, а в Казани был арестован сторонник ИГИЛ, планировавший взрыв на одном из заводов города. Всё это - хроника жёсткой реальности сегодняшнего дня"", - полагает политик. 
""Однако факты говорят сами за себя - российские спецслужбы оперативно пресекают деятельность террористов, великолепно справляясь с необходимостью удержать ситуацию под контролем"", - отметил депутат. 
""Но очень важно понимать - сегодня всем необходимо мобилизоваться и сплотиться перед лицом общей угрозы. Граждане страны обязательно должны проявлять бдительность, чтобы российская земля горела под ногами преступников. А задача Государственной Думы - обеспечить соответствие законодательства имеющимся вызовам. На мой взгляд, необходимо поощрить гражданскую инициативу по информированию спецслужб о готовящемся преступлении, надо, чтобы вознаграждение проинформировавшему лицу было предусмотрено законом. И главное - это добиться того, чтобы каждый, кто пытается посягнуть на покой россиян, сознавал неотвратимость наказания за это"", - подчеркнул Дмитрий Савельев. Поделиться:",1
У генпрокурора Украины нашли дорогую квартиру в Ялте,"0 комментариев 32 поделились 
""Скандал разгорелся в середине сентября, когда издание ""Наши гроши"" обнаружило целое жилое здание (семь квартир и одно нежилое помещение) в центре Киева на улице Эспланадной, которым владела гражданка по фамилии Светлана Рыженко"", — написал Лещенко в своем блоге на сайте ""Украинской правды"" . 
Она оказалась бухгалтером в фирме Ирины Луценко. 
Затем все у того же сельского бухгалтера обнаружилась еще одна недвижимость — квартира в Ялте общей площадью в 145 метров, которую все местные так и называют ""квартирой Луценко"".Ее не так давно выставили на продажу за 1 миллион долларов, отметил Лещенко. 
""Однако, кроме дома в Киеве, у бухгалтера Луценко из села оказалась еще одна недвижимость — в Крыму. Это квартира вЯлте площадью 145 метров, которая недавно была выставлена на продажу за 1 млн долларов"", — отметил Лещенко. 
""Другими словами, Луценко, всю жизнь работавший на госслужбе, оформил на подставных лиц огромных размеров дорогостоящую недвижимость, не имея подтвержденных для этого легальных доходов"", — заявил Лещенко. 
По словам депутата, Луценко продал недвижимость в Киеве депутату от Блока Порошенко Глебу Загорию после развязавшегося скандала. 
Напомним, как сообщала Правда. Ру, генпрокурором Украины Юрий Луценко стал в мае 2016 года, сменив на этом посту ставшего неугодным экс-генпрокурора Виктора Шокина, на отставке которого настаивали американские кураторы украинской власти. 
Представил к назначению Луценко лично Петр Порошенко . При этом президенту Украины даже пришлось внести некоторые законодательные изменения: Порошенко подписал закон о Генпрокуратуре, согласно которому ведомство может возглавить человек без юридического образования. В том, что эти изменения писались исключительно под кандидатуру нового генпрокурора, сомневаться не приходится. 
Несмотря на то, что Луценко не имеет профильного образования, он целых два раза успел возглавить МВД Украины. Есть в его биографии и другие ""полезные"" для занимаемой должности факты. К примеру, в 2010 году Луценко был арестован, а через два года — и осужден на 4 года по делу о растрате государственных средств в особо крупных размерах. В 2013 году Виктор Янукович своим президентским указом помиловал ряд осужденных, среди которых оказался и Луценко. 
Спустя еще год в судебном порядке с будущего генпрокурора были сняты все обвинения, а сам он признан ""политически пострадавшим"" от репрессий прежнего руководства страны.

Американский генерал признал проблемы со штурмом Мосула,"1 комментариев 4 поделились Фото: AP 
""Пока еще полного окружения Мосула нет. Но это и не обязательно, чтобы проводить наступление на город, чтобы его освободить от ИГ. У неприятеля есть пути входа и выхода, он ведет некоторую передислокацию бойцов, хотя мы не видим, что в город приходят или уходят из него большие подразделения"", - сказал Таунсенд на брифинге. 
При этом генерал вынужден был признать, что именно таким образом боевики, засевшие в Мосуле,получают и подкрепление, и боеприпасы. Более того, таким образом лидеры террористов имеют возможность покинуть город безнаказанными. 
Конечно, силы коалиции наносят по ним удары, но только тогда, когда видят самих боевиков или имеют точную о них информацию. Правда, наученные предыдущим опытом боев с коалицией, теперь боевики все это делают максимально скрытно: не передвигаются по местности под развевающимися флагами и в открытых автомобилях. 
Помимо этого, боевики прибегают к новой тактике маскировки: для того, чтобы смешаться с гражданским населением, некоторые из них просто сбривают бороды и переодеваются в другую одежду. Об этом рассказали жители Мосула. 
США и их союзники с 2014 года проводят в Ираке и Сирии операцию против ИГ. В ночь на 17 октября премьер-министр Ирака Хайдер аль-Абади заявил о начале военной операции по освобождению Мосула от боевиков ИГ. Иракские военные и силы полиции, а также курдские формирования при поддержке авиации коалиции во главе с США начали массированное наступление на город. 
Однако это наступление может обернуться катастрофой на Ближнем Востоке. Об этом заявил, к примеру, кандидат в президенты США Дональд Трамп. Или вот мнение отставного полковника США Дэниэла Дэвиса, которое он изложил в статье, опубликованной в The National Interest : Америке и силам коалиции стоит поторопиться с проведением операции в Мосуле, в противном случае террористы могут разорвать этот альянс в клочья. 
""Чем дольше продержится ИГ и чем больший урон нанесет коалиции, тем более вероятно, что религиозные и политические различия между освободительными силами будут проявляться все сильнее"", - пишет Дэвис. 
Прокомментировать ситуацию Pravda.Ru попросила военного эксперта Бориса Подопригору. 
В последние несколько месяцев официального пребывания американского президента в Белом доме, им захотелось организовать такой политический спектакль на тему американской приверженности в борьбе с терроризмом. Я так это вижу. 
Что из этого получится, мне сказать сложно. Самое плохое, что я ожидаю, это новое столкновение по линии сунниты-шииты. Вот в чем самая большая проблема. 
Если начнется резня, а такое исключать нельзя, то мало никому не покажется, хотя бы потому, что и Иран, и Саудовская Аравия в стороне от этого конфликта не будут. Можно лишь пожалеть, что в американском практическом востоковедении немного людей, которые задумываются о последствиях межрелигиозного столкновения.

России приказали трепетать перед венгерскими героями,"Мир » Европа » Евросоюз Российскому послу в Будапеште объяснили, что Венгрия не потерпит оскорбительных разговоров в государственных российских СМИ о венгерской революции и ее героях. Венгрия против того, чтобы события 1956 года назывались ""погромами"" и ""цветной революцией"". Есть ли повод оскорбляться? И стоит ли нам трепетно относиться к венгерским героям? 1 комментариев 14 поделились Что для венгров значат события 1956 года 
Для венгров события 1956 года — это народная антикоммунистическая революция , а не происки ЦРУ, организовавшего ""цветную революцию"". И это прерванный полет новой демократии руками ""кровавых гебистов"" из СССР. Вторая мысль в Венгрии не нуждается в доказательствах, а в доказательство первой цитируется американский историк Тим Вейнер и его книга ""ЦРУ. Правдивая история"". Там утверждается, что у Аллена Даллеса был в 50-х годах только один человек в Венгрии — некто Геза Катона, ""американец с венгерскими корнями, который 95 процентов своего времени работал мелким клерком в государственном департаменте, отправляя письма по почте, покупая марки и канцелярские товары, подшивая документы"". Тим Вейнер пишет, что события в Венгрии произошли спонтанно, а когда восставшие обратились за помощью, американцы оружием помочь не решились, а информационная поддержка ничего не дала. 
Вывод: для венгров ""революция"" 1956 года — это основа их государственности, доказательство исключительности венгерского народа, отличающегося от всех других честностью, справедливостью, свободолюбием, ну и т.д. На это у автора настоящей статьи есть один вопрос: как же этот свободолюбивый народ допустил фашистскую диктатуру и вместе с Гитлером вторгся в СССР, где отличился особыми зверствами? А вот для Запада венгерская история - это некая пропагандистская тряпка, которой там машут всякий раз, когда надо доказать, что коммунизму сопротивлялись по идейным соображениям, а не при поддержке США. Историческая правда — в чем она? 
Для нас же важно ответить на два вопроса. Что или кого советские войска подавляли в 1956 году и правильно ли это делалось? Напомним, что Венгрия была самым верным союзником Гитлера. Она объявила войну СССР 27 июня 1941 года и воевала практически до конца с общей численностью солдат до 205 тысяч человек. Венгры участвовали в многочисленных карательных операциях. Они крайне жестоко обращались с советскими военнопленными. После зверств, которые учинили венгры на Украине и особенно в Воронеже, Сталин приказал: ""Мадьяр в плен не брать!"" На территории Венгрии в период наступления Красной армии венгры вырезали всех раненых красноармейцев и медсестер из медсанбата, располагавшегося в городе Секешфехерваре. Таким образом для СССР Венгрия 1956 года была страной-агрессором, в которой любой бунт должен караться быстро и жестко. И, судя по тем зверствам, которые творили поборники новой ""демократии"" в 1956 году, опасения, что этот мятеж был фашистским, были вполне оправданы. 
Теперь давайте представим, как бы отреагировал Вашингтон, если бы японцы в 1956 году вышли бы на улицы Токио и стали бы громить американские представительства, вешать пособников оккупантов, глумиться над американским флагом? Нет сомнений, что с Окинавы тут же были бы направлены войска, которые быстро бы успокоили такую ""революцию"". И сегодня, по Уставу ООН, Германия и Япония обязаны не быть ""агрессивными"", иначе их вернут в состояние оккупационных зон. Венгрия в 50-х годах тоже не имела права быть агрессивной. И американцы хорошо это понимали, поэтому и не вмешивались. Иначе началась бы третья мировая война. В Венгрии 1956 года, Чехословакии 1968 года и т.д. СССР удерживал не коммунистические режимы, а геополитическое равновесие. И когда оно было утеряно, мы сейчас имеем то, что имеем. Вашингтон готовил переворот в Венгрии 
Во-вторых, есть факты, что подготовкой переворота в Венгрии занимался Вашингтон. Так, в январе 1956 года американской военной разведкой был подготовлен доклад ""Венгрия: активность и потенциал сопротивления"" (Hungary: Resistance Activities and Potentials). В докладе отмечались антиславянские и антисемитские чувства определенных групп населения, их симпатии к фашистской Германии, обеспечившей в 1943-1941 годы территориальные выгоды для Венгрии. Все это, по мнению американских разведчиков, облегчало ""перевод недовольства в фазу активного сопротивления"". Страна включалась в реестр ""специальных сил"" для противодействия коммунизму. Летом 1956 года конгресс США в дополнение к 100 миллионам долларов, ассигнуемых каждый год на ведение подрывной работы против социалистических стран, выделил еще 25 миллионов. 
Американские газеты тогда сообщали, что эти средства предназначены для ""финансирования действий, аналогичных тем, которые привели к беспорядкам в Польше"". Осенью 1956 года бывший генерал хортистской армии Хуго Шонья заявил о наличии боеготового корпуса в составе 11 тысяч бойцов, способного начать действия в Венгрии. Американские военные пообещали ему помощь в переброске и снабжении. Тот же Вейнер пишет, что беженцы, приходившие в посольство, обращались к американцам: ""Почему нам никто не помог? Разве вы не знали, что венгры рассчитывают на вашу помощь?"" Разве можно так спрашивать, не имея на это оснований? Герои Венгрии — кто они? 
В заключение посмотрим, кто ходит в Венгрии в героях? В июле 2011 года суд Будапешта признал 97-летнего военного преступника Шандора Кепиро невиновным в пособничестве нацистам и массовых убийствах во время Второй мировой войны. Кепиро обвинялся в причастности к убийству 1200 евреев, сербов и цыган в оккупированном сербском городе Нови-Сад в 1942 году, был надсмотрщиком в Освенциме. После войны Кепиро бежал в Австрию, затем в Аргентину, где скрывался почти 50 лет. Когда Венгрия ""сбросила оковы коммунизма"", Кепиро вернулся в Будапешт и поселился в доме, находящемся напротив самой крупной в Европе синагоги. 
Или, например, мало кому известно, что пять лет назад премьер Орбан наградил орденом ""за заслуги"" живущего в Лондоне советского диссидента Владимира Буковского. 
И если бы российский МИД обращал внимание на то, что пишут венгерские СМИ о нашей Победе и ее героях, ""то ваш посол в Москве давно бы стоптал ботинки"", сказал Дмитрий Киселев в ответ на венгерские претензии. Кстати, почему бы не обратить внимание? Венгрия приглашает Грузию в Альянс",1
"""Надеюсь, инициаторы создания памятника Петлюре об этом пожалеют""","3 комментариев 16 поделились Фото: AP 
Напомним, Симон Петлюра с декабря 1918 по апрель 1919 года руководил в Киеве так называемой Директорией, а также был командующим войсками. Петлюру изгнала из города Красная армия, а в 1921 году он бежал за границу. Его правление было отмечено разгулом бандитизма и беззаконием. В 1926 году был убит в Париже Самуилом Шварцбурдом, отомстившим за родственников, погибших во время петлюровского погрома. Шварцбурд был оправдан французским судом присяжных. 
Своим впечатлением от решения украинских властей с Pravda.Ru поделился президент Российского еврейского конгресса Юрий Каннер. 
- Петлюра известен своей жестокостью, он причастен к еврейским погромам, в которых было убито, по разным оценкам, от 50 до 200 тысяч человек. Конечно, это не дело России, но на Украине тоже живут евреи, и им такое едва ли понравится. 
- По сути, Петлюра становится мифическим персонажем. Если посмотреть шире, то вновь созданным государствам это свойственно: они сами формируют свою историю. У нас в России тоже ставят спорные памятники, правда, некоторые из них потом убирают. Но вообще это стало очень популярным на постсоветском пространстве. 
Конечно, это попытка расколоть общество, и кому-то это очень нужно. Если вы спрашиваете у меня, то я вам отвечу: еврейскую общественность особенно волнует это вытаскивание ""старых скелетов"". 
Мой прадед Давид Каннер, который был раввином, убит при погроме в городе Чернобыле. Тогда много людей - мужчин, в основном раввинов, глав общин и городов, погрузил на баржу и утопили в Припяти. Правда, это не были не петлюровцы, это была вообще какая-то другая банда. Но это не меняет ситуации, потому что пройдет какое-то время, и этим бандитам тоже могут поставить памятник. 
- Может быть стоит выступить международным правозащитным организациям со своим мнением? 
- Я думаю, что выразить свое мнение по этому поводу нужно. В Москве 1-2 ноября мы проводим первую международную конференцию по противодействию антисемитизму . У нас будет очень много выступающих. Может быть, кто-то этот вопрос и затронет. К нам на конференцию прибудет президент Всемирного еврейского конгресса господин (Рональд) Лаудер, будет и много других известных людей, экспертов, из почти 20-ти государств, а также израильский министр безопасности. 
Так что это открытие памятника Петлюре может стать одной из тем обсуждения. Хотя в основном мы будем обсуждать российские проблемы, я думаю, найдутся люди, которые поднимут и смежные вопросы. 
Конечно, эта новость нельзя назвать приятной для евреев - выходцев с Украины. Я ведь тоже там родился во времена Советского Союза. Однако я надеюсь, что у инициаторов такого увековечивания памяти Петлюры будет потом время пожалеть о том, что они сейчас делают.

Заметят ли в России отмену рыбного эмбарго?,"Экономика Постановлением правительства России расширены исключения из списка санкционной продукции. В документе, опубликованным 25 октября на официальном интернет-портале правовой информации, в частности, говорится о том, что теперь в Россию разрешено ввозить мальков камбалы-тюрбо, лаврака обыкновенного и молоди белоногой креветки, а также мальков лосося атлантического, форели и молоди мидий. 0 комментариев 0 поделились Фото: AP 
Напомним, ограничения на импорт продовольствия из стран Евросоюза, США, Норвегии, Австралии и Канады вступило в силу в августе 2014 года. Запрет коснулся не только поставок говядины, мяса птицы, свинины, орехов, фруктов и овощей из этих стран, но и рыбы. 
Некоторые из опрошенных Pravda.ru рыботорговцев, впрочем, признавались, что запрещенная к ввозу деликатесная рыба все равно импортировалась в Россию из Чили, Уругвая, Китая. 
Прокомментировать решение кабинета министров Pravda.Ru попросила президента Всероссийской ассоциации рыбохозяйственных предприятий, предпринимателей и экспортеров (ВАРПЭ) Александра Фомина. 
- Как вы оцениваете постановление правительства, исключившего из списка эмбарго ряд наименований рыбы? И дело касается только мальков? 
- Как я понял, правительство сняло запрет на ввоз мальков по нескольким позициям. Как известно, своих посадочного материала, своих мальков у нас нет, и видимо кто-то, решив выращивать этих мальков, обратился в правительство. Соответственно, правительство приняло нужное решение и исключило эти позиции из санкционного списка. 
- Сейчас, кажется, только форель сами разводят в России? 
- Форель тоже разная. Есть форель как бы морская, которая в садках по норвежским технологиям выращивается, вот таких мальков у нас нет. Зато неплохо обстоят дела с разведением пресноводной форели , здесь своих мальков хватает. Ну и плюс там раки, какие-то креветки, этого тоже у нас просто нет. 
С мидиями проще: мальки мидий у нас есть, но видимо предприниматели хотят завозить какой-то особый вид моллюсков, там личинки. Среди посадочного материала устриц есть интересные экземпляры - двустворки, они интересны тем, что более продуктивны. Вот таких у нас устриц нет, наши все больше ""дикие"". 
- Почему же у нас нет своих мальков? 
- Откровенно говоря, у нас и хозяйств таких еще нет. Я предполагаю, что кто-то решил создать такие бизнес-проекты, связанные с разведением этих видов рыб. А раньше мы этим никогда и не занимались , поэтому нет и мальков. 
- Это хорошо, что сами будем разводить? 
- Конечно, разводить свою рыбу надо. Но быстрых результатов ждать не приходится: чтобы получить собственных мальков, нужно работать над этим 5-10 лет. Однако, если мы начнем покупать мальков, выращивать их до взрослой рыбы, тогда этот процесс пойдет быстрее. 
- Видимо, пока еще не стоит говорить о том, что цены на рыбу станут ниже? 
- Ну, это в общем очень маленькая ниша. Пока рыбу вырастят, пройдет 2-3 года. И все равно это продукция премиум-сегмента, которые обычные жители даже не заметят, не услышат об этом ничего. Это продукты для ресторанов. Камбала тюрбо, допустим, это очень дорогая рыба. Форель тоже малодоступная. Поэтому, основная масса населения этого даже не почувствует. 
- Получается, что-то решил производить именно элитные деликатесы? 
- Да, вероятно у кого-то возникла именно такая идея. Другой вопрос, что по более серьезным позициям запреты не снимают, а по несерьезным - буквально по щелчку пальцев вопрос решился, и это странно.

В России ни в одной республике понятие ""коренные народы"" как права и нормы не присутствуют. Я думаю, что это юридический правовой казус, с которым наши юристы способны спокойно разобраться. 
Кстати, в государственной национальной политике термин коренные и не коренные народы также не используется. Это была согласованная позиция, в том числе всех субъектов Федерации, в обсуждении стратегии принимала участие и Якутия. 
Отметим, постановление Конституционного суда Якутии, прописывающее ""коренное"" право только за якутами, противоречит пункту 1 44-й статьи Конституции Республики Саха (Якутия), гласящему, что ""территория Республики принадлежит ее многонациональному народу"". Оно также входит в противоречие со статьей 46 Конституции, где указано, что русский язык является на территории государственным, наряду с саха (якутским). 
Как сообщает eadaily. com, данное постановление также противоречит с целым блоком Конституции республики, где прописаны права, свободы и обязанности человека и гражданина на территории Республики Саха (Якутия). Разумеется, правовое разделение жителей Якутии на ""коренных"" и ""некоренных"", при котором у одних есть четко сформулированные жизненно важные права, а у других такого нет — это нарушение законов Российской Федерации, Конституции России и международного законодательства о правах и свободах человека и гражданина.

Президент России сообщил о сроках энергообеспечения Крыма,"0 комментариев 0 поделились Фото: AP 
""В конце этого года в Крым должна прийти магистральная газовая труба. И с этого момента начнется настоящая, полноценная газификация и электроснабжение уже от собственной генерации: первичный источник — газ. Мы планируем и уже осуществляем строительство электростанции на газе"", — сказал Путин, выступая на организованным ОНФ ""Форуме действий. Крым"" в Ялте. По его словам, ""с этого момента начнется действительно реальная газификация и энергообеспечение всего полуострова, включая Севастополь"". 
Российский лидер также напомнил о том, как прошедшей зимой с Украины на полуостров прекратили поставлять электроэнергию. По его мнению, это было ""преступление против человека"": ""Что касается прекращения подачи воды или вот эта ситуация, связанная с прекращением подачи электроэнергии, — это, конечно, на грани преступления против человека. Взять крупный регион, в котором несколько миллионов человек проживают, и отключить от электроснабжения зимой — это, знаете, очень серьезная вещь"", — сказал глава государства. 
Он подчеркнул, что не понимает, на что рассчитывали те люди, которые отключили энергоснабжение в Крым. 
""Думали, что все встанут на колени и будут просить подачку? Удивительные идиоты"", - сказал Путин. 
Недоумение вызывает и поведение международных правозащитный организаций, которые никак не выразили своего отношения к создавшейся тогда вопиющей ситуации, сказал Владимир Путин. 
""У нас правозащитные организации чего-то воды в рот набрали, язык проглотили и молчат. А на самом деле это же серьезное преступление. А больницы? А дети? А старики? Все молчат, как будто так и надо. Но бог с ними, в конце концов"", — посетовал президент. 
Для исключения подобной ситуации, а именно — обесточивания полуострова, в будущем до конца текущего года в Крым будет проложен магистральный газопровод. 
Кроме того, как рассказывала Правда. Ру, в своем выступлении на форуме ОНФ в Ялте глава государства коснулся и ряда других вопросов. В частности, как заявил президент, до 2020 года Россия потратит более 40 миллиардов рублей на обеспечение Крыма пресной водой. 
""Мы направили на решение этой задачи из федерального бюджета 23 с лишним миллиарда рублей. С 2015 по 2020 г. планируется в федеральной целевой программе по развитию Крыма и Севастополя еще свыше 40 млрд руб."", — сказал Путин. Он также добавил, что эти деньги необходимо израсходовать рационально. ""Федеральные и региональные органы власти эту проблему должны решить и обязательно решат, у меня в этом сомнений нет никаких"". 
Президент также напомнил, что на первых порах проблема с пресной водой на полуострове стояла ""очень остро, особенно после того как наши соседи отключили Крым от Северо-Крымского"".

При этом глава государства подчеркнул, что процесс сложный, существует много вопросов и мелких проблем.""Это достаточно сложный оказался процесс притирки. Нам местные коллеги говорят — мы сами сделаем то-то и то-то, им говорят — вам сложно будет, нет сами. Я говорю: ладно, не трогайте — пусть сами. Вот, Сергей Валерьевич (Аксенов — прим.) не даст соврать — не получается. Не потому что люди глупые или безрукие, совсем не это, а дело в том, что они же не знают, как устроены права и система России"", — сказал Владимир Путин. 
По словам главы государства, просто только на первый взгляд. ""Федеральные начинают пытаться здесь что-то сами делать, значит, они местных условий не знают — это тоже правда. Поэтому вот этот вопрос вхождения, а я об этом сказал, в правовое поле, административное поле России — это оказалось процессом не таким простым, но реально основные вещи мы уже практически преодолели"", — отметил президент. 
Глава государства также призвал активистов ОНФ продолжать мониторинг расходования бюджетных средств. Так он отреагировал на замечание одного из участников форума о том, что за счет средств выделенных на реконструкцию крупного спортивного объекта, можно построить 2,5 тысячи спортивных площадок для развития массового спорта. ""У меня есть встречное предложение. Давайте не будем пересматривать программу, а просто добавим вам денег на эти площадки"", — сказал Путин. 
""Только это нужно сделать таким образом, чтобы средства пошли именно на строительство площадок"", — добавил президент. И призвал активистов ОНФ убедиться, что бюджетные средства пошли именно на те цели, на которые выделяются. 
""Форум действий. Крым"" стал третьим из аналогичных мероприятий, которые в 2016 году проводил Общероссийский народный фронт. Первый ""Форум действий"" прошел в январе в Ставрополе, второй — в Йошкар-Оле в апреле. В крымском форуме приняли участие более 350 человек — активисты ОНФ, федеральные и региональные эксперты Народного фронта, представители исполнительной власти и журналисты.

В данный момент сделано очень многое, но сама проблема осталась, подчеркнул глава государства. 
Отметим, что кроме прочего, Владимир Путин призвал активистов ОНФ продолжать мониторинг расходования бюджетных средств. 
Один из участников пленарного заседания форума ОНФ ""Форум действий. Крым"" отметил, что федеральной целевой программой по развитию массового спорта для Крыма предусмотрено 4,5 млрд руб. на реконструкцию восьми крупных спортивных объектов. Если отложить реконструкцию одного из них, то на освободившиеся деньги можно построить 2,5 тыс. спортивных площадок для развития массового спорта. Он попросил президента ""пересмотреть назначения"" в пользу таких спортивных площадок. 
В первый день упомянутого форума, 25 октября его работа развернулась на трех тематических площадках: ""Образование и культура как основы национальной идентичности"", ""Качество повседневной жизни"" и ""Честная и эффективная экономика"". Участники мероприятия сосредоточились на наиболее актуальных проблемах, выявленных активистами региональных отделений в Крыму и Севастополе по результатам обработки обращений граждан, опросов, экспертных совещаний

В ответ на западные санкции русские перестали умирать,"0 комментариев 3 поделились Фото: архив Pravda. Ru 
За январь-август 2016 года умерли около 1,27 миллиона человек. ""Это на 21,8 тысячи человек или на 1,7% меньше, чем за соответствующий период 2015 года"", — отметил глава Минтруда. Снижение числа умерших зарегистрировано в 73 регионах. В ряде регионов, включая Республику Алтай, Забайкальский край, Костромскую область, Севастополь, темпы снижения числа умерших составили более 5%. 
С чем связаны такие положительные цифры, Pravda. Ru рассказал ведущий научный сотрудник международной лаборатории политической демографии и макросоциологической динамики ВШЭ, демограф Андрей Коротаев. 
""Главный фактор естественного прироста в эти годы, в эти месяцы этого года, не столько рост рождаемости (он не очень большой), сколько заметное снижение смертности в первые семь месяцев"", — отметил эксперт. Связано это с внедрением — Единой государственной автоматизированной информационной системы (ЕГАИС), которая обеспечила эффективный контроль над продажами алкоголя и резко снизила количество продаваемого нелегального. 
Андрей Коротаев добавил, что в нашей стране официальные продажи выросли, но реальное употребление алкоголя сократилось, потому что алкоголь стал менее доступен. Легальный алкоголь дороже нелегального. Поэтому главный фактор снижения смертности в стране и вообще любого колебания этого показателя принято связывать с алкогольным фактором. ""Благодарим Росалкогольрегулирование"", — объяснил собеседник Pravda. Ru. 
Что касается рождаемости, по мнению демографа, с ней в ближайшее время появятся серьезные проблемы. Всему причина — замораживание материнского капитала — мера абсолютна несвоевременная. Но на данном этапе рождаемость все же растет, на нее влияет региональная политика. В Хабаровске, например, при рождении третьего ребенка полностью погашается размер ипотеки. 
Эксперт Pravda. Ru рассказал, что весь этот позитивный эффект краткосрочен. Стоит готовиться к падению рождаемости и росту смертности. ""ЕГАИС добились заметного снижения смертности, но сейчас, на фоне замораживания акцизов, разговоров про то, чтобы понижать минимальную цену на водку, боюсь, что у нас и смертность начнет расти уже в ближайшее время"", — спрогнозировал демограф Андрей Коротаев.

"""Реакция Венгрии на сюжет Киселева это не угроза России""","Мир » Европа » Восточная Европа Во вторник МИД Венгрии вызвал посла России в связи с ""пренебрежительными комментариями"" в российских государственных СМИ о событиях антисоветского восстания в Венгрии в 1956 году. МИД Венгрии заявил, что российские государственные СМИ описали венгерский бунт как ""погром"" и как первую из ""цветных революций"". Речь идет о сюжете ""Венгры ностальгируют по ""гуляш-социализму"" в программе ""Вести недели"" Дмитрия Киселева, вышедшей в эфир 23 октября. 0 комментариев 0 поделились 
Прокомментировал возникшее недоразумение для Pravda.Ru доктор социологических наук, директор Института междисциплинарных исследований Алексей Новоточинов. 
- Считаете ли вы реакцию Венгрии адекватной? А почему бы нам не вызвать венгерского посла и сказать, что не потерпим, как в венгерских СМИ освещаются итоги ВОВ и ее герои? 
— Мне жалко, что Дмитрий Киселев довольно недальновидно, со странным пафосом полез в очень трогательные и ощутимые сферы все еще довольно сложных отношений между Россией и Венгрией. Вот сейчас венгры вызвали посла, я догадываюсь, какие традиционные слова в этой связи могут сказать. Я квалифицирую их просто, как призыв осмотреться, вдуматься и больше этого не делать. 
Я родом из Курской области Касторенского района деревня Скакун, где венгры в годы войны зверствовали так, что даже немцы не выдерживали такого количества увиденного насилия. Наши отношения сейчас с Венгрией очень ранимые. Каждый позитивный шаг дается с колоссальным трудом. 
Хотя Венгрия сегодня смотрит на наши отношения сквозь призму вероятного экономического проекта АЭС Пакш-2 с надеждой на участие русских в этой работе — создание технопарка, реконструкция будапештского метро. 
Со стороны Венгрии, могу вам смело заявить, я работаю с ними не первый год, это совершенно адекватная венгерская реакция, но она не является угрозой, она является призывом цивилизованно остановиться и помалкивать, потому что иначе мы последнего союзника в Европе потеряем. У нас в Европе нет ни одного союзника такого класса, как венгры. 
И последнее, у меня был идеологический спор с довольно высокопоставленными венгерскими чиновниками, близкими к руководству Венгрии, относительно событий 1956 года. Ну, они выложили свой традиционный набор взаимных упреков, рассказов. А я им сказал в ответ, что радуйтесь, что не я там был, я бы вам там перца задал. 
Я пояснил, в чем заключается трагичность событий 1956 года. Она разделяется на две точки зрения. Вы пытались идти на поводу у американцев, которые подпитывали антикоммунистическую ситуацию изнутри. Андропов же, защищал результаты Второй мировой войны, не давая состояться переделу. Уже тогда было понятно, что вся затея с расширением НАТО на Восток будет тяготеть к проблеме передела Европы по отношению к решениям Тегеранской, Ялтинской и Потсдамской конференций. 
Могу сказать, что сегодня Венгрия ограблена, уничтожены такие идеалы экономических образчиков, как ""Икарус"", фирма ""Глобус"", уничтожена авиационная компания Малев (Malév). Фактически ликвидирована фармацевтическая группировка ""Гедеон Рихтер"" (Gedeon Richter Ltd) и многое-многое другое, что строилось на советские деньги. 
- Но, наверное, когда они будут про ""злодеяния Красной армии"" в СМИ вещать, нам ведь тоже молчать не надо? 
— Око за око всегда, в любом случае. Но не жить по принципу — ""сам дурак"". Что значит злодеяния армии? О каких миролюбивых намерениях мы ведем речь, если кадровая армия должна их молотить 24 часа в сутки. Это было и в 1956 году. Вы хотите, чтобы мы там с цветами и с мороженом ездили? Злодеяния придумали. Нужно четко держаться мысли, что Советский Союз на тот момент жестко защищал результаты Второй мировой войны, нашу победу. Нам навязывали другую точку зрения, которая сейчас вылилась просто в банальное расширение НАТО вплоть до нашей государственной границы. Нас обманули. Нас просто кинули благодаря болтунам типа Хрущева, Горбачева, Ельцина. Если венгры будут это продолжать, в чем я тоже глубоко сомневаюсь, то это будут делать люди, отнюдь не представляющие власть и не представляющие из себя ничего. 
Я думаю, что думающие люди на перспективу не допустят разжигание очередной фазы нервотрепки. Тем более, что можно смело утверждать, что в известной степени подобные вещи субсидируются никак не венграми, а тем же конопатым Соросом. Венгры миролюбиво настроены по отношению к России, с точки зрения живой экономики, социально-экономических отношений и усилению долгосрочных связей. Так что Киселев, что называется, не на ту лошадь сел или ставку сделал не на ту тарелку.

Санкции против России - отрезвление близко?,"0 комментариев 3 поделились Фото: Fotodom.ru/DP 
Эксперты Bloomberg уверены: США не будут вводить по-настоящему серьёзные санкции против России. Вашингтон мог бы запретить покупку российских гособлигаций или отключить Россию от системы межбанковских сообщений SWIFT, но это может крайне негативно отразиться на экономике Европы и мира. 
Pravda.Ru обратилась за комментарием подобной смены направления санкционной политики США к первому проректору Финансового университета при правительстве РФ Константину Симонову. 
Пока рано говорить о том, что в США началось некое отрезвление, стоит дождаться новой администрации и посмотреть, какими будут их взгляды, считает эксперт. Нынешнее правительство по-прежнему воспринимает Россию, как противника и оппонента, по-прежнему давит на нас. 
""Надо понимать очевидную вещь: если бы у Соединенных Штатов были бы какие-то реальные возможности по нанесению ущерба нашей экономике, они бы неизбежно их применили "", - отметил Константин Симонов. 
Собеседник Pravda.Ru напомнил, что еще год назад на Западе была следующая концепция: ""Не волнуйтесь, дорогие обыватели, у нас есть секретные приемы против России. Если, грубо говоря, они еще будут наглеть, мы их там прижмем, и им конец"". 
Говорилось о том, что Россию будет отключена от системы SWIFT. ""Это было смешно, я специально поговорил с людьми, которые занимались внешнеэкономической деятельностью до создания SWIFT. SWIFT система уж не такая и старая, торговали раньше без нее, по телексу отправляли платежки"", - поделился эксперт. По сути, SWIFT всегда была секретной кнопкой, на которую невозможно нажать. 
Куда еще расширять санкции? Можно полностью запретить все экономические отношения с Россией, продолжает Константин Симонов. Это, конечно, повлияло бы на российскую экономику. (Глава МИД Великобритании) Борис Джонсон, например, предлагал это. Возникает ответный вопрос: если у вас 42% импорта газа - российский газ, а треть рынка нефти - это российская нефть, то как вы собираетесь существовать без России? 
Надо сказать, что санкции породили антисанкции, которые болезненно воспринимаются европейскими предприятиями. Например, Италия, исторически не раз терпевшая поражение от России, успела пожалеть о введении санкций . ""Я неделю был в Вероне (это одна из самых экономически развитых частей Италии) и встретился с крупным итальянским бизнесменом. Говоря о санкциях, он заявил, что русские нам ничего в жизни плохого не сделали. Это мы к ним пришли с Наполеоном там под Березиной, получили тысячи трупов, потом с Гитлером зачем-то полезли туда и получили десятки тысяч трупов. Никогда у итальянцев к русским не было претензий. Никогда они нам ничего плохого не делали. Зачем мы ввели эти санкции, если теперь не сможем торговать?"", - поделился с Pravda.Ru эксперт. 
Тем не менее мы понимаем, что это скорее локальная, бизнесовая точка зрения. Нельзя сказать, что население Европы в целом сильно страдает от того, что против России применены санкции. Пока что эта точка зрения не является мейнстримной, но все может поменяться, заключил Константин Симонов.

"""Собрал наглость в кулак и назвался писателем""","Общество » Практика » Как заработать В советские времена стать писателем было довольно трудно. Недостаточно было просто сочинить что-либо; требовалось добиться, чтобы сочиненное появилось в печати, и желательно не один раз, а потом вступить в профессиональный союз. Зато оставаться писателем было задачей довольно легкой — надо было только хранить свой членский билет и получать гонорары. О том, как обстоят дела сейчас , предлагаем вам узнать на примере писателя Александра Тавера. 0 комментариев 0 поделились 
Наоборот, в послесоветские времена стать писателем оказалось весьма легко: достаточно сочинить что-либо и истратить некоторое количество денег, чтобы услужливое издательство опубликовало сочиненное за авторский счет. Зато оставаться писателем стало делом довольно затруднительным, дорогостоящим и неэкономичным. Можно без труда вступить в любой профессиональный союз, которых расплодилось уже около сотни; членские взносы этот союз охотно возьмет, но на этом его полезная автору деятельность, как правило, и завершается. Членский билет такого союза лучше показывать только добрым знакомым — на остальных он никакого впечатления не производит. Гонорары практически не предусмотрены, особенно в периодических изданиях, где обязанности по заполнению страниц любым способом возложены на штатных сотрудников, работающих за зарплату. 
Выгоды писательского положения исчерпались, а расходы и трудности умножились. Короче говоря, если в советское время при встрече с человеком, которого вам отрекомендовали как писателя, возникала мысль: ""О, этот человек, наверное, многое от жизни получает!"", то в наши дни при встрече с таким же писателем возникает мысль: ""О, этот человек, наверное, многим в жизни жертвует"". 
Тем не менее, и в наши дни появляются отважные люди, желающие быть писателями и развлекать людей собственным литературным трудом только за скудные похвалы, без серьезной надежды на материальное поощрение. Интернет предоставляет им громадное поле деятельности. Каждый месяц сотни тысяч авторов наполняют блоги, чаты, форумы и странички в социальных сетях Рунета своими комментариями, новеллами, эссе, письмами и стихами. Тысячи авторов собирают эти случайные наброски в своих компьютерах и систематизируют их в надежде, что они пригодятся еще кому-нибудь, кроме непосредственного адресата. Сотни авторов, устав дожидаться востребованности, обращаются к издателям — и мигом получают на руки драгоценную книгу с собственной фамилией на обложке. И тут у них возникает вопрос: что делать дальше? 
Писатель Александр Тавер пытается найти достойный ответ на этот вопрос. Его книга ""Эскизы"", вполне прилично изданная в твердом переплете, распространяется как в бумажной, так и в электронной версии. Вопреки наивному мнению, будто книги за свой счет издают в основном люди пенсионного возраста, располагающие свободным временем и хотя бы небольшими накопленными средствами, Александр Тавер оказался человеком сравнительно молодым, энергичным и весьма уверенным в себе. Мы разговорились, я вкрался к нему в доверие, и он вручил мне написанную в третьем лице автобиографию, поразившую меня не фактами жизни, — они характерны для многих, а его отношением к собственному стилю. Недаром говорится: ""Стиль — это человек"". Интернет подсказал: эту крылатую фразу произнес французский естествоиспытатель Жорж Луи Леклерк Бюффон, когда его 25 августа 1763 года избрали в члены Французской академии. Ученый тем самым хотел сказать, что стиль есть неповторимая особенность человека, которая отражает его природные свойства, тогда как идеи, развиваемые им, могут быть достоянием многих. 
""Александр Тавер родился в 1977 году в Ярославле, но большую часть жизни прожил в Сибири, куда его семья переехала в начале 80-х. По образованию — прикладной математик. С 2000 года живет в Израиле, где, как и положено новому репатрианту, успел перепробовать целый ряд профессий и даже попытать силы в бизнесе, пока не остановился на профессии программиста. Он не планировал литературной карьеры, но его своеобразный, ироничный и легкий стиль письма неоднократно замечали люди, состоявшие с ним в переписке или читавшие его тексты, вроде заметок для школьных стенгазет. С этого все и началось — с писем. Получатели хранили их годами, перечитывали друзьям, и не раз Александру доводилось слышать: ""Когда ты напишешь книгу?"" Он в ответ лишь посмеивался: ""Да кому это нужно? Посмотрите на писателей и посмотрите на меня. Я рад, что вам нравится, но книга — дело серьезное"". В начале 2000-х он стал одним из множества блоггеров, и история с письмами повторялась: люди хотели больше, но все разговоры о книгах натыкались на тот же ответ: блоггер развлекает мимолетную публику или постоянных подписчиков, куда ему до писателя. Даже мутация блогов, чатов и форумов в социальные сети ничего не изменила. Он продолжал интересно и с юморком описывать забавные случаи из жизни, в том числе и своей собственной, иногда сочиняя что-нибудь забавное ради эпатажа. Гром грянул осенью 2014-го. Особенный гром, слышный только ему, заставивший остановиться и переосмыслить происходящее. Ответ на вопрос ""Кому это нужно?"" был совсем рядом. Его давно окружали сотни читателей, ждавших от него книги. Они говорили об этом открытым текстом на протяжении многих лет. Так пришло решение собрать лучшие из сочинений, подвергнуть, в меру сил, литературной обработке и издать"". 
Александру Таверу повезло, он слышал гром. Я перечитал ""Эскизы"" и никакого грома не услышал. Что ж, по-видимому, и в самом деле это был гром, слышный только ему. И я попытался уточнить некоторые аспекты этого явления природы дополнительными вопросами: 
— Вы полагаете, что написали действительно хорошую книгу? 
— Достаточно хорошую, чтобы быть изданной и найти благодарного читателя. Я могу сколько угодно считать ""Эскизы"" далекими от идеала и втайне стыдиться отдельных откровенно неуклюже написанных абзацев; но факт остается фактом — эту книгу перечитывают и с нетерпением ждут следующей. 
— Вы рассчитываете сделать литературную карьеру? 
— Скорее первые неуверенные шаги к ней. Каковы составляющие литературной карьеры в моем понимании? Быть востребованным читателями? Я достаточно востребован. ""Эскизы"" я выпускал для сотен, а сейчас меня читают тысячи. Писать хорошие книги? Я считаю, что книга хороша, если ее не только читают, но и перечитывают. Меня перечитывают. Обладать хорошим литературным стилем? Вот тут я вынужден в себе усомниться. Я считаю свой слог далеко не идеальным и постоянно над ним работаю. Все-таки писательство — огромная ответственность; не хочется являть пред очи читателя абы что. Само название сборника ""Эскизы"" символизирует для меня некую сделку с совестью. Я знал, что отправляю в редакцию далеко не идеальные тексты, и даже похвала главного редактора и чисто символические правки меня не переубедили. ""Считай, что показываешь людям наброски будущей картины. Просто сделай следующую книгу лучше этой"". И наконец, карьера подразумевает, что литература станет моей профессией. Я так же далек от этого сейчас, как мойщик посуды на кухне далек от поста генерального директора. 
— Что же такое, по-вашему, хорошая книга? 
— Смотря как оценивать качество книги. По тиражу? Но я видел книги, вышедшие тиражом в десятки экземпляров и намного более интересные, чем другие, издававшиеся сотнями тысяч. Может, по долговечности их оценивать? Хороша ли книга лишь потому, что она пережила века? Сомневаюсь. По красоте сюжета? Богатству языка? Жанру? Тут все зависит от индивидуальных предпочтений читателя. Если уж говорить о личных критериях оценки качества книг, то я считаю хорошими те из них, которые мне хочется перечитывать. 
— То есть все книги, которые стоят у вас дома, хорошие? 
— Вовсе нет. Нравится произведение или нет — труд автора я уважаю. Если откладываю книгу, не дочитав, ей всегда найдется место на книжной полке до тех пор, пока она не найдет своего читателя. 
— Имела ли ваша книга коммерческий успех или принесла только убытки? 
— Ни то, ни другое. Расходы на подготовку к изданию, иллюстрирование, создание аудиоверсии и печать первого тиража окупились, однако рекламная кампания издательства оказалась катастрофически провальной. Я потратил на нее больше денег, чем на все остальное вместе взятое, но на сегодняшний день издательство отчиталось ровно об одной продаже. 
— Получается, чтобы стать писателем, достаточно объявить себя таковым и заплатить издательству? 
— Даже менее того. Можно объявить себя писателем, не платя издательству и просто выкладывая тексты в интернет. Это так же легко, как объявить себя гуру или тренером и давать онлайн-советы. Можно представляться кем угодно и создавать видимость успеха в любой области. Интернет все стерпит. Но несоответствие образа действительности рано или поздно проявится. Гораздо важнее, кем тебя на самом деле признают другие. Люди, читавшие мои сочинения, признали меня писателем, как бы скептически я ни относился к такой оценке своего творчества. Когда накопилась некая критическая масса читателей, считающих меня интересным автором, когда у них появилось желание стать обладателями моих книг, я собрал всю свою наглость в кулак и назвался писателем. Разумеется, такое признание льстит моему самолюбию, и я много работаю над тем, чтобы действительно заслуживать это звание. 
— Состоите ли вы в какой-либо писательской организации? Помогают ли такие объединения писателю-новичку? 
— Я настолько новый человек в литературной среде, что еще не успел присоединиться ни к одному профессиональному писательскому союзу. Очень хочется присоединиться к союзу или литобъединению, подходящему мне по духу и открывающимся возможностям. Пока я лишь присматриваюсь к тем немногим, которые удалось найти, слежу за их активностью и мероприятиями. К сожалению, в Рамат-Гане, где я живу, пока не нашел ни одного. Очень надеюсь, что просто плохо искал, и на самом деле они существуют. Просто числиться где-то так же легко, как и объявить себя писателем. Я как автор, остро чувствующий ответственность перед читателем за качество своих произведений, выберу объединение, которое поможет мне профессионально вырасти. 
Живое общение с читателем, безусловно, идет мне на пользу. Не забывайте, что именно благодаря ему я и стал писателем. Как автору, мне всегда интересно выслушивать мнения о своих произведениях и узнавать о впечатлении, которое они производят. Оценки и толкования бывают разными, вплоть до диаметрально противоположных. Критика учит, а похвала вдохновляет на новые свершения. Юрий Мамлеев: можно ли прожить литературным трудом",1

Форум организован Общероссийским народным фронтом, в мероприятии принимают участие более 350 человек — это активисты ОНФ, федеральные и региональные эксперты Народного фронта, представители исполнительной власти и журналисты. 
Президент напомнил, что Общероссийский народный фронт был первым общественным объединением , которое начало работу в Крыму после проведения референдума о статусе полуострова. И хотя с того времени была проведена большая работа, однако это недостаточно, подчеркнул он. 
Глава государства отметил, что в первую очередь следует сосредоточиться на чувствительных для граждан вопросах — модернизации социальной инфраструктуры, обновлении транспортной сферы, создании новых рабочих мест. И при этом грамотно распределять финансы на реализацию всех проектов. 
""Крайне важно слышать мнение людей, понимать, какие вопросы их больше всего волнуют. Без этого меры по развитию региона не будут в полной мере эффективны"", — подчеркнул глава государства, отметив востребованность механизмов Общероссийского народного фронта. 
""Я надеюсь, что активисты ОНФ продолжат свою работу по мониторингу и анализу наиболее острых проблем, волнующих крымчан, по выработке конкретных предложений по решению проблем"", — сказал Путин. 
По словам главы государства, предыдущие форумы ОНФ (""Форумы действий"" в этом году прошли в Ставрополе и Йошкар-Оле — прим.) показали, что такие мероприятия дают возможность не только обменяться мнениями, но и найти способы решения проблем. 
Отдельно Владимир Путин остановился на преодолении попыток блокады полуострова . 
По его словам, ""в сжатые сроки сняты вопросы энергетической, водной блокады полуострова, хорошими темпами идет строительство транспортного перехода через Керченский пролив"". 
""Рассчитываю, что и подходы к мосту и вся необходимая сопутствующая инфраструктура также будут сданы качественно и в срок"", — добавил он. 
По словам главы государства, в будущем Крымский мост позволит перевозить до 14 миллионов туристов и 13 миллионов транспортных средств в год. 
Инициаторов же блокады российский лидер назвал ""удивительными идиотами"". 
""Думали, что все встанут на колени и будут просить подачку? Удивительные идиоты"", - сказал Путин. 
""Что касается прекращения подачи воды, либо акции, связанной с блэкаутом, прекращением подачи электроэнергии, все это на грани преступления против человека: взять достаточно крупный регион с многомиллионным населением — 2,6 млн человек проживает (в Крыму) — и отключить от электроснабжения зимой"", — сказал глава государства . 
""У нас правозащитные организации что-то воды в рот набрали и язык проглотили и молчат, а на самом деле это серьезное преступление"", — подчеркнул Путин. 
Отдельно президент остановился на проблемах в сфере здравоохранения полуострова. В частности, вопросах информатизации. 
Накануне на одной из тематических площадок форума речь шла о том, что большая часть компьютерного оборудования, закупленного за последние два года для медицинских организаций Крыма и Севастополя, не функционирует, а сотрудники медучреждений не имеют им пользоваться. К тому из-за плохого качества интернета в Крыму не создана единая сеть медучреждений. 
""Если вы считаете, что один из таких вопросов, текущих, но важных — информатизация, мы обязательно над этим не просто подумаем, а мы его в самое ближайшее время начнем более эффективно решать, чем это было до сих пор. Министр (здравоохранения Вероника Скворцова) здесь находится. Я вас прошу мне доложить, какие дополнительные шаги, чтобы эту проблему начать прямо сейчас закрывать"", — сказал президент, отметив также важность строительства новых медицинских центров в Крыму и Севастополе. 
Владимир Путин, общаясь с участниками форума, подчеркнул важность процесса реабилитации коренных народов Крыма. На эти цели в Федеральной программе развития полуострова выделяет десять миллиардов рублей. 
""Прежде всего, речь идет о социально-экономической поддержке, потому что политические вопросы уже решены — это касается языка, культуры, возможности обучения на родном языке, периодических изданий"", — сказал Путин. 
Глава государства отметил, что многие поселки крымских татар находятся в печальном состоянии — там и дороги нужны, и социальные объекты, нет электричества и элементарных удобств. Но этот ресурс, как сказал президент, ограничен и пока что его хватит только на тех представителей коренных народов, которые проживают на полуострове в настоящий момент. Путин обратился к активистам ОНФ следить за тем, насколько ритмично и рационально распределяются эти ресурсы. 
""Любые средства, которые выделяются федерацией или республикой, или Севастополем, должны находится под общественным контролем"", — сказал президент. 
Один из участников форума пригласил главу государства посетить праздник крымских татар в мае. 
""У нас есть такой праздник — Хедерлез. Это наш национальный праздник, он есть только у крымских татар. Я знаю, что вы в 2000 году были в городе Казани на сабантуе. И, пользуясь случаем, хочу вас пригласить на Хедерлез в следующем году в мае месяце. Все крымские татары будут рады вас видеть"", — сказал участник форума. 
""Если в России абсолютно в любом месте скажете, что сегодня сабантуй, все поймут, что праздник. Хедерлез пока так широко не известен, но надеюсь, что это тоже будет достоянием культуры жителей всех народов России. За приглашение спасибо большое"", — ответил на это Владимир Путин.",1
Поезд Сапсан задержался в пути из-за погодных условий,"0 комментариев 0 поделились источник Pravda.Ru 
Как пишет РИА Новости, состав в итоге прибудет в северную столицу на 2,5-3 часа позже указанного в расписании времени. 
Следовавший из Москвы в Санкт-Петербург поезд из-за образовавшейся на путях наледи застрял в Новгородской области, отмечает издание. По данным Октябрьской железной дороги (ОЖД), ""к месту остановки состава выслан вспомогательный локомотив и резервный «Сапсан». Опоздание поезда составит ориентировочно 2,5-3 часа"". 
Издание отмечает, что в Санкт-Петербурге пассажиров опоздавшего «Сапсана» развезут по домам три автобуса. 
Напомним, ""Сапсан"" № 778 был задержан в среду в 22:21 мск на станции Мстинский Мост в Новгородской области. При этом в 22:45 мск по техническим причинам там же был остановлен еще один «Сапсан», который прибудет в Санкт-Петербург на полчаса позже запланированного времени. 
На той же станции в Новгородской области в 22:45 мск по техническим причинам остановлен еще один ""Сапсан"". Он прибудет в Санкт-Петербург на 30 минут позже запланированного времени. 
""Специалисты Октябрьской железной дороги делают все возможное для скорейшего ввода поездов в график"", - отмечает железная дорога. 
Правда.ру ранее писала, что спешившая на скоростной поезд ""Сапсан"" пассажирка разбила стеклянную дверь автобуса во время движения по Невскому проспекту в Петербурге. 
Согласно информации пресс-службы предприятия ""Пассажиравтотранс"", инцидент произошел в среду вечером, когда маршрутный автобус № 3 подъезжал к остановке на Невском проспекте около дома № 77. В тот момент пассажирка автобуса, сильно торопясь успеть на свой рейс и не дожидаясь плановой остановки, выбила стеклянную дверь ногой и сбежала. На опубликованном в социальных сетях фото с места событий видно, что стекло в двери автобуса отсутствует полностью. 
По словам представителя ""Пассажиравтотранс"", поймать девушку на месте сразу не удалось, поэтому предприятие обратилось за помощью к полиции. О задержании спешившей пассажирки информации пока не поступало, как и том, успела ли девушка на ""Сапсан"". 
А недавно высокоскоростной ""Сапсан"", проезжая этот участок по пути из Петербурга в Москву, насмерть сбил двух мужчин. Скорость состава была 200 километров в час. По мере приближения к платформе, заметив двух людей, переходящих пути, машинист нажал тревожную кнопку, однако те не отреагировали на сигнал и не отошли, в результате чего их буквально затянуло воздушной волной. 
Как сообщили в местном управлении МВД, после экстренного торможения и наезда на людей машинист не остановился и продолжал маршрут. Погибшими оказались двое мужчин из Карелии, подрабатывавшими в этой области в электричках. Они были глухонемыми и не услышали важного сигнала. 
По факту инцидента проводится проверка.

Россия передала Нидерландам материалы по крушению Boeing на Украине,"0 комментариев   
Как сообщает информационный портал Dutch News со ссылкой на нидерландского министра юстиции Арда ван дер Стера, Россия передала западным специалистам радиолокационные снимки, связанные с крушением лайнера. 
Министр подчеркнул, что решение о том, могут ли материалы использоваться в уголовном расследовании примет прокуратура Нидерландов. 
По данным РИА Новости, совместная следственная группа (JIT) обнародовала 28 сентября предварительный доклад. В нем утверждается, что поразивший Boeing ЗРК ""Бук"" был доставлен из России, а потом возвращен обратно. 
При этом в МИД России заявили о предвзятости следствия, выводы которого основаны только на данных, полученных от Украины. Эксперименты концерна ""Алмаз-Антей"" также подтверждают, что Boeing был сбит с территории, контролировавшейся украинской армией. 
Всероссийский центр изучения общественного мнения (ВЦИОМ) недавно провел исследование, согласно которому только 4% россиян верят в версию Запада о причастности ополченцев ЛДНР и российских спецслужб к крушению Boeing МН-17 в Донбассе . 
""Малайзийский Boeing, сбитый над территорией Донбасса более двух лет назад, половина россиян (50%) считает жертвой нападения украинских военных. С предположением о виновности западных спецслужб согласны 14% наших сограждан. Терактом называют произошедшее 8% респондентов. К настоящему моменту катастрофа получила крайне широкий резонанс в российском обществе: о ней слышали почти все жители страны"", - говорится в материалах опроса ВЦИОМ, опубликованных на сайте организации. 
О результатах расследования международной следственной группы, в которых утверждается, что самолет был сбит с территории, контролировавшейся ополченцами Донбасса, из пусковой установки, привезенной из России, знают 64% россиян. При этом каждый пятый (21%) не видит значимых последствий для России в связи с выводами комиссии по расследованию инцидента, две пятых (40%) затруднились сказать, может ли оно как-то повлиять на нашу страну и граждан. 
Из результатов опроса следует, что версии о причастности к атаке на самолет ополченцев ДНР и ЛНР либо российских спецслужб крайне непопулярны: о том, что в них верят, сказали, соответственно, 4% и 1% опрошенных. 
В опросе приняли участие 1600 человек в 130 населенных пунктах в 46 областях, краях и республиках всех федеральных округов России. 
Напомним, что международная группа следователей пришла к выводу, что малайзийский Боинг был сбит ракетой «Бука», который якобы был доставлен ополченцам из России.

В России могут ввести налог на депозиты?,"0 комментариев   
Одним из вариантов пополнения федерального бюджета может стать введение налогообложения части депозитов,заявил заместитель ведомства Алексей Моисеев в ходе лекции в Финансовом университете при правительстве РФ, сообщил "" Интерфакс"" . 
Подчеркнув, что это предложение пока не закреплено ни в одном из законопроектов, он сообщил, что в министерстве думают над тем, как именно воплотить его в жизнь. 
""По депозитам есть совершенно исключительный в мировой практике налоговый вычет, когда люди в принципе не платят по ним ничего, - посетовал чиновник. - Человек, имея миллиард рублей на депозите, а такие люди есть, и их довольно много, не платят никаких налогов с доходов своих депозитов. Так больше делать нигде нельзя"". 
При этом варианты исполнения президентского поручения все еще рассматриваются в ведомстве. Напомним, что в декабре прошлого года в послании Федеральному собранию президент РФ Владимир Путин поручил экономическому блоку правительства подготовить предложения об отмене налогообложения купонов по облигациям. 
Средства Сбербанка могут стать источником пополнения ликвидности для Внешэкономбанка, сообщают российские СМИ. 
Как пишет Ведомости, по предложению руководства госкорпорации, ее качественные кредиты должен выкупить Сбербанк. Согласно предложения, для улучшения ситуации с ликвидностью Внешэкономбанк готов продать пакет высокачественных кредитов на сумму не менее 30 млр рублей, причем покупателем этих кредитов выступит Сбербанк. 
Финансовый директор Сбербанка Александр Морозов, заявил, что такой вариант может быть рассмотрен, но конкретные предложения не поступали. 
Как пишет РБК, ранее новый председатель ВЭБа Сергей Горьков представил план мероприятий по повышению финансовой устойчивости банка. Согласно плану Горькова, ВЭБ предлагается докапитализировать из бюджета (власти выделят на поддержку Внешэкономбанка 150 млрд руб.) и средств Центробанка, который должен конвертировать долг банка в субординированный кредит - его можно будет включить в капитал второго уровня. 
При этом ВЭБ планирует получить дополнительный депозит на 55 млрд руб. от Федерального казначейства и продление от ФНБ истекающего в июне депозита в 50 млрд руб (или его замещение депозитом Газпромбанка).Около 100 млрд руб. ВЭБ рассчитывает получить и от пенсионных накоплений за счет размещения средств Пенсионного фонда, банк также готов продать долю в «Газпроме» (ему принадлежит 2,7% его акций, которые, по данным Лондонской биржи, на 29 марта стоили $1,3 млрд) и часть проблемных активов.

В Италии произошло два землетрясения подряд,"0 комментариев   
Как сообщает Reuters со ссылкой на Геологическую службу США, это было второе за вечер сильное землетрясение в этом районе. Ранее сообщалось о другом землетрясении - магнитудой 5,4.Эпицентр второго землетрясения, по данным службы, располагался около города Кастельсантанджело-суль-Нера (центральная область Марке). 
По словам мэра Мауро Фалуччи, в городе отключилось электричество.Как отмечает Reuters, оба землетрясения «были достаточно сильными и их ощутили 150 км южнее - в Риме, где лампы закачались на верхних этажах зданий». По данным РБК, власти города Виссо, располагающегося недалеко от эпицентра, заявили о нескольких пострадавших. 
По информации Геофизической службы РАН, на которую ссылается ведомство, сейсмособытие произошло в 9:15. Его эпицентр залегал в акватории Тихого океана, в 226 километрах к востоку от города Курильска. 
Как пишет Российская газета, жители островного региона подземных толчков не ощутили. Об угрозе возникновения цунами не сообщается. 
Правда.ру ранее писала, что в Японии сейсмологи зафиксировали землетрясение магнитудой 6,5 - подземные толчки произошли южнее Токио в Тихом океане. 
Как пишет РИА Новости, о жертвах сообщений нет. В ообщении метеослужбы Японии говорится, что очаг подземного толчка находился на глубине 10 км в Тихом океане к югу от Токио. По японской шкале оценки силы землетрясений, магнитуда этих толчков не превысила 1 балл. 
Тем не менее, землетрясение ощущалось в девяти префектурах Японии. Информации о жертвах и возможных разрушениях пока не поступала, угроза цунами не объявлялась. 
Правда.ру ранее писала, что 12 сентября подземные толчки магнитудой 4,9 и 5,4 были зафиксированы возле города Кёнджу (Кёнсан-Пукто) в 370 км от Сеула. 
Об этом сообщает геологическая служба США (USGS). 
Информации о жертвах и разрушениях не поступало. Ранее в Северной Корее был зарегистрирован толчок магнитудой 5,3, что стало следствием ядерных испытаний. 
Как уточнили в ведомстве, на пять часов утра по местному времени (23-00 12 сентября по Москве) общее число пострадавших составило восемь человек, большинство из которых находились рядом с эпицентром толчков: пятеро пострадавших - из провинции Северная Кенсан, двое - из Тэгу и еще один - из провинции Южная Чолла. 
В основном люди пострадали от упавшей мебели и кусков зданий, но два человека получили ранения, когда решили спрыгнуть на землю со второго этажа, испугавшись подземных толчков. В то же время ранения у всех легкие, жизни пострадавших угрозы нет, пишет Правда.ру. 
23 августа в Италии произошло землетрясение магнитудой 6,4 . Подземные толчки зафиксированы недалеко от города Перуджа.

Обстрел школы в Сирии: погибли 22 ребенка и 6 учителей,"1 комментариев   
Как сообщили в Детском фонде ООН (ЮНИСЕФ), ""двадцать два ребенка и шесть учителей, согласно полученным сведениям, были убиты сегодня, когда здание их школы было неоднократно атаковано в Идлибе, Сирия"", «Это трагедия. Если это было сделано намеренно, то это - военное преступление»,- приводит AFP слова директора ЮНИСЕФ Энтони Лейка. 
До этого правозащитники сообщали, что «военные самолеты или российские, или сирийские нанесли шесть ударов» по деревне Хасс Лэйк отметил, что произошедшее является трагедией или военным преступлением. 
По его словам, речь идет о возможно самом смертоносном нападении на школу в Сирии с момента начала конфликта в стране в 2011 году. 
Как пишет РИА Новости, постоянный представитель РФ при ООН Виталий Чуркин назвал ужасным сообщение об ударе по школе в сирийском Идлибе. ""Мне проще всего сказать, что это не мы, но я ответственный человек, так что мне нужно подождать и посмотреть, что скажет наше министерство обороны"", - цитирует дипломата ТАСС. 
Телеканал Al-Jazeera сообщает, что близкие к оппозиции сирийские правозащитники возложили ответственность за авиаудар на Россию. 
Напомним, Идлиб - провинция на северо-западе Сирии, граничит с провинцией Алеппо. Территорию Идлиба в 2015 году контролировала террористическая организация ""Джебхат ан-Нусра"" (запрещена в РФ), и самолеты российских ВКС наносили удары по этому региону. В декабре 2015 года агентство Reuters со ссылкой на спасателей сообщало о гибели десятков мирных жителей в результате налета российских самолетов. 
Вооруженное противостояние продолжается в Сирии с марта 2011 года. По данным ООН, погибли более 220 тысяч человек. 
США и их союзники с 2014 года проводят в Ираке и Сирии операцию против ИГ. В ночь на 17 октября премьер-министр Ирака Хайдер аль-Абади заявил о начале военной операции по освобождению Мосула от боевиков ИГ. Иракские военные и силы полиции, а также курдские формирования при поддержке авиации коалиции во главе с США начали массированное наступление на город. 
Однако это наступление может обернуться катастрофой на Ближнем Востоке. Об этом заявил, к примеру, кандидат в президенты США Дональд Трамп. Или вот мнение отставного полковника США Дэниэла Дэвиса, которое он изложил в статье, опубликованной в The National Interest : Америке и силам коалиции стоит поторопиться с проведением операции в Мосуле, в противном случае террористы могут разорвать этот альянс в клочья.

Socialismo ou Barbárie,"Enviar para um amigo No modelo chinês, ele é sustentado por um regime autoritário e pode se expandir livremente, sem quaisquer contestações. O ocidental, teoricamente, deve respeitar determinadas regras democráticas, embora em caso de necessidade, essas regras possam ser sempre flexibilizadas. O capitalismo ocidental, que nos diz mais respeito, não olha para a geografia mundial com os mesmos olhos de quem examina um mapa. Ele não enxerga países. Mercados produtores e mercados consumidores. Seu único objetivo é o lucro acima de tudo. E para alcançá-lo não existem mais barreiras nacionais. Sua bandeira é o livre comércio. Todas as fronteiras abertas, não para facilitar a circulação das pessoas, mas para garantir a compra e venda de bens de consumo. Quando alguns países teimam em resistir e procuram defender suas riquezas em proveito de seus povos, os meios de persuasão vão de guerras comerciais às guerras reais. O Iraque não aceitou as condições das grandes companhias internacionais para explorar o seu petróleo e para puni-lo, criou-se o governo dos Estados Unidos, como o principal representante desse capitalismo belicoso, praticamente destruí o País. Quando se precisou prejudicar as economias da Rússia e do Irã, baseadas na produção e exportação do petróleo, se forçou a baixa no preço do produto nos mercados internacionais, prejudicando por tabela a economia da Venezuela. Mas não é apenas pela ação armada, que se calam os que resistem a esse capitalismo internacional e ainda sonham com um outro modelo de economia. Veja-se o caso da América do Sul. Depois de derrubar os governos do Paraguai e Honduras com golpes parlamentares, os interesses imperialistas se voltaram para a desestabilização dos governos dos dois principais países sul-americanos, Argentina e Brasil. No caso da Argentina, com uma ampla campanha de denúncias através de uma mídia corrupta e venal, foi possível se chegar ao poder por via eleitoral e liquidar o projeto populista dos governos do casal Kirchner e colocar no poder um político sensível aos interesses imperialistas. No Brasil, houve uma conjugação de forças entre um parlamento extremamente corrompido, o judiciário e a mídia, para afastar uma Presidente que, de alguma maneira, não seguia todos os pontos do modelo neoliberal que interessa ao capitalismo internacional. Não é coincidência, que o processo de desestabilizou do Governo Dilma tenha se iniciado através de um assalto a Petrobrás, que com a descoberta do pré-sal se tornara uma forte concorrente ás grandes empresas petrolíferas internacionais. Em 2013, Edward Snowden, ao divulgar alguns documentos secretos da Agência Nacional de Segurança dos Estados Unidos (NSA), mostrou que esse serviço espionava há algum tempo o trabalho da Petrobrás. Agora, o alvo principal na América do Sul é a Venezuela, que teve sua economia abalada pela queda fabricada nos preços internacionais do petróleo A mídia internacional (na Zero Hora existe um jornalista com uma obsessão quase doentia de falar mal da Venezuela), com o apoio de lideranças políticas golpistas internas, procuram derrubar um governo constitucional usando todas as armas possíveis. Apesar disso, com o apoio da população mais pobre, o Governo da Venezuela resiste e continua executando sua política de melhorias sociais no País. Embora isso não seja publicado na mídia golpista, o governo do Presidente Maduro aprovou para 2017 a aplicação de 73% do orçamento nacional, estimado em quase 850 milhões de dólares em projetos sociais, principalmente em educação e saúde. A médio prazo, as experiências com governos reformistas, no Brasil, Uruguai, Paraguai, Venezuela, Bolívia e Equador, nascidos a partir de inéditas mobilizações populares, estão condenadas a ser sepultadas pelas novas exigências do capital monopolista internacional, cada vez menos produtivo e mais financeiro. A longo prazo, a única meta pela qual vale a pena lutar é a busca de uma sociedade socialista, pois como diz Istvan Meszaros sobre o capitalismo no século XXI, a opção continua sendo a mesma citada por Rosa Luxemburgo, há quase 100 anos: socialismo ou barbárie.

Москва ввела в эксплуатацию систему по борьбе с превышением скорости,"  
Как пишет Коммерсант, система под названием ""Пит-стоп"" позволяет инспекторам ДПС оперативно задерживать злостных нарушителей скоростного режима, используя данные с автоматических камер, и направлять материалы в суды. 
По данным издания, максимальное наказание, которое применяла ГИБДД за это нарушение с использованием автоматических комплексов ранее составляло 5 тысяч рублей. Теперь же нарушителям грозит лишение прав. 
Таким образом, в распоряжении сотрудников ДПС теперь 50 нетбуков с доступом к данным о всех нарушениях, зафиксированных автоматическими камерами (всего по городу их 934). Инспектор оперативно получает данные о водителях, злостно нарушающих скоростной режим в зоне патрулирования экипажа ДПС - речь идет о превышении скорости на 60 километров в час и выше. 
Решение о преследовании и задержании нарушителя принимается по расчетному маршруту его движения, построенному системой. Если нарушителя удается задержать - составляется протокол, материалы направляются в суд. Если нет - собственнику автомобиля придет штраф. 
26 октября в результате столкновения в Подмосковье микроавтобуса с двумя грузовиками погибли семь человек, еще шестеро получили тяжелые травмы. 
Согласно сообщениям пресс-службы областной полиции. микроавтобус двигался со скоростью не менее 100 километров в час и ехал в опасной близости с грузовиком, который столкнулся на 36-м километре дороги ""Дон"" с большегрузом. 
По уточненным данным, в микроавтобусе Volkswagen находились 12 пассажиров и водитель. Сообщается, что об аварии на 36-м километре трассы М4 «Дон» первые сведения поступили около 06:00. Столкновение произошло на платном участке дороги в районе города Домодедово. 
На месте ЧП прибыли сотрудники ДПС. В ликвидации последствий ДТП принимают участие 25 человек и 8 единиц техники, отметили в областном управлении МЧС . 
В Иваново двое пьяных инкассаторов перевернулись на бронированном служебном автомобиле , не сумев поставить его в гараж. 
Как сообщает ""РГ"" со ссылкой на региональное УГИБДД, ЧП в произошло вечером 14 сентября. 
25-летний водитель, управляя инкассаторским автомобилем ""Практик-2964"", не справился с управлением и опрокинул машину на проезжую часть. 
В результате ДТП пассажир инкассаторского автомобиля, 29-летний мужчина, получил ушиб левой лопаточной области спины. 
По данным ГИБДД, водитель и пассажир являются сотрудниками одной из инкассаторских фирм. После смены инкассаторы распивали спиртное, а затем в нетрезвом состоянии поехали ставить бронированный автомобиль в гараж. Однако, не справившись с управлением, собутыльники перевернулись на дороге, так и не доехав до места назначения. В крови водителя обнаружили 0,53 промилле алкоголя.

Наблюдатели ОБСЕ выявили ряд нарушений при подготовке к выборам в США,"  
Как пишут Вести.ру, стало известно, что в голосовании не смогут принять участие 3,2 миллионов человек, находящихся под следствием или судимых, и 2,6 миллионов уже отбывших наказание. 
Об этом в своем заявлении сообщил директор Бюро по демократическим институтам и правам человека (БДИПЧ) ОБСЕ Михаэль Георг Линк. 
Со своей стороны, наблюдатель ОБСЕ за американскими выборами от Германии Юрген Клинке указала на несоответствие американских выборов международным нормам. 
В частности, из-за разницы часовых поясов результаты выборов в одних штатах будут объявлены тогда, когда голосование в других штатах еще не завершится. По словам Клинке, это является ""неоправданным влиянием на избирателей"". 
Следить за ходом выборов в США российские наблюдатели могут по линии БДИПЧ ОБСЕ , заявил пресс-секретарь Белого дома Джош Эрнест. Прочие запросы американские власти считают ""подозрительными"", учитывая ""действия России в киберпространстве"". 
Отвечая на просьбу прокомментировать сообщения о недопуске российских наблюдателей на выборы в некоторых штатах США, Эрнест сказал: ""Неясно, что именно в этом случае русские собирались делать. Понятно, что люди могут быть подозрительными относительно их мотивов. Или эти мотивы могут отличаться от тех, о которых объявлено публично, с учетом их активности в киберпространстве"". 
Как пояснил Эрнест, после получения таких запросов от иностранных государств Госдепартамент перенаправляет их властям того или иного штата, оставляя решение на их усмотрение. 
Ранее в ряде СМИ появились сообщения о том, что Россия направила запрос официальным властям США с просьбой разрешить наблюдателям из РФ присутствовать на выборах в Луизиане, Оклахоме и Техасе, однако получила отказ. 
""Есть также процесс, организованный по линии ОБСЕ, которая наблюдает за американскими выборами. В прошлом мы успешно сотрудничали с ними. У России была возможность отправить лиц для наблюдения за выборами в США в качестве членов делегации ОБСЕ. Россия отказалась участвовать в таком формате"", - сказал Эрнест.

Джон Керри: Антироссийские санкции только укрепили США и Европу,"  
По словам Керри, Запад остается единым в вопросе сохранения санкций на фоне агрессивной политики России, а после ряда попыток со стороны Москвы вмешаться в предвыборную кампанию в Соединенных Штатах чувство общности, в том числе и в этом вопросе, ""по обе стороны Атлантики"" только укрепилось. 
""Я был в Брюсселе в начале этого месяца и я обнаружил, что чувство общности подходов за Атлантикой демонстрируется каждый день. США и Европа продолжают поддерживать жесткие экономические санкции против России"", - сказал Керри, выступая в совете Чикаго по международным отношениям. 
Керри заявил, что ""наше единство становится еще сильнее"", обвинив при этом Россию в том, что она якобы ""пытается вмешиваться в функционирование нашей демократической системы"". 
В начале октября министерство внутренней безопасности США и Нацразведка обвинили Россию в намеренном взломе почтовых серверов американских граждан и политических организаций с целью вмешательства в избирательный процесс в стране. 
Российские официальные лица отвергают все обвинения американской стороны. Как пишет Аргументы стороны американских властей неоднократно звучали обвинения, что Россия пытается влиять на политическую ситуацию в США. 
В частности, утверждается, что атаки на сервера демократов организованы Кремлем. 
Ранее основатель WikiLeaks Джулиан Ассанж пообещал до конца этого года опубликовать ""значительные данные"" по правительствам трех стран и выборах в США. Об этом он сообщил в ходе видеомоста, который транслируют в Берлине. 
Сведения о президентских выборах в Штатах будут обнародованы до их проведения 8 ноября. 
Ассанж также добавил, что информация о планах ресурса нанести вред кандидату на пост президента США от Демократической партии Хиллари Клинтон ложная.""Было очень много перевирания моих цитат и публикаций WikiLeaks. В этом конкретном случае перевирается цитата о том, что мы хотим навредить Хиллари Клинтон"", - сказал он. 
Джулиан Ассанж также отметил, что ""все заявления о якобы существующих связях между WikiLeaks и Россией абсурдны"". 
Напомним, 4 октября исполняется 10 лет со дня первой публикации документов на сайте WikiLeaks. Ассанж планировал выйти на балкон посольства Эквадора в Лондоне, где он укрывается от британского правосудия, и сделать заявление. Однако выступление было отменено по соображениям безопасности. 
Ранее WikiLeaks обнародовал электронную переписку Демократической партии США. Из опубликованных документов следует, что партийный аппарат демократов во время праймериз работал на Клинтон в ущерб ее конкуренту Берни Сандерсу. Скандал стал причиной отставки руководителя национального комитета Демократической партии. 
Как пишет Взгляд, штаб Клинтон в ответ обвинил во взломе серверов Москву , которая якобы хотела помочь на выборах республиканцу Дональду Трампу. Пресс-секретарь российского президента Дмитрий Песков назвал подобные утверждения абсурдными. Сам Трамп отшутился, что просто нравится президенту России Владимиру Путину, и заявил, что все эти письма демократам вообще не следовало писать.

Юный житель Стерлитамака спас жизнь выпавшей из окна девочке,"  
Юный житель поселка Строймаш Ярослав Адоньев живет вместе с бабушкой и сестрами. В апреле этого года он спас годовалого ребенка, который едва не выпал из окна. Рассказать о своем героическом поступке школьник решился только сейчас. 
По словам мальчика, в тот день он ждал на улице своих друзей и заметил, что на втором этаже на подоконнике стоит маленькая девочка. 
«Я её заметил и сразу понял: что-то плохое может произойти, - рассказал в интервью ""Стерлитамакскому рабочему"" Ярослав. - Смотрю, она всё ближе к краю подходит, ну и я приближаюсь. Только подумал - как ловить, а она уже летит. Руки успел подставить и упал под её весом». 
В итоге девочка только расплакалась, сам же он ничего не почувствовал от шока. Ярослав отделался царапинами на локтях и коленках. Немного придя в себя, мальчик побежал в квартиру, откуда выпал ребенок. Дверь никто не открыл, тогда Ярослав передал малышку соседям, которые позвонили ее матери. 
Мама спасенной девочки потом долго благодарила Ярослава. Поступок оценили и сотрудники полиции, приехавшие на место происшествия. 
Правда.ру ранее писала, что в Железнодорожном районе Хабаровской области после падения с высоты девятого этажа скончался 29-летний мужчина. 
По данным местных СМИ, буквально за несколько минут до трагедии молодой человек выпрыгнул из окна съемной квартиры, расположенной на четвертом этаже. Он спокойно поднялся на ноги, зашел в подъезд и вскоре вновь оказался под окнами дома. 
А недавно рядом с одной из многоэтажек Саранска полицейские обнаружили тело мужчины, одетого в маску и плащ, напоминающие костюм известного героя комиксов Бэтмена. По предварительной информации мужчина выпал из окна на десятом этаже. 
""Установлена личность погибшего, им оказался 51-летний житель многоэтажки, проживавший один на десятом этаже дома. По версии следствия, он покончил жизнь самоубийством"", - говорится в сообщении СУ СК по Республике Мордовия. 
""Сегодня около многоэтажного дома в Саранске было обнаружено тело мужчины с повреждениями, характерными для падения с высоты. На нем была маска и плащ, как у Бэтмэна"", - сообщил источник агентства РИА Новости. 
Правоохранительные органы уже начали доследственную проверку по факту гибели человека. Устанавливаются обстоятельства случившегося, и идет поиск возможных очевидцев трагедии. 
Напомним, что 27 мая в Саранске произошел похожий случай . 85-летний пенсионер упал с балкона, когда вешал белье. 
Его жена рассказала, что перед смертью он стирал белье. Потом он вышел на балкон, чтобы развесить вещи, но почему-то свалился за перила. 
Следователи не исключают, что мужчине стало плохо. У него могла закружиться голова или прихватило сердце. Кроме того, не снимают со счетов и версию о том, что мужчина выпал с балкона по своей воле. Поделиться:",1
Владимир Зельдин госпитализирован в тяжелом состоянии,"  
Как пишет Life.ru, Зельдин доставлен в одну из московских больниц.Актер является старейшим из ныне живущих народных артистов СССР и самый взрослый действующий актер планеты. В прошлом году ему исполнилось 100 лет. 
Российским зрителям Владимир Зельдин хорошо известен по ролям более чем в 40 кинокартинах, среди которых «Карнавальная ночь» (1956), «Десять негритят» (1987), «Дядя Ваня» (1970), «Принцесса на горошине» (1976), «Тридцать первое июня» (1978) и многие другие. 
Напомним, в прошлом году актер Зельдин при прохождении обследования в научном центре имени Бакулева сел мимо стула и упал, получив перелом шейки бедра, после чего был успешно прооперирован. 
Правда.ру ранее писала, что операция, проведенная народному артисту СССР Владимиру Зельдину , была успешной, сообщил начальник Управления культуры Минобороны России Антон Губанков. 
Напомним, Владимир Зельдин отметил 100-летний юбилей в феврале этого года . Поздравительную телеграмму актеру направил президент Владимир Путин . По традиции, день рождения именинник отметил бенефисом - в родном Центральном академическом театре Российской армии. 
Зельдин является лауреатом множества наград, в том числе ордена Трудового Красного Знамени, ордена Красной Звезды. В мае этого года Владимир Путин лично вручил Зельдину орден ""За заслуги перед Отечеством"" I степени . Выпускник театрального училища при театре имени МОСПС (сейчас театр имени Моссовета), он работал несколько лет в этом театре, затем в Центральном театре транспорта и в Русском драматическом театре Алма-Аты, а с 1945 года неизменно служит в труппе Центрального театра Российской армии (ранее - Советской армии). Всенародную известность и популярность он получил за работы в фильмах «Свинарка и пастух», ""Сказание о земле Сибирской"", ""Дядя Ваня"", ""Карнавальная ночь"", ""Десять негритят"" и др. Накануне своего юбилея в декабре в Театре Российской армии состоялась премьера спектакля ""Человек из Ламанчи"", где Владимир Зельдин исполнил роль Дон Кихота. ""Роль Дон Кихота - это моя давняя мечта. И я рассматриваю это как самый дорогой подарок своему юбилею. Но на этом я не собираюсь завершать свою карьеру и буду репетировать роль Кутузова в спектакле ""Давным-давно"", где когда-то в молодые годы я играл поручика Ржевского. Этот спектакль будет ставить главный режиссер нашего театра Борис Морозов"", - сказал в интервью РИА ""Новости"" Владимир Зельдин.

Минобороны России: Эвакуация жителей Алеппо была сорвана боевиками,"  
Конашенков пояснил, что представителями сирийских властей и российским Центром примирения планировалось вывезти около 40 мирных жителей из восточных районов Алеппо в безопасные места, однако из-за снайперского огня со стороны боевиков сделать это не получилось. 
По его словам, ""террористы продолжают вести из самодельных реактивных установок беспорядочные обстрелы жилых кварталов города, пресекая выход мирных жителей по действующим гуманитарным коридорам"". 
Добавим, что ранее постоянный представитель России при ООН Виталий Чуркин возложил ответственность на всемирную организацию за не до конца проработанную операцию по эвакуации населения из Алеппо. 
Как сообщили в Детском фонде ООН (ЮНИСЕФ), ""двадцать два ребенка и шесть учителей, согласно полученным сведениям, были убиты сегодня, когда здание их школы было неоднократно атаковано в Идлибе, Сирия"", «Это трагедия. Если это было сделано намеренно, то это - военное преступление»,- приводит AFP слова директора ЮНИСЕФ Энтони Лейка. 
До этого правозащитники сообщали, что «военные самолеты или российские, или сирийские нанесли шесть ударов» по деревне Хасс Лэйк отметил, что произошедшее является трагедией или военным преступлением. 
По его словам, речь идет о возможно самом смертоносном нападении на школу в Сирии с момента начала конфликта в стране в 2011 году. 
Как пишет РИА Новости, постоянный представитель РФ при ООН Виталий Чуркин назвал ужасным сообщение об ударе по школе в сирийском Идлибе. ""Мне проще всего сказать, что это не мы, но я ответственный человек, так что мне нужно подождать и посмотреть, что скажет наше министерство обороны"", - цитирует дипломата ТАСС. 
Вооруженное противостояние продолжается в Сирии с марта 2011 года. По данным ООН, погибли более 220 тысяч человек. 
США и их союзники с 2014 года проводят в Ираке и Сирии операцию против ИГ. В ночь на 17 октября премьер-министр Ирака Хайдер аль-Абади заявил о начале военной операции по освобождению Мосула от боевиков ИГ. Иракские военные и силы полиции, а также курдские формирования при поддержке авиации коалиции во главе с США начали массированное наступление на город.

"Тигр, убивший корову у фермера, пойман под Владивостоком","  
Специалисты оперативной группы по разрешению конфликтных ситуаций между крупными хищниками и человеком департамента охотничьего надзора Приморского края при поддержке Центра ""Амурский тигр"" и Всемирного фонда дикой природы нашли обезображенную хищником тушу коровы вблизи лесного массива, а рядом с ней увидели отпечатки лап, которые, судя по размеру, принадлежали взрослому самцу амурского тигра. 
Директор департамента охотничьего надзора Приморского края Дмитрий Панкратов пояснил, что ""самец тигра постоянно обследовал эту территорию. Да, она находится в некоторой близости от населенных пунктов, в частности города Артем, но, тем не менее, это лесные угодья. Хищник и ранее позволял себе приближаться к животным фермеров, но здесь он перешел грань. Поэтому было принято решение о его поимке"". 
К настоящему моменту хищника отловили и доставили в Центр реабилитации и реинтродукции тигров и других редких животных (ПРОО ""Центр Тигр"") в селе Алексеевка. Как показал осмотр, это взрослый самец, примерно 4-5 лет и весом более 170 килограммов. Анализы, взятые у животного, свидетельствуют о том, что он здоров. Возможно, тигра выпустят на отдаленную от людей территорию, населенную достаточным количеством копытных животных. 
Как отметил руководитель отдела по сохранению редких видов Амурского филиала Всемирного фонда дикой природы Павел Фоменко, прежде чем принять решение о выпуске тигра, нужно проанализировать данные с фотоловушек, установленных в близлежащих районах. 
- Если хищник транзитный, то его выпуск целесообразен в отдаленных районах Приморья. Если это зверь, постоянно обитающий здесь, то имеет смысл рассматривать вариант выпуска на привычные ему места обитания, но уже с контролем его перемещения с помощью ошейника с GPS передатчиком, - сказал он. 
Как рассказывала Правда.Ру , в начале мая в лесном массиве около села Сенокосное обнаружены останки трех голов крупного рогатого скота. После осмотра убитых животных специалисты пришли к выводу, что это сделал амурский тигр. Одну из жертв он частично съел. Из-за чего хищник напал на домашний скот предстоит выяснить специалистам. 
Нападение на крупнорогатый скот тигром, на самом деле, не такое частое явление, как представляется. За год в среднем 4-5 случаев. Специалисты утверждают, что порой трудно винить животное в подобных случаях, так как, зачастую, домашние животные находятся на вольном выпасе, довольно - таки далеко от населенного пункта. Поэтому тигру сложно понять, почему животное находится в лесу, а есть его нельзя. 
""Этот хищник начал нападать на домашних животных еще в прошлом году и продолжает нападения в этом. Кроме того, он представляет угрозу жизни и здоровью людей, которые трудятся на сельхозполях. Поэтому наша задача - не допустить конфликтных ситуаций и поймать его в ближайшее время"", - прокомментировал ситуацию заместитель руководителя департамента по охране, контролю и регулированию использования объектов животного мира администрации Приморского края. Алексей Суровый.

"Школы в Хабаровске ""заминировал"" первоклассник","0 комментариев 0 поделились Фото: Fotodom.ru/Коммерсантъ 
Как сообщает РИА Новости, ссылаясь на представителя городского УМВД, было установлено, что в полицию звонили братья — один учится в первом классе, второй в пятом. Ранее дети на учете не стояли, они из благополучной семьи. 
Сотрудникам полиции ученики пояснили, что просто хотели пошутить и о последствиях не догадывались. 
Мальчикам еще нет 14 лет, поэтому ответственность за поступок будут нести родители. Мать уже вызвана в полицию, на нее составлен административный протокол о ненадлежащем воспитании несовершеннолетних. Родителям грозит штраф, все документы передадут на рассмотрение в суд. 
Отметим, звонки от неизвестных о, якобы, заложенных бомбах в учебных заведениях, нередки. Проблема безопасности в российских школах поднималась много раз, но положение дел, по большей части, оказывается неизменным. Брешь в безопасности не позволяет утверждать стопроцентно, что в школе нет бомбы. 
Несколько лет назад, прямо перед Днем знаний, корреспонденты ""Правды.Ру"" испытали "" школьную безопасность "". Тогда мы пронесли в учебное заведение пустую коробку с надписью ""бомба"" и оставили ее неподалеку от классов. Нам не препятствовала ни охрана, ни педагоги. Причем, также легко и непринужденно мы забрали коробку обратно. 
Частными охранными организациями осуществляется контроль 20 тысяч школ по всей стране. И безопасность детей напрямую зависит от ЧОПа, который коллегиально выбрали родители и педагоги. Если где-то охранники являются настоящими профессионалами и не допустят никаких внештатных ситуаций, то в некоторых фирмах на пост в школе сажают человека, у которого от охранника — лишь надпись на груди. Естественно, что в первом случае услуги обходятся дороже, чем во втором, и выбор зачастую очевиден. 
Если разобраться, то компетентность школьного охранника прямо пропорциональна его стоимости. За небольшие деньги нельзя требовать от сотрудника уникальных способностей. Ведь по большому счету, один человек должен быть экспертом по комплексной безопасности зданий и сооружений, вахтером, личным телохранителем, обладать некоторыми навыками в психологии общения с детьми, быть не агрессивным и образованным. Что и говорить, список внушительный, чего не скажешь о зарплате. На деле школьный охранник, зачастую, вялый молодой человек, которому мало до чего есть дело, а желание отсидеть смену и сбежать ""из этого ада"" является приоритетным. 
Единственное место, которое контролируется такими секьюрити — входная дверь. Во время летних ремонтов в школу можно завезти хоть целый арсенал, а во время учебного года в некоторых школах под носом у охранника торгуют различными наркотическими веществами. 
Загвоздка в том, что, опять же, в тендере на охрану школ выигрывают те, кто просит за свои услуги самую низкую цену. И как бы не убеждали ЧОПы, где охрана действительно чего-то стоит, что их цена оправдана, выбор останавливают на самых недорогих.

Экологи: Число позвоночных на планете с 1970 года уменьшилось более чем в два раза,"0 комментариев 0 поделились Фото: АР 
По данным исследователей, наибольший урон был нанесен пресноводным позвоночным. Их общая численность за указанные 42 года сократилась на 81%. Согласно подсчетам ученых, популяции наземных позвоночных животных за это же время снизились на 38%, морских — на 36%. Специалисты учитывали в своих изысканиях данные о 3 тысячах 706 видах млекопитающих, птиц, рыб, амфибий и рептилий. 
Исследователи пришли к выводу, что ""самой распространенной угрозой"" позвоночным является ""потеря или ухудшение среды обитания"". 
""Ученые на протяжении десятилетий предупреждали, что действия человека подталкивают живые существа к массовому вымиранию. Свидетельства, излагаемые в докладе, подкрепляют этот прогноз"", — сообщает генеральный директор Всемирного фонда дикой природы Марко Ламбертини. 
Эксперты, работающие над составлением исследования, предсказывает, что в случае сохранения наблюдающихся тенденций в сфере жизнедеятельности человека и его воздействия на природу популяции животных на Земле сократятся к концу этого десятилетия на 67%. 
Ранее Pravda.Ru писала, что ежегодно на нашей планете от заболеваний, вызванных загрязнением окружающей среды умирают не менее 5,5 млн человек, причем половина из них — жители Индии и Китая. К такому выводу пришли в результате своих исследований ученые американской компании Health Effects Institutes в Бостоне (США). 
Сейчас уровень загрязнения воздуха в Дели и в Пекине составляет в некоторые дни до 300 микрограмм на кубометр воздуха, что в 8-10 раз превышает лимит, при котором легкие и сердце работают в норме. 
При этом Северная Америка, Западная Европа и Япония за последние 50 лет достигли огромного прогресса в борьбе с загрязнением воздуха, создавая более чистое топливо и двигатели, а также сокращая потребление угля, отмечается в исследовании. Основными источниками загрязнения, согласно данным исследования, являются выбросы с электростанций, заводов, автомобильные выхлопы, продукты горения угля и дров — образующиеся от этого мелкие частицы долго висят в воздухе, не оседая на почву, и представляют большую угрозу для здоровья человека. 
""Загрязнение воздуха занимает четвертое место в списке основных причин смертности в мире, поэтому снижение уровня загрязнения — это чрезвычайно эффективное средство для улучшения здоровья людей, и мы знаем, что нужно делать"", — так прокомментировал итоги американского исследования преподаватель факультета общественного здравоохранения университета Ванкувера (Канада) Майкл Бранер. 
Напомним, в столице Китая объявление наивысшего, ""красного"", уровня экологической опасности — не такой уж редкий случай. Пекин признан одним из самых грязных городов мира, в атмосфере которого зафиксирована самая высокая концентрация диоксида азота и других вредных веществ. Основная причина — большое количество автомобилей на улицах города, а также выброс химикатов на заводах соседних Хэбэя и Хэнаня. Это является причиной очень высокой смертности пекинцев.

Флешки будущего: Ученые объявили алмазы лучшим носителем информации,"0 комментариев 0 поделились 
В докладе, опубликованном в журнале Science Advances, ученые рассказали о создании трехмерного чипа, в котором для хранения памяти используются азото-замещенные вакансии — один из дефектов кристаллической решетки, возникающий при удалении атома углерода и его замене на атом азота. 
Именно это открывает широкие возможности для манипулирования спинами атомов азота, что учеными использовалось для записи информации при помощи лазера. Таким образом удалось обойти затруднение, связанное с ограничением плотности записываемой информации, налагаемым объемом дисковых носителей формата DVD и Blu-Ray. 
По словам американских физиков, плотность размещаемой информации на прототипе оказалась в сотни тысяч раз выше, чем на Blu-Ray. Также данные на чипе, как утверждают ученые, можно перезаписывать неограниченное число раз. 
Ранее Pravda. Ru писала, что Министерство обороны РФ и инновационный центр ""Сколково"" проявили интерес к проекту аспиранта Ижевского госуниверситета Михаила Шаронова. Молодой ученый представил проект создания инновационного носителя информации на основе нейронных сетей, который он назвал "" нейро-флешкой"" . 
Носитель можно использовать как традиционную карту памяти, которая имеет при этом расширенные возможности. Предполагается, что изделие может быть использовано как носитель информации устройств с искусственным интеллектом. 
На созданием ""Нейро-флешки"" помимо Шаронова работает команда из восьми разработчиков на базе кафедры вычислительной техники Ижевского госуниверситета имени Калашникова. 
26-летнему аспиранту было предложено стать резидентом инновационной территории. В свою очередь Минобороны РФ также проявило интерес к новой разработке, предложив Шаронову разработать техзадание с параметрами и местами возможного использования ""нейро-флешки"".

В День народного единства в Москве пройдет массове шествие,"  АР 
Как сообщается на сайте Общественной палаты(ОП), шествие начнется в 10:30 от Пушкинской площади, колонна пройдет по Тверской улице и завершит свое движение на Манежной площади. В 11:00 на пересечении ул. Тверской с улицами Охотный ряд и Моховая начнется митинг-концерт. Предполагается, что участие в мероприятиях примут около десяти тысяч человек. 
Ранее Pravda. Ru писала, что инициативная группа Общественной палаты РФ намерена обратиться к столичным властям с заявкой на проведение шествия и митинга-концерта ""Мы едины"" 4 ноября, в День народного единства. 
В состав инициативной группы вошли, в частности, секретарь ОП РФ Александр Бречалов, первый заместитель секретаря палаты Вячеслав Бочаров, член комиссии ОП РФ по развитию общественной дипломатии и поддержке соотечественников за рубежом, поэт Андрей Дементьев. 
ОП призывает присоединиться к акции гражданских активистов, некоммерческие организации, общественные объединения, национально-культурные автономии, каждого, для кого День народного единства — важный и радостный праздник. 
Напомним, в акции ""Мы едины"" в прошлом году в российской столице приняли участие около 85 тысяч человек. 
Актер Евгений Стеблов ранее рассказал Pravda. Ru об отношении к празднованию Дня народного единства: ""Я родился в советское время и народ привык к так называемым ноябрьским праздникам. Есть это внутреннее какое-то ожидание ноябрьских праздников. Не идеологических, не коммунистических, а просто — в ноябре будет праздник. И когда сделали День народного единства 4-го числа — я считаю, это разумное решение. Оно, с одной стороны, удовлетворяет эту потребность ноябрьских праздников, с другой — ставит все по своим местам, потому что повод гораздо более достойный, чем переворот октябрьский"". 
Согласно опросу Фонда ""Общественное мнение"", День народного единства, который отмечается в России 4 ноября, для большинства россиян уже стал ""родным"" праздником. 
По данным социологов, большинство респондентом были в курсе, какой именно праздник отмечается в России 4 ноября. Так 42% участников опроса верно назвали его ""День единения наций и народностей России"", ""День народного единства"". Некоторые, впрочем, называли его правильно, но приблизительно ""День какого-то единства"". При этом 8% опрошенных уверены, что Россия в эту дату празднует День независимости, а еще 5% — что День России. 
Специалисты Фонда сделали вывод: ""Так или иначе, праздник этот считается нужным, и доля придерживающихся такого мнения год от года растет"". 
При этом многие россияне считают 4 ноября важным для себя праздником. Как заявили социологи, на вопрос ""Если говорить в целом, по вашему мнению, нужен или не нужен России такой праздник, как День народного единства?"" большинство (69%) ответило — нужен. 
В целом россияне отмечают рост чувства единства нации на фоне роста международной напряженности и внешнего давления на Россию. Об этом свидетельствует недавний опрос Всероссийского центра изучения общественного мнения (ВЦИОМ). Как отмечают жители нашей страны, главный объединяющий фактор — это умение объединиться в тяжелые для страны времена.

В Черном море нашли обломки более 40 затонувших кораблей,"0 комментариев 0 поделились 
Исследователей из США, Великобритании и Болгарии интересовал вопрос о том, как резкий подъем уровня моря примерно 12 тыс. лет назад повлиял на жизнь причерноморских народов, пишет журнал National Geographic. 
С борта судна Stril Explorer, оснащенного средствами для подводной картографической съемки, они обследовали участок акватории Черного моря площадью около 2 тыс. квадратных километров, используя дистанционно управляемые аппараты с видео- и фотоаппаратурой. 
Во время этого обследования они обнаружили места 41 кораблекрушения. Собранная ими информация дала возможность получить исключительно четкие изображения погибших судов, которые очень хорошо сохранились на глубинах от 150 до 2200 метров. 
""Самая ранняя из находок относится к концу IХ века, когда большая часть этого региона находилась под контролем Византийской империи, - отмечает журнал. - Кроме того, обнаружено много судов Оттоманской империи XVI- XVIII веков, несколько судов ХIХ века. Особое внимание привлекли обломки итальянского судна, относящегося, вероятно, к ХIV веку"". 
Как отметил в этой связи руководитель экспедиции Джон Адамс из Центра морской археологии при университете Саутгемптона, торговые корабли с Апеннинского полуострова были достаточно частыми гостями в Черном море в Средние века. ""Поразительно то, что сейчас можно увидеть обломки судна - современника Марко Поло"", - добавил он. 
Большинство из обнаруженных экспедицией кораблей были торговыми и перевозили вино, зерно, металлы и лес. Все они погибли в результате штормов, а не в результате боевых действий или нападений пиратов. Как отметил журнал, в будущем году подводные археологи продолжат изучение дна Черного моря. 
Затонувшие старинные корабли на дне морей и океанов находят не так уж и часто. Но каждая такая находка - это настоящий клад, нередко - в прямом смысле. Как рассказывала Правда.Ру, в конце прошлого года у берегов Колумбии дайверы обнаружили затонувший корабл ь, в трюмах которого, как предполагают колумбийские власти, могут стоить миллиарды долларов. 
Найденный исследователями испанский галеон ""Сан-Хосе"" был потоплен англичанами в 1708 году. Считается, что на его борту находилась партия изумрудов, а также большое количество золотых и серебряных монет.

"Две цивилизации: Борьба не на жизнь, а на смерть?","Мир Антироссийская истерия, развернутая на Западе вокруг Украины и Сирии, порой навевает мысль, что не за горами новая мировая война. Насколько этот вывод обоснован? На вопросы главного редактора Pravda.Ru Инны Новиковой в авторской программе ""Необычная неделя"" отвечает ведущий эксперт Центра в оенно-политических исследований МГИМО Михаил Александров. 0 комментариев 0 поделились — Почему так важна Сирия? Это точка, в которой сошлись основные мировые противоречия . И чтобы понять, почему сейчас возможен ядерный конфликт между Россией и США, надо понять суть сирийского конфликта . Если руководствоваться логикой того, что это локальный конфликт, то кто в здравом уме будет думать, что американцы или русские из-за Алеппо начнут ядерную войну? Но на самом деле это проявление глобального конфликта между западной и российской цивилизациями, который начался не вчера и который идет уже в течение нескольких веков. Сейчас наступает момент, когда западная цивилизация почувствовала, что теряет позиции во всем мире. Нарастает многополярность, усиливаются другие цивилизации — китайская, исламская, индийская. И прежде всего это проявляется в экономике. И чтобы удержать экономические, политические позиции, у Запада остается только один инструмент — военная сила . Кто в военном отношении может реально противостоять Западу? Пока только одна страна — это Россия. Более того, российская цивилизация — единственная, которая инициативно предлагает альтернативную повестку дня, альтернативную идеологию международных отношений. Таким образом, на карту поставлено будущее западной цивилизации. Если они не смогут добиться военно-политического доминирования в мире, то экономически они проиграют и тогда им придется отказаться от многих преимуществ и преференций, которые они сейчас имеют. Уровень жизни на Западе существенно понизится, он не сможет влиять на многие мировые проблемы. И тогда встает вопрос вообще о его роли в современном мире. Россию совершенно не устраивает стремление Запада доминировать в мире. Оно, в общем-то, никого не устраивает: ни китайцев, ни индусов, ни жителей исламских стран. В Африке, Латинской Америке тоже никто не хочет этого доминирования. Но многие боятся открыто выступить против него, понимая, что их задавят. Запад постоянно устраивает показательные расправы: над Милошевичем, Хусейном, Каддафи. Почему же сейчас Россия вмешалась в Сирию? Я думаю, что это была месть Путина Обаме за то, что тот устроил на Украине. И если бы на Украине дела шли нормально, мы могли бы и не вмешаться так активно в сирийский конфликт. Но Обама бросил нам вызов, вторгся на постсоветское пространство , устроил государственный переворот и привел к власти откровенно русофобский режим. То есть создал ситуацию, которая реально угрожает нашей национальной безопасности. Украина — не Грузия, это огромная территория, где у нас очень существенные интересы. И наше руководство поняло: если сейчас мы всему этому дадим спуск, никак не отреагируем, то они дальше начнут разваливать и Россию. Последовал ответ в Крыму, на Донбассе, потом наше вмешательство в Сирии. И сейчас в Сирии мы выигрываем, а это означает, что есть реальная возможность остановить наших ""партнеров"". — О становим ИГИЛ или американцев? — Какова цель так называемой проамериканской оппозиции в Сирии? Свергнуть режим Асада, создать суннитский прозападный режим, который будет контролироваться союзниками США, такими как Саудовская Аравия, Катар. Они, собственно, и спонсируют суннитскую оппозицию в Сирии. После чего страна превратится, собственно говоря, в союзника Запада и рассадник международного терроризма. Надо понимать, что ИГИЛ и ""Ан-Нусра"" (организации, запрещенные в России. — Ред. ) - организации, созданные Западом, ЦРУ специально для дестабилизации режимов. Прежде всего, шиитского в Ираке, когда он стал смещаться в сторону союза с Ираном. Американцы в свое время допустили ошибку, безответственно решив вопрос о власти в постхусейновском Ираке, приведя к фактически единоличной власти там шиитское большинство. Оно, поскольку Иран — это шиитская страна, взяло курс на сближение с ним. В Сирии тоже у власти алавиты и шииты. В итоге образовывалась фактическая ""шиитская ось"", очень опасная для Запада. Потому что во главе ее стоит Иран — независимое суверенное государство, выступающее за полицентрическую систему международных отношений. Запад мечтает ""задавить"" и Иран. ИГИЛ в Ираке США создали для того, чтобы не дать возможность местному шиитскому правительству контролировать всю страну и оказывать на него давление: мол, если вы не будете с нами в военном отношении сотрудничать, мы уйдем, но тогда вместо нас, американцев, к вам придет ИГИЛ и всех вас перережет. ИГИЛ, в итоге, ""осел"" в нескольких иракских городах, запасся оружием, потом переместил боевую активность уже в Сирию. Надо понимать, что и ИГИЛ, и ""Ан-Нусра"" — только инструменты западной внешней политики. Когда некоторые наши деятели заявляют о некоем союзе с Западом в борьбе с терроризмом, это глупость. По существу, это лишь дипломатический экивок, озвученный нашим руководством, но его некоторые стали выдавать за чистую монету. На самом деле, как можно сотрудничать с теми, кто, фактически ""крышует"" ""Ан-Нусру"" в Алеппо, кто не дает ее уничтожить, кто бросил все свои информационные, дипломатические и политические ресурсы на поддержку этой террористической организации, кто навязывает прекращение огня для того, чтобы подкинуть ""Ан-Нусре"" боеприпасов, продовольствия? Нам надо просто добить прозападную оппозицию в Алеппо и прекратить все разговоры на эту тему. — Вы сказали, что Сирия — это наша месть за Украину. Насколько вообще правомерно мыслить такими категориями? — Я, конечно же, имел в виду ""политическую месть"". Месть в том смысле, что это ответный ход, а не то, что наш президент лично обиделся и ввел войска в Сирию. Нет, это не личная обида. Это политический ход, направленный на то, чтобы наказать Запад и сдержать его амбиции, и показать, что так больше делать не надо, что с нашими интересами надо считаться, иначе мы вам устроим, не только в Сирии, но и в других регионах ""хорошую жизнь"". — Вернусь к вашему заявлению, данному в одном из интервью: ""Россия должна быть готова вести ядерную войну и в ней победить"". Возможно ли вообще победить в ядерной войне, когда в ней, как вы говорите, нам будет противостоять весь Запад? — Поясню свою мысль… США далеко от нас, перекинуть сюда крупные соединения им достаточно сложно. Да и что смогут сделать пять-шесть тысяч человек, высади у нас их где-нибудь в Сибири? Они помрут там через пару недель. В Европе же далеко не все хотят с нами воевать. Что, Болгария так уж рвется с нами повоевать? Их Бойко Борисов, может, и пойдет, но остальные болгары — вряд ли. Одно дело — голосовать, другое — воевать. Чехи, венгры, словаки — никто не будет воевать. Разве что немцы, поляки, румыны, некоторые страны Бенилюкса. Если посмотреть, то воевать может незначительная часть западного сообщества. Так что мы вполне сможем создать паритет по численности вооруженных сил, даже если они перекинут свои войска. Но тут надо учитывать фактор тактического ядерного оружия. У нас превосходство над Западом в тактическом ядерном оружии, мы можем сразу же уничтожить все их основные военные базы, промышленные предприятия, производящие вооружения, электростанции, мосты. В итоге вся их военная инфраструктура будет разрушена. И как они будут воевать? Что, они пешком к нам придут, особенно зимой? — Но есть же системы ПРО, много всего у них есть. — Это все сказки. — А как же концепция одновременного глобального удара ? — Глобального удара? Ну, это тоже глупость, раздутая военными экспертами, которые пытаются посеять в обществе ажиотаж. Потому что американцам, если смотреть на вещи реально, нечем наносить молниеносный глобальный удар. Их крылатые ракеты в обычном оснащении — ""Томагавк"" — имеют дальность 1500 километров. Откуда они будут их запускать, если на карту посмотреть? Ну, по границам нашего государства они еще смогут удары нанести. На Украине они их поставить по договору о ракетах средней и меньшей дальности не имеют права, в Польше тоже. Они могут их в Балтийском и Черном морях разместить, но там все простреливается нашими системами противокорабельной обороны. Молниеносный глобальный удар — это сказка, его невозможно нанести при нынешнем уровне технологий, которые имеются у США. Военные теоретики, конечно, обсуждают, как может протекать та или иная форма военного конфликта между нами и Западом. Это правильно, потому что, к сожалению, администрация Обамы ведет себя непредсказуемо. Но военные мыслят предельно конкретно, стратегически они не мыслят. Вот, например, некоторые предлагают сейчас ввести над Сирией бесполетную зону . Запад сможет сбивать наши самолеты. А мы обещаем сбивать их. На Западе считают, допустим, что у них там больше баз и они собьют все наши самолеты. Но мы же не оставим это дело просто так, мы атакуем их в Прибалтике, где у нас стратегическое преимущество. Пара наших дивизий пройдут ее за один день и прикончат их единственную бригаду. — Но наша концепция не предусматривает превентивного ядерного удара, только удар ответный. А у американцев как раз концепция превентивного ядерного удара… — Я немножко проясню ситуацию… У нас действительно была концепция ответного удара, только это было во времена Брежнева, когда мы обладали существенным военным превосходством над НАТО в Европе. Тогда у нас не было необходимости наносить первыми ядерный удар. Теперь ситуация кардинально поменялась: у НАТО больше ресурсов в Европе. И если они начнут наступление, то наша концепция предусматривает первый ядерный удар тактическим ядерным оружием. Это записано черным по белому в нашей военной доктрине. Что же касается Запада, то ему как раз невыгодно использование тактического ядерного оружия, поэтому он и призывает отказаться от него. Поэтому и Обама сейчас заговорил, как Брежнев: мы берем на себя обязательство не использовать ядерное оружие первыми. — Зато в ы сейчас заговорили, как Рональд Рейган… — Да, как говорил НАТО. У НАТО во времена ""холодной войны"" была концепция гибкого реагирования. Она предусматривала, что при наступлении наших войск на Западную Европу они будут применять тактическое ядерное оружие. Фактически, мы эту концепцию адаптировали к нашим условиям. Ситуация зеркально поменялась, и поэтому у них нет шансов в случае войны в Европе. — Но некие генералы в США все равно утверждают, что война с Россией будет быстрой, смертоносной и почти неизбежной. — Мне бы хотелось посмотреть, как они собираются это все осуществить, какими ресурсами, куда будут нанесены удары… Пусть они объяснят, как за две недели разгромят Россию. Гитлер тоже за два месяца рассчитывал развалить Советский Союз. Но у него хоть было какое-то ""рациональное зерно"". Он рассчитывал, что жители СССР настолько ненавидят большевистский режим, что при первом мощном ударе он просто рухнет. Сейчас же все наоборот: вся нация сплочена вокруг президента . Посмотрите, какие у него рейтинги поддержки. Особенно когда президент проявляет политическую волю, действует решительно, как в Крыму и Сирии. Если он, допустим, захочет свергнуть киевский режим за то, что тот продолжает войну против Донбасса, я думаю, он получит в обществе еще большую поддержку. — Г ромкие разговоры по поводу того, что Россия оккупировала Донбасс, Крым, что люди там страдают, ведутся на уровне самых высоких международных организаций. Это тоже проявление ""цивилизационного разлома""? — Это только говорит о том, что наше вступление в эти международные организации было ошибкой. Я лично, например, давно выступаю за выход России из ПАСЕ, Совета Европы. Это настоящие русофобские организации, и присутствие в них — глупость несусветная. С Западом у нас сейчас открытый конфликт, но он, в общем-то, был всегда. Рецидивы прозападной линии, начатой Горбачевым и продолженной Ельциным, еще сидят в мозгах. В конце концов, во Франции еще в 1812 году писали, что русские детей едят. Ну, пусть продолжают писать. Зачем вообще обращать на это внимание? — То есть, нам вообще надо отойти от всего мира? — Почему от всего мира? Только от Запада. Вот Индия не член ПАСЕ, Китай не член ПАСЕ, Иран не член ПАСЕ. Вообще, Европа — это географическое понятие. Николай Данилевский вообще утверждал, что понятие ""Европа"" — понятие географическое, но не цивилизационное. Есть западная цивилизация, есть православная цивилизация. Мы — православная цивилизация и от западной отличаемся. К этому выводу пришли все наши великие мыслители. И это не просто конфликт между православием и католицизмом как направлениями христианства. Речь идет о конфликте между православной цивилизацией, ядром которой является русская нация, и западной цивилизацией — полицентричной, но объединенной общими ценностями. Этот цивилизационный конфликт неизбежен, он был, есть и будет продолжаться. Другое дело — в каких формах. Участвуя в работе разных европейских институтов, мы что, рассчитываем сами вступить в западную цивилизацию? Но для этого мы должны отказаться от своей цивилизационной сущности, подделаться под них, признать однополые браки, феминизм и все остальное только потому, что все это ""западные ценности"". А зачем нам все это признавать? У нас своя собственная цивилизация, и мы должны развивать свои собственные принципы. Те же иранцы, которые от нас отстают очень существенно и в экономической, и в научно-технической сфере, или даже китайцы не преобразуют свою цивилизацию в западную. Почему мы должны преобразовывать? Мы, что, главные идиоты в мире? Культурные обмены — пожалуйста, контакты — пожалуйста, совместные научные исследования — пожалуйста. Но зачем вступать в организации, которые используются в качестве места, где нас постоянно порют, а если не порют, то поучают?

57-ой гумконвой доставил еду и медикаменты в республики Донбасса,"Фото: АР 
Как сообщили ТАСС в пресс-службе министерства, непредвиденных ситуаций в пути не возникло, доставка гуманитарных грузов прошла штатно. 
На российско-украинской границе в присутствии представителей таможенной и пограничной служб Украины все автомобили прошли досмотр. Была проверена не только техника, но и сопроводительные документы на гуманитарный груз. 
""Сейчас на складах начинается разгрузка автомобилей в присутствии представителей органов местного самоуправления, которые занимаются распределением гуманитарной помощи, в том числе по социально значимым объектам Луганской и Донецкой областей. Как только последняя машина будет разгружена, все автомобили сразу отправятся в Ростовскую область"", — сказал представитель МЧС. 
Этот гуманитарный конвой стал для Донбасса 57-й по счету с середины августа 2014 года. За этот период для жителей Луганской и Донецкой областей было доставлено уже свыше 64 тысяч тонн гуманитарной помощи, груз обычно разделяется примерно поровну между ДНР и ЛНР. 
Помощь России помогла Донбассу избежать гуманитарной катастрофы. Для жителей юго-востока Украины доставляются предметы первой необходимости, медикаменты и школьные учебники. 
Грузы традиционно проходят таможенное оформление в присутствии таможенной и пограничной служб Украины в соответствии с международным законодательством. Но несмотря на это, украинская сторона регулярно обвиняет Россию в том, что гумконвои вторгаются на украинскую территорию и нарушают правила. 
Ранее руководитель МЧС России Владимир Пучков заверил, что Россия продолжит оказывать гуманитарную помощь Донбассу ""столько, сколько потребуется"". Об этом он рассказал в интервью телекомпании НТВ. По словам Пучкова, этот вопрос уже полностью согласован.

"""Чем ближе мы к взятию Алеппо, тем яростнее Россию будут обвинять""","0 комментариев 0 поделились Фото: АР 
""Это трагедия. Если это было сделано намеренно, то это — военное преступление"", — цитирует AFP директора ЮНИСЕФ Энтони Лейка. В сообщении также употребляется слово ""нападение"". 
Как передает Reuters, ссылаясь на спасателей и мониторинговые группы, авиаудары были нанесены сирийской или российской авиацией. Однако СМИ Сирии об ударах по школе не сообщали. 
Насколько можно доверять этой информации, рассказал Pravda. Ru сотрудник Центра анализа стратегий и технологий Максим Шеповаленко. 
— Как воспринимать такую информацию? На Западе этому верят? 
— Очевидно, что это информационный вброс. Это будет продолжаться до конца войны, и я давно уже не обращаю на это внимания. Все пошло враздрай: никаких мирных переговоров, вступил в силу План Б — по вооружению боевиков. Значит, информационная война в самом разгаре. 
— Но ведь весь мир обвиняет российские и сирийские войска в причастности к этому, как надо реагировать? 
— Не надо оправдываться. Уже всем было сказано, что наши ВКС наносят удары на основе данных космической разведки, агентур, и с дополнительной доразведкой цели. Сколько это можно повторять? 
Всем очевидно, что чем ближе мы будем к взятию Алеппо, тем истеричнее и фантасмагоричнее будут все эти придумки и рассказы. Зачем наступать в расставленный силок? На мой взгляд, есть известный предел, до которого надо комментировать такие вещи. 
Ранее постоянный представитель РФ при ООН Виталий Чуркин отозвался о произошедшем как об ""ужасном"" событии, но деталей сообщить не смог. ""Мне проще всего сказать, что это не мы, но я ответственный человек, так что мне нужно подождать и посмотреть, что скажет наше министерство обороны"", — цитирует дипломата ТАСС. 
Напомним, Идлиб — провинция на северо-западе Сирии, граничит с провинцией Алеппо. Территорию Идлиба в 2015 году контролировала террористическая организация ""Джебхат ан-Нусра"" (запрещена в РФ), и самолеты российских ВКС наносили удары по этому региону. Вооруженное противостояние продолжается в Сирии с марта 2011 года. По данным ООН, за время конфликта погибли более 220 тысяч человек.

Путин рассказал липецкой фабрике Порошенко,"Фото: kremlin.ru 
Россия старается уважать право собственности, это касается и собственности Порошенко, подчеркнул российский лидер. 
""Мы стремимся к тому, чтобы уважать право собственности"", - сказал президент России, выразив согласие с известной позицией экс-министра финансов РФ Алексея Кудрина о том, что ""это один из столпов экономической политики"". ""У нас далеко не всегда так получается и нам практику нужно еще поправлять и в законодательстве многое еще нужно сделать, но мы всегда будем к этому стремиться"", - сказал глава государства. 
""То же самое касается и наших иностранных инвесторов, в том числе и украинских инвесторов. Петр Алексеевич Порошенко является одним из таких инвесторов, имея в виду, что он является собственником достаточно крупного предприятия в Липецкой области - фабрики ""Рошен"", - отметил Путин. 
Он обратил при этом внимание, что речь идет даже о двух предприятиях, одно из которых занимается реализацией продукции. ""Там есть и некоторые проблемы, связанные с невозвратом НДС и судебные органы ввели определенные ограничительные меры, - сказал Путин. - Но фабрика работает ритмично, выплачивает зарплату, получает прибыль и нет никаких ограничений, связанных с использованием этой прибыли, в том числе - и с переводом ее за границу"". Российский лидер также сказал, что не помнит точный размер этой прибыли, так как не погружается ""в такие детали"", но фабрика ""работает успешно"". 
Напомним, липецкая фабрика Порошенко пополнила бюджет России на $34 млн. По сравнению с предыдущим годом выплаты увеличились в 2,5 раза. 
Как сообщала Правда.Ру, во время предвыборной кампании украинский президент обещал, что продаст свои активы, в том числе, и кондитерскую фабрику в Липецке, однако пока эти обещания так и не выполнены.

Минобороны РФ: Видеокадры последствий удара по школе в Идлибе - монтаж,"0 комментариев 0 поделились Фото: AP 
Видеокадры, которыми подкрепляется эта информация, представляют собой видеомонтаж, склеенный из 10 разных видеоотрезков, снятых, к тому же, в разное время суток и с разным разрешением. Об этом заявил официальный представитель Минобороны генерал-майор Игорь Конашенков. 
По данным ведомства, для проверки информации ЮНИСЕФ российское военное ведомство тщательно проанализировало данные всех средств объективного контроля воздушной обстановки северной части Сирии. 
""Мы проанализировали фото и видеокадры якобы ""свидетельств"" разрушения школы. Опубликованные в ряде зарубежных СМИ видеокадры якобы нанесения удара по н. п. Хасс являются склейкой более 10 смонтированных отрезков, снятых с различным разрешением в разное время суток... В среду 26 октября ни один самолет ВКС России в данный район не заходил"", - сказал Конашенков. 
На опубликованной зарубежными СМИ фотографии видно, что повреждена только одна торцевая стена здания, причем все парты в классе стоят на своих местах, отметил он, а через пролом в стене отчетливо видно совершенно целое, без следов осколочных повреждений, ограждение розоватого цвета напротив, что невозможно при взрыве авиационного боеприпаса. 
""Ограда и все стены здания в этом случае должны были быть разрушены и посечены осколками, а мебель сметена ударной волной"", - пояснил Конашенков. 
Для подтверждения этой информации в четверг утром в район Хасса был направлен российский беспилотник. Аэрофотосъемка ВКС РФ, проведенная в районе якобы авиаудара по школе, установила отсутствие характерных повреждений для воздушных бомбардировок. 
""Как видно на фотографии с российского БПЛА, никаких повреждений крыши школы или воронок от взрыва авиабомб в прилегающем к школе районе нет... Кстати, аналогичные сведения могут быть запрошены у наших американских коллег"", - отметил представитель Минобороны. 
В это время в данном районе российскими средствами контроля воздушного пространства сопровождался американский разведывательно-ударный БПЛА MQ-1B Predator, отметил Конашенков. 
Напомним, как сообщала Правда.Ру, 26 октября в сирийской провинции Идлиб в результате авиаудара, который был нанесен по школе, погибли 22 ребенка и 6 учителей. 
«Это трагедия. Если это было сделано намеренно, то это - военное преступление»,- приводит AFP слова директора ЮНИСЕФ Энтони Лейка. До этого правозащитники сообщали, что «военные самолеты или российские, или сирийские нанесли шесть ударов» по деревне Хасс Лэйк отметил, что произошедшее является трагедией или военным преступлением. 
Официальный представитель МИД РФ Мария Захарова, заявила, что Россия не имеет никакого отношения к атаке на школу в сирийском Идлибе, и все международные институты должны срочно подключиться к расследованию этой трагедии. 
Чем ближе взятие Алеппо, тем яростнее будут обвинения в адрес России , считает сотрудник Центра анализа стратегий и технологий Максим Шеповаленко. Информационные вбросы, подобные истории об российском ударе по школе в провинции Идлиб , будут продолжаться до конца войны. ""Все пошло враздрай: никаких мирных переговоров, вступил в силу План Б - по вооружению боевиков. Значит, информационная война в самом разгаре"" - сказал аналитик в беседе с Pravda.Ru

"Вашингтон не выполняет своих обязательств по борьбе с ""Джебхат ан-Нусра""","Мир Ни взятые на себя обязательства по борьбе с террористической группировкой ""Джебхат ан-Нусра""*, ни обещания оказать влияние на представителей оппозиционных групп с целью соблюдения ими режима прекращения огня в САР так и не выполнены полностью США. Об этом говорится в распространенном в четверг документе с фактами выполнения РФ своих обязательств по договоренностям с США по Сирии и их нарушений Вашингтоном. 0 комментариев 0 поделились Разрушенный Алеппо. Фото: AP 
С текстом этого документа можно ознакомиться на сайте Министерства обороны России. Как ожидается, он будет внесен на рассмотрение в СБ ООН в Нью-Йорке в ближайшее время. 
В документе, в частности, указывается, что США не осуществляли в Сирии борьбу с признанной СБ ООН террористической группировкой ""Джебхат ан-Нусра"" и не предоставляли РФ полной информации о расположении боевиков этой группировки в САР, что затрудняло их отделение от представителей умеренной оппозиции. 
Вместо взятых на себя обязательств по организации гуманитарного доступа в г. Алеппо, США допустили заминирование силами оппозиции все подступы к Алеппо, а лидеры оппозиционных групп отказались пропустить гуманитарные конвои ООН. 
Из-за вполне определенных указаний из Вашингтона американские специалисты, прибывшие в Сирию для создания совместного исполнительного центра (СИЦ) России и США, целью которого является планирование совместных ударов по объектам «Джабхат ан-Нусры» и ИГИЛ, так и не приступили к работе. 
Также Вашингтон предоставил список из 138 умеренных оппозиционных групп, при этом две из них оказались принадлежащими к террористической группировке ИГ*, а 8 - к ""Джебхат ан-Нусре""*. 
28 июля 2016 года односторонним решением США прервали контакты по горячей линии между авиабазой Хмеймим группой своих политический и военных экспертов в Аммане (Иордания). 
Напомним, как сообщала Правда.Ру, о том, что российская сторона подготовила документ с фактами, подтверждающими выполнение Москвой взятых на себя обязательств по договоренностям в контексте мирного урегулирования в Сирии и невыполнение этих обязательств Вашингтоном, который Россия намерена распространить в СБ ООН, сегодня в ходе брифинга сообщила официальный представитель МИД России Мария Захарова. 
Сделано это будет для того, чтобы прекратить постоянные инсинуации на на тему о том, что РФ не выполняет свои обязательства в контексте мирного плана по Сирии.

"Путин высказал все, что он думает о Трампе","0 комментариев 7 поделились 
""Это полный бред и полная чушь, это просто способ внутриполитической борьбы, способ манипулирования общественным мнением накануне президентских выборов в самих Соединенных Штатах"", - сказал Путин. 
По мнению российского лидера, образ предпочтительности Трампа для России создан СМИ не случайно. ""Я вообще редко вижу, когда что-то случайно создается ведущими СМИ, - сказал Путин. - Эта сама идея вброшена в общественное сознание в ходе президентской кампании США, на мой взгляд, только с одной целью - с целью борьбы тех, кто защищает кандидата Демократической партии госпожу Клинтон в борьбе с представителем Республиканской партии, в данном случае, в борьбе с господином Трампом"". 
Глава государства напомнил слушателям о том, как работает эта схема. Сначала создается образ врага, которым назначается Россия, а потом Трамп объявляется ""российским фаворитом"". При этом, на самом деле, никто не может сказать, как в дальнейшем поведет себя кандидат, став президентом. Какие свои обещания он выполнит, а про какие просто забудет. 
""Поэтому, по большому счету, это для нас более менее безразлично, - сказал президент. - Но, конечно, мы не можем не приветствовать слова, мысли, намерения, в которых публично говорится о нормализации отношений между США и Россией"". 
Подобного рода риторика приветствуется вне зависимости от того, от какой из сторон она исходит, подчеркнул Владимир Путин. 
""Экстравагантность Трампа"", по мнению президента России, это хорошо продуманный политический шаг. ""Что касается самого господина Трампа - он выбрал свой способ достучаться до сердец избирателей, - сказал президент. - Он, конечно, ведет себя экстравагантно, мы все это видим, но, я думаю, что не так уж это все бессмысленно"". 
Республиканец Трамп, считает Владимир Путин, сегодня представляет интересы значительной части американского общества, которое устало о тех самых элит, которые десятилетиями находятся у власти. 
""Он просто представляет интересы таких вот простых людей и сам изображает из себя такого простого парня, который критикует тех, кто десятилетиями находится у власти, тех, кому не нравится передача власти по наследству"", - пояснил свою точку зрения глава государства. 
Президент добавил, что насколько такая стратегия эффективна, покажут выборы в ближайшее время. При этом он в очередной раз повторил, что российские власти будут работать с любым президентом, которого выберет американский народ и который захочет сотрудничать с Россией. 
Вмешательство в избирательную систему одной страны другим государством, в том числе, с помощью кибератак, недопустимо, сказал российский лидер, отвечая на вопрос о кибератаках, направленных на избирательные системы за рубежом. 
""Вмешательство во внутриполитические процессы одной страны в другой недопустимы вне зависимости от того, каким способом такие попытки могут предприниматься - с помощью кибератак, либо с помощью каких-то других инструментов, подконтрольных организаций внутри той или другой страны"", уверен президент России. 
Напомним, сегодня глава государства принимает участие в итоговой пленарной сессии XIII ежегодного заседания Международного дискуссионного клуба ""Валдай"". Тема заседания в этом году - ""Будущее начинается сегодня: контуры завтрашнего мира"".

Ученые сделали аккумулятор нового поколения похожим на кишечник,"0 комментариев 0 поделились Фото: АР 
В журнале Advanced Functional Materials, сотрудники Кембриджского университета и Пекинского технологического института рассказали, что принцип работы аккумулятора напоминает функционирование тонкого кишечника человека. 
Разработка заключается в том, что серосодержащий катод отделен от электролита специальной мембраной, которая по структуре напоминает волокна, находящиеся в тонкой кишке. Этот слой из волокон оксида цинка способен захватывать фрагменты активного вещества и присоединять их к проводящей решетке. Что и позволяет использовать повторно материалы аккумулятора, которые ранее были подвергнуты разрушению. 
""Удельная энергия литий-серной батареи превосходит в пять раз удельную энергию литий-ионной, которая используется в большинстве портативных устройств"", - рассказал автор исследования Дэн Чжао. 
Однако, по его словам, новая разработка пока не способна пройти через большое количество циклов зарядки-разрядки. 
Напомним, первые телефоны использовали никель-кадмиевые (Ni-Cd) аккумуляторы. Но несмотря на свои плюсы вроде большого ресурса и высокой токоотдачи, они обладали низкой удельной емкостью (45-65 Втч/кг). 
Эти причины заставили отказаться от Ni-Cd-аккумуляторов в пользу никель-металл-гидридных (Ni-MH) батарей. Они меньше подвержены эффекту памяти и имеют большую удельную емкость (60-72 Втч/кг). Однако срок хранения таких аккумуляторов примерно 200-500 циклов. 
Далее изобрели литий-ионный аккумулятор (Li-Ion), который остается остается одними из самых распространенных. Он имеет удельную емкость до 240 Втч/кг, что в несколько раз больше, чем у предшественников. Срок службы составляет более 600 циклов. Популярностью также обладают литий-полимерный аккумулятор (Li-Po). Эти аккумуляторы появились более 20 лет назад и до сих пор используются в смартфонах. 
Одной из самых последних разработок стали литий-серные (Li-S) аккумуляторы. Их энергоемкость вдвое превышает литий-ионных, также они выдерживают хороший срок службы (1,5 тыс. циклов заряда). Однако необходимость доработки и тестов в условиях влажности и температуры пока не дают выйти Li-S-аккумуляторам на рынок.

Курды разрубят ближневосточный узел,"Мир » Азия » Ближний Восток Ближний Восток превратился в самую большую мировую головоломку, части которой уже никогда не сойдутся в изначальный рисунок. Потому что региональная специфика, помноженная на западные амбиции, приводит к полному провалу и неразберихе, которые мы имеем сегодня в Сирии. И пока Америка в предвыборной агонии усиленно разбрасывается грязным бельем, мы рассмотрим вектор развития российско-турецких отношений, на фоне сирийского конфликта вкупе с западными потугами сохранить демократический имидж. 0 комментариев 0 поделились Фото: AP 
Сделать это, скажу я вам, непросто, потому что политические перипетии — и так явление не для слабонервных, но когда в одном котле замешаны Россия, Турция, США, полуразвалившаяся Сирия, курды, Европа, ИГИЛ (запрещенная в России террористическая организация. — Ред. ) и т. д., то здесь одной статьей не обойтись… 
Начнем с крайней обеспокоенности Анкары по поводу активной поддержки курдов Вашингтоном. И обеспокоенность эта столь велика, что подталкивает Турцию к военному сотрудничеству с Москвой. Вплоть до того, что некоторые российские политики на радостях наивно предположили, что Турция выйдет из НАТО. Это вполне характерно для российско-турецких отношений, когда из полной безоговорочной ""эйфории"" катастрофически безнадежных отношений впадаем в эйфорию чуть ли не идеальных. Но это лишь крупный план нового витка взаимодействия России и Турции, а на заднем плане можно рассмотреть много моментов, которые остаются за кадром. 
Мы знаем, что в данный момент действия Турции в Сирии совместно с сирийской свободной армией продолжаются, пусть и не так активно, как в начале операции. На то есть две причины. Во-первых, Турцию в Сирии жестко контролируют США, а во-вторых, она уже подходит к тем стратегическим точкам, где ИГИЛ держится намного крепче (например, Эль-Баб), чем в других районах, откуда они уже ушли. Что касается города Дабыка, то это отдельная история, имеющая для ИГИЛ особый идеологический характер, так как, по исламской религии, священный бой между мусульманами и неверными должен пройти именно в этом населенном пункте. И то, по последней информации, Дабык уже находится под контролем Турции совместно со свободной сирийской армией (что-то очень быстро закончился священный бой). 
Также Запад четко обозначил, что не хочет участия Турции в операциях по спасению Ракии и Мосула. Одним словом, без слез на все эти рокировки не взглянешь. Еще пару месяцев назад действия Турции в регионе были ограничены из-за России, но уже сегодня свобода действий наступила благодаря России. И все это вопреки воле военного союза, в котором Турция находится. Турция осталась вне игры на Ближнем Востоке из-за России, но и вернулась она туда благодаря той же России. И то, что сегодня она может остаться вне игры уже из-за США, кардинально меняет дело. А такие опасения на сей счет не безосновательны. И если Турция будет сопротивляться, ей, очевидно, это дорого обойдется, и тут даже Россия не сможет помочь. 
По сути, для Турции ничего не меняется, то она была заложницей ситуации с Россией, то сейчас она может стать заложницей ситуации с США. А за всем этим стоит только одна проблема — вечный конфликт с курдами и нежелание решить этот вопрос в рамках общепринятых демократических основ. Нам не раз приходилось наблюдать, что курдская проблема подталкивает Турцию на необдуманные поступки и действия. Особенно когда курды выходят за локальные рамки в надежде на поддержку извне. А когда сама Хиллари Клинтон на почти решающих предвыборных дебатах открыто заявляет, что будет поставлять оружие и поддерживать курдов в регионе (а это значит, что вопрос разделения Сирии пока еще открыт) и когда весь Запад, так или иначе, делает ставки на курдов, — это, конечно, не может не отразиться на поведении Эрдогана. 
В связи с этим Эрдоган решил поменять свою риторику в отношении Асада. И отнюдь не только из-за того, что на этом настаивает Россия и чтобы угодить ей. Мы должны понять, что Турция сделала это, чтобы проучить США. Если быть честными, то все понимают, что экономические отношения между нашими странами имеют обоснованные причины, а политическое сближение чаще всего строится на противоречиях с другими странами. 
Проучить Америку Турция страстно желает из-за Гюлена, которого Вашингтон отказывается выдавать, и из-за активной поддержки США курдов в регионе. Как только эти обстоятельства изменятся, изменится и все остальное… Еще одно раздражающее Эрдогана явление — это невозможность уследить за переменчивыми настроениями США. То Америка поддерживает иракских курдов во главе с Барзани, то теперь РПК. То она хочет, чтобы именно Турция участвовала в операциях под Мосулом и Раккой, то, наоборот, считает, что Турция там вообще не нужна. И это не что иное, как стремление к деморализации Эрдогана. 
А в целом, все, что сегодня происходит с курдами в регионе, сбивает с толку многих, кому судьба курдов небезразлична. И многие россияне, в том числе, ровным счетом не понимают регионального расклада по курдам. То курды были, так сказать, в топе в России и были чуть ли не главной темой после Асада, то вновь канули в историческое и информационное небытие. При этом надо понимать, что все эти скачкообразные противоречивые процессы чисто конъюнктурные. И никто не знает, чем все это закончится. Ясно одно: в ближневосточном регионе ничего уже не будет, как прежде. И по той же логике — как не будет единственного выигравшего, так же и единственного проигравшего. И тех и других будет несколько. Понятия победы и поражения в контексте Сирии — явления коллективные. И выиграют, скорее всего, те, кто возьмет в свою команду курдов. 
При этом все понимают: как бы ни сложились обстоятельства, нужен консенсус между ведущими и второстепенными игроками. Почему консенсус? Да потому, что или консенсус, или третья мировая война. И это надо делать пока не пройдена точка невозврата. И еще потому, что, наверное, никому не захочется остаться наедине с экономическими и социальными последствиями этой разрушительной войны. Хотя обострение отношений между крупными державами, скорее всего, продолжится до выборов в США, а потом пойдет на спад, как это не раз было в истории. 
Но при условии, если бы год назад Россия взяла под свой полный контроль не только Асада, но и курдов (ведь в Сирии есть две реальные силы — это Асад и курды) и вплотную занялась строительством хотя бы маленькой военной базы и сопутствующих инфраструктур, которые сейчас вместо России вполне успешно возводят Соединенные Штаты в сирийском Курдистане, то вообще бы никаких вопросов не возникло. Сейчас американцы либо помалкивали бы в тряпочку, либо тихо ретировались в сторону Ирака. А сегодня момент упущен и, увы, придется с американцами считаться. 
Высоцкий пел: ""Как мы место шаха проворонили… Нам этого потомки не простят"". Скорее всего, на тот момент Россия не хотела раздражать ни Тегеран, ни Анкару, ни Дамаск. Я считаю, что Россия этот тонкий момент с курдами пропустила зря. И в этом случае с Турцией сегодня все было бы так же хорошо, как сейчас. И даже лучше, потому что и Москва, и Анкара, в отличие от США, реально заботятся о территориальной целостности Сирии. Именно поэтому на данном этапе такой расклад устраивал бы всех. 
В сложившейся ситуации курдам все равно, конечно, но России и Турции было бы приятнее, если бы в свой совместный союз они смогли включить курдов. Тогда я был бы спокоен за дальнейшую судьбу российско-турецких отношений. Как я говорил неоднократно, непредсказуемость турецкой внешней политики (на что очень часто жалуются в России) кроется именно в нерешенности курдского вопроса. Хотя все еще не поздно. Вернее, лучше поздно, чем никогда.

Президент Путин ответил на критику Запада по поводу Алеппо,"0 комментариев 14 поделились Фото: kremlin.ru 
""Хотел бы отреагировать на абсолютно правильные вещи: колокола в Финляндии звонят по погибшим в Алеппо. Ну давайте позвоним сейчас по погибшим в районе Мосула, где сейчас начинается операция (иракских сил при поддержке коалиции США — прим. ВЗГЛЯД). Там уже более 200 человек, по-моему, террористы расстреляли в надежде остановить наступление на город"", — сказал Путин, выступая на итоговой пленарной сессии Международного дискуссионного клуба ""Валдай"". 
Путин также напомнил, что в Афганистане, например, ""одним ударом авиация уничтожала целые свадьбы"". ""А что сейчас происходит в Йемене? На мой взгляд, колокола должны звонить по всем этим безвинным жертвам"", — добавил он. 
""Мы все время слышим: Алеппо, Алеппо, Алеппо… Ну да. Вопрос в чем? Или оставить там террористическое гнездо, или, минимизируя, делая все, чтобы избежать жертв среди мирного населения все-таки это гнездо дожать. Если не нужно ничего трогать, то не нужно наступать и на Мосул. Давайте все оставим как есть. Давайте Ракку не будем трогать. Ведь мы все время слышим от наших западных партнеров: ""Нужно наступать на Ракку, нужно уничтожить это гнездо терроризма. Но в Ракке тоже живут мирные граждане. Мы не будем с террористами бороться вообще? Вот когда они где-то в городах захватывают заложников, мы что, оставляем их в покое? Возьмите пример с Израиля, Израиль никогда так не делает, благодаря чему и существует. Да и выбора другого нет. Надо бороться. Если мы постоянно будем сдавать позиции, мы всегда будем проигрывать"", — заявил президент. 
По мнению российского лидера, единый фронт борьбы с терроризмом не созда н. ""На примере террористической опасности со всей очевидностью проявляется неспособность оценить характер, причины возникновения и нарастания угроз. Мы видим это по тому, как развивается ситуация в Сирии, остановить кровопролитие и запустить политический процесс не удается. Казалось бы, после долгих переговоров, огромных усилий и сложных компромиссов наконец начал формироваться единый фронт борьбы с терроризмом, однако этого не произошло, он, фактически, не создан"", — сказал российский лидер. 
Напомним, сегодня глава государства принимает участие в итоговой пленарной сессии XIII ежегодного заседания Международного дискуссионного клуба ""Валдай"". Тема заседания в этом году — ""Будущее начинается сегодня: контуры завтрашнего мира"".

"Российский биолог стал победителем конкурса Science, ""станцевав свою диссертацию""","0 комментариев 1 поделились Источник: http://open-look.ru 
Танец Согорина рассказывает о сходстве бальных танцев с синтезом белка в клетках человеческого тела. Следуя правилам конкурса, автор диссертации сам принимал участие в выступлении. 
Всего в конкурсе приняли участие 12 ученых. Гран-при получил британский биоинженер Джейкоб Бруберт, рассказавший танцем историю создания искусственных сердечных клапанов. 
Напомним, конкурс ""Станцуй свою диссертацию"" был организован научным журналистом Джоном Боханноном в 2007 году. Все победители получают денежные призы. Гран-при составляет тысячу долларов, приз победителям номинаций — 500 долларов. 
Ранее Pravda.Ru писала, что правительство РФ выделит 28 миллиардов рублей на программу привлечения ведущих ученых в российские образовательные и научные организации до 2020 года. По словам премьер-министра РФ Дмитрия Медведева, гранты получают те, кто готов воплощать свои идеи в нашей стране вместе с командами российских специалистов. 
Главная цель программы — сделать российские вузы и научные центры местом притяжения для исследователей со всего мира и привлечь обратно в страну российских ученых, которые в предыдущие годы уехали работать за границу. 
По словам Дмитрия Медведева, интерес программой со стороны мирового научного сообщества большой. Было подано почти три тысячи заявок учеными из более чем 45 стран. Среди победителей есть лауреаты Нобелевской премии и других престижных наград. 
Ранее Минобрнауки опровергло слухи о грядущем сокращении финансирования научной госпрограммы, массовых сокращениях преподавателей вузов и бюджетных мест. 
""У Министерства нет никаких планов по сокращению ученых и научных сотрудников. С 2016 года были удвоены выплаты академикам и членам-корреспондентам государственных академий наук, в 2017 году указанный уровень выплат будет сохранен"", — сказала журналистам директор департамента информационной политики министерств Анна Усачева. 
По словам главы департамента, среднемесячная заработная плата ученых, занятых исследованиями и разработками, за последние три года выросла более чем на 33%, при этом показатель среднемесячной зарплаты всех работников научной сферы по сравнению с 2012 годом вырос на 21,5%. Минобрнауки считает приоритетной задачу увеличения объема бюджетных средств, выделяемых для финансирования науки, и количества сотрудников университетов и НИИ.

Выкинуть хлам и жить по фэншуй,"Общество » Практика » Как отдохнуть Как изменить жизнь к лучшему с помощью фэншуй? Как организовать домашнее пространство так, чтобы вещи работали на ваше благо? Почему специалисты по фэншуй против стеклянных столов и с осторожностью относятся к зеркалам? В какую сторону света все же лучше спать головой? Секреты фэншуй для Pravda.Ru раскрыла мастер фэншуй Татьяна Мизгирева. 0 комментариев 1 поделились 
— Фэншуй — это наука? 
— Да, фэншуй - это наука. Но это не наука с точки зрения какой-то западной доказательной базы, это наука с точки зрения восточного взгляда. Разные школы фэншуй, традиции, передачи развивались тысячелетиями - и развивались за счет наблюдений. У каждой из них создалась огромная накопительная статистическая база. То есть, когда что-то одно повторяется десять раз, вы думаете, что в этом есть какая-то закономерность. Но если сто, тысячу раз этот эффект повторился, то это уже можно назвать научной статистикой, но в восточном ключе. 
— Давайте рассмотрим домашнее пространство. Начнем с прихожей. Какие ошибки чаще всего делают люди в оформлении своей прихожей? Каких вещей там не должно быть в принципе, а какие вещи или цвета, наоборот, благоприятно влияют на жизнь хозяев этой квартиры? 
— Самая частая и распространенная ошибка — это расположение зеркала напротив входной двери, в особенности если прихожая небольшая. Если прихожая огромная и где-то вдали находится зеркало, то это не так страшно. Но если у нас от входной двери до ближайшей стены напротив полтора-два метра и сразу же висит зеркало, то это будет серьезно обесточивать квартиру. Потому что зеркало на сто процентов отталкивает все входящие воздушные потоки, а с ними и жизненно важную энергию Ци, которая приходит вместе с потоками воздуха. Таким образом, квартира обесточивается, и это проявляется в жизни людей, возникают проблемы, такие как трудности в получении работы, новых проектов, невозможность реализовать себя, трудности в общении. Как будто бы пространство стоит спиной к нам, и вся жизнь отвернулась, и все приходит с колоссальным трудом. 
Стоит только убрать это зеркало и перевесить его таким образом, чтобы оно перенаправляло вглубь квартиры все эти воздушные потоки, и можно почувствовать сразу же, в течение нескольких дней, что жизнь кардинальным образом поменяется. Как будто все снова повернулось к вам лицом и начинает помогать. Это очень важно. 
Еще одна ошибка, которую очень часто можно встретить в прихожих, - это недостаточно яркий свет. Все-таки прихожая — это так называемая ""янская зона"". Там должна быть сильная активность, и там должен быть яркий свет. Нужно не поскупиться на хорошую лампочку, которая будет все хорошо освещать. Известно, что яркий свет привлекает яркие, сильные энергии. 
Также в прихожей надо добавить простора. То есть чем менее заставлена входная зона, тем легче воздушным потокам войти в квартиру и наполнить ее. 
Кроме того, хорошо здесь использовать какие-то позитивные красивые символы — то, с чем мы бы хотели отождествляться. Потому что когда мы входим в квартиру, мы видим первый символ, с которым мы отождествляемся. И если мы входим и перед нами, например, находится картина ""Иван Грозный убивает своего сына"", то это посылает определенные импульсы, это то, чего следовало бы избегать. 
— Теперь предлагаю поговорить о гостиной. Это место, где отдыхает вся семья, собирается вечерами, общается, смотрит телевизор. Какие предметы будут благоприятно влиять на людей в гостиной? 
— Я бы сказала, что здесь нет какой-то одной общей рекомендации. Это зависит и от того, в какую сторону света смотрит гостиная, и какие люди там живут. Это очень индивидуально. Главное, чтобы это было комфортно для людей. 
Другие рекомендации, которые я могла бы дать, - это то, что здесь надо избегать обилия острых углов, которые были бы направлены на диванную группу, или нависающих полок. Мне встречались такие квартиры, где стоит диван и над ним висят тяжелые полки. Конечно, в таком месте особо сильно не расслабишься и не восстановишься, потому что то, что нависает, будет давить и бессознательно вызывать чувство угнетения. 
Еще часто в гостиной располагают перед диваном или креслами журнальный столик, на который можно поставить какие-то угощения или еще что-то. И стало очень модным использовать стеклянные столы. Это тоже не очень хорошо, потому что мы знаем, что стеклянная поверхность может разбиться. Поэтому всякий раз, когда мы ставим что-либо на этот стеклянный стол и слышим стеклянный звук, то у нас возникает легкий спазм в теле. И, таким образом, мы не расслабляемся, а продолжаем оставаться в напряжении. А ведь гостиная — это то место, где бы мы хотели отдохнуть. Поэтому я советую либо не использовать такие столы, либо если такой стол уже есть, то можно просто покрыть его непрозрачной скатертью или чем-то еще. 
— Довольно часто в магазинах можно встретить небольшие деревца, на которых висят монетки, и считается, что это принесет финансовое благополучие в дом. Некоторые люди считают необходимым в своей гостиной разместить такое дерево. Как оно в действительности будет влиять на жизнь владельцев квартиры? 
— Само по себе дерево — это сувенир с монетами. Использование этих сувениров дома и в офисах — это китайское наследие. И, на самом деле, его предназначение в том, чтобы напоминать своему хозяину о его цели, чтобы он активно действовал в направлении достижения своих финансовых задач. 
Мы можем расположить такое деревце с монетами рядом с пышным растением. И хорошо будет, если мы поставим рядом, например, декоративный фонтанчик или водопадик, потому что именно эти предметы будут активно создавать энергию. Растения за счет своего роста продуцируют янскую энергию, а фонтанчик создает ее за счет циркуляции воды, что также создает избыток кислорода в этом месте. 
И если мы поставим это дерево с монетами, то мы, таким образом, поставим в нашей квартире маркер, что для меня благосостояние — это важно и я хочу, чтобы энергия направилась в этом русле. И тогда, всякий раз видя эту композицию, у нас будет запускаться процесс мышления: ""А что же нужно сделать для того, чтобы это благосостояние пришло в мою жизнь?"" И оно будет напоминать нам и толкать нас в этом направлении, чтобы мы были более активными в достижении того, что нам нужно в жизни. 
— То есть цветы в доме — это хорошо не только с точки зрения насыщения кислородом, но и с точки зрения фэншуй? 
— Да, конечно. Тем более, есть даже специальные сектора в комнатах, которые полезны для того, чтобы там были растения, чтобы более активная энергия усиливалась. А такие растения, у которых есть цветущие бутоны, или срезанные цветы в определенных местах усиливают романтическую удачу. И это ценно для тех, кто хочет обрести счастливое партнерство. 
— Наверное, все мы хотим, чтобы дома был порядок, но за неимением большого количества свободного времени довольно часто порядок превращается в беспорядок. В результате мы имеем завалы вещей и на стульях, и на открытых полках. Как это влияет на жизнь человека? Это просто некрасиво визуально или это еще способно вызывать какие-то негативные события? 
— В каком-то смысле да. Наше внешнее пространство отражает, во-первых, наше внутреннее состояние, и мы это также потом проецируем в мир. То есть если бардак чрезмерный, то он создает и некое хаотичное мышление, и проецируется на наши события в жизни. Живем мы так же хаотично, без какого-то планирования, бесконтрольно. И тут уже все зависит от талантов человека, от того, как он может управляться с этим хаосом в своей жизни. 
Еще важно, чтобы предметы, которыми мы пользуемся, были более-менее в движении. То есть какие-то хаотичные завалы, конечно, не хороши, но если еще человек этим не пользуется, и оно просто лежит как груда, то это как тромб. А это значит, что где-то внутри в жизни есть какой-то тромб, потому что внешнее и внутреннее неразделимо, все связано. Поэтому важно, чтобы мы пользовались тем, что у нас есть. Если мы не пользуемся, то, возможно, это просто не нужно, это нужно куда-то переместить, продать, выбросить. 
— Давайте перейдем к спальне. Это место, где мы отдыхаем, где мы проводим много часов подряд, когда спим. Очень много споров идет о том, в какую сторону лучше спать головой. Есть какие-то рекомендации? 
— Да, конечно, они существуют, но, к сожалению, я не могу дать одного общего совета. Я часто слышу, что головой нужно спать только на север или только на восток. Это абсолютная неправда. Люди индивидуальны, и каждому человеку соответствует несколько благоприятных направлений и несколько неблагоприятных. Это можно прочувствовать интуитивно. 
Какая здесь возникает чаще всего проблема? Человек ставит кровать каким-то классическим, традиционным способом, но чувствует себя некомфортно, неуютно, не высыпается, ворочается или ему снятся плохие сны. Это признак того, что данное место, или направление, или и место, и направление не подходят этому человеку. Тогда нужно попытаться найти какое-то нешаблонное решение. Может быть, переставить кровать в другое место, или даже иногда эту кровать стоит поставить под углом, защитив тыльную часть кровати, чтобы она не смотрела в пустой угол. То есть нужно проявить креативность, послушать свою интуицию, чтобы найти это хорошее место. И тело обязательно сообщит об этом, вы легко почувствуете, что так спать гораздо лучше, комфортнее, вы лучше засыпаете, легче просыпаетесь, нужно будет меньше времени, чтобы выспаться и т.д. 
Не рекомендуют располагать в спальне зеркала. Если есть все-таки острая необходимость, то желательно повесить зеркала таким образом, чтобы человек, лежа на кровати, не видел своего отражения. На самом деле, это может немного пугать во сне, когда ты просыпаешься, встаешь и видишь свое отражение. И вообще, какие-то блики, силуэты, тени, лучи на зеркалах могут просто тревожить. Потом, зеркала создают объем, дополнительное измерение, и тоже во время сна это может беспокоить. 
— Коснемся наиболее важных сфер нашей жизни — это здоровье, карьера, финансовое благополучие и личные взаимоотношения. Дайте, пожалуйста, короткие рекомендации, что сделать, чтобы во всех сферах жизнь стала немножечко лучше. 
— Что касается здоровья, должно быть больше энергии в квартире или в доме. Для этого квартира должна хорошо проветриваться, не быть захламленной. 
Если говорить о романтической удаче, о партнерстве, то важно следить за тем, что если у нас есть сложности в этом, чтобы в квартире не было каких-то одиноких символов: изображений одинокой тоскующей дамы или, опять же, картины ""Иван Грозный убивает своего сына"". Таких изображений не должно быть. Напротив, нужно привнести в интерьер как можно больше партнерских символов, которые символизируют счастливые взаимоотношения: две свечи, две птицы, две кошечки. 
А что касается бизнеса, успеха, процветания, то полезно правильным образом расположить рабочий стол, за которым вы работаете. Расположение стола должно быть таким: за спиной должна быть стена, с левой стороны - какая-то защита, а перед нами - открытое пространство. Тогда у нас достаточно много фантазии, есть тыл за спиной, и мы гораздо лучше функционируем.

Дырка от рублика: Украина не получит штрафы с авиакомпаний РФ за полеты в Крым,"0 комментариев 1 поделились 
Как заявили в Государственной авиационной службе Украины (Госавиаслужба), в связи с нарушением запрета на полеты над полуостровом ведомство вынесло более пяти тысяч постановлений. 
Штрафы, в частности, были наложены на ""Аэрофлот"", после того как перевозчик запустил рейсы по маршруту Сочи — Симферополь. Представители Госавиаслужбы признались, что пока ни одна российская компания не заплатила требуемую от нее сумму. 
Насколько правомерны такие штрафы, Pravda.Ru поинтересовалась у генерального директора Ассоциации аэропортов гражданской авиации Виктора Горбачева. 
Эксперт заявил, что Россия не должна и не будет платить. ""Крым является российской территорией, какие могут быть штрафы? — объяснил он. — Более того, Россия не осуществляет полеты через Украину (российские летчики пролетают через Краснодарский край), соответственно, поводов производить выплаты нет абсолютно никаких"". 
По его словам, не стоит относиться к подобным требованиям серьезно: ""Они могут делать, что угодно, даже предъявить претензии к президенту. Ну, предъявляйте, а дальше что?"", — сказал собеседник Pravda.Ru. 
На вопрос о том, сможет ли Украина добиться выплат через международные инстанции, Виктор Горбачев пояснил, что у этих штрафов нет юридических, правовых оснований. ""Это проблема даже не Украины, а каких-то отдельных служб, деятелей. Украина может предъявлять все, что угодно, но это никак не повлияет на отсутствие правых оснований для выплат за полеты над российской территорией"", — заявил эксперт. 
При этом Виктор Горбачев напомнил, что один раз такое получилось, но не Украины, а у европейцев, когда те загубили нашу авиакомпанию ""Добролет"". ""В тот раз это была наша вина, и мы должны были понимать, чем это может обернуться"", — сказал эксперт. Он заверил, что теперь мы такого не допустим. 
Напомним, в сентябре 2014 года взамен подпавшего под санкции ЕС лоукостера ""Добролет"" ""Аэрофлот"" создал компанию ""Бюджетный перевозчик"", которая работает под брендом ""Победа"". При этом все руководящие должности были сохранены. 
Стопроцентная ""дочка"" ""Аэрофлота"" - ""Добролет"", в июне 2014 года начавшая деятельность с перелетов в Симферополь, была вынуждена прекратить работу 4 августа 2014 года из-за введенных против нее санкций ЕС. Ряд европейских контрагентов сообщили об отказе выполнять обязательства перед российским авиаперевозчиком, аннулировав действие договоров лизинга, технического обслуживания и страхования лайнеров, а также предоставления аэронавигационной информации.

В Екатеринбурге коллекторы избили пенсионерку,"0 комментариев 3 поделились Фото: АР 
Как сообщили ТАСС в пресс-службе надзорного ведомства, подробности дела уточняются. В ходе надзорных мероприятий прокуратура выяснит, в какой организации пожилая женщина взяла заем, и какой фактический долг установлен на текущий момент. Ведомство также оценит действия сотрудников коллекторского агентства на предмет соблюдения законодательства. 
Прокуратура взяла на контроль результаты доследственной проверки по факту нанесения телесных повреждений женщине. 
Угрозы и нападения коллекторов на Урале происходят не впервые. В августе коллекторы довели жительницу Челябинска до отравления уксусной кислотой из-за кредита в 732%. По словам уполномоченного по правам человека в Челябинской области, из-за угроз Фарида Ибрагимова отравилась уксусной кислотой и скончалась в больнице. 
""Равиля Ибрагимова и ее внучка Эльвира уже два года подвергаются давлению со стороны коллекторов. В июне 2014 года жительница Челябинска Фарида Ибрагимова в одной из местных микрофинансовых организаций взяла 5 тысяч рублей. Через две недели она должна была вернуть 6 500 рублей. Процентная ставка по кредиту составила 2% в день или 732% годовых. Погасить долг полностью Ибрагимова не смогла,"" — сообщает омбудсмен области Маргарита Павлова. 
После чего начались телефонные звонки с угрозами на телефон женщины, на домашний телефон матери, а затем и дочери Эльвире в социальных сетях начали поступать сообщения с угрозами. Несколько раз коллекторы стреляли по окнам квартиры Ибрагимовых. Семья трижды обращалась в правоохранительные органы, но в возбуждении уголовного дела им отказывали. 
В 2015 года Фарида попыталась покончить с собой, выпив 70% уксусную кислоту. Ибрагимова целый год провела в больнице, но поправиться не смогла. После смерти Фариды коллекторская фирма требует уже более 200 тысяч рублей у матери и дочери погибшей. 
Ранее Pravda.Ru писала, что вступление в силу закона, который обязывает коллекторов с 1 января 2017 года состоять в государственном реестре, могут отложить на полгода из-за того, что чиновники до сих пор не могут договориться с Минфином о выделении бюджетных средств на регулирование деятельности по взысканию долгов. Как сообщал ""Коммерсантъ"", работа по формированию реестра так и не начата, нет официально установленного перечня критериев, которым должны соответствовать участники рынка взыскания долгов. Минюст не сможет приступить к составлению списка, пока не выйдет соответствующее постановление правительства и на него не выделят деньги. 
Напомним, в июле Владимир Путин подписал закон о коллекторской деятельности. Документ устанавливает правовые основы деятельности по возврату просроченной задолженности граждан и порядок их взаимодействия с кредиторами и взыскателями долгов. 
Закон запрещает коллекторам применять физическую силу и угрожать ее применением, причинять вред здоровью и имуществу, оказывать психологическое давление и вводить в заблуждение. 
Звонить должнику коллектор сможет не чаще двух раз в неделю, а проводить личные встречи — не чаще одного раза в неделю. Общение с должником ночью — с 22.00 до 8.00 в будни и с 20.00 до 9.00 в выходные — запрещено. Взыскатель долгов при взаимодействии с должником не вправе скрывать информацию о номере телефона и адресе электронной почты, с которых он звонит и отправляет сообщения.

Путин: Запад постоянно наступает на одни и те же грабли,"0 комментариев 4 поделились 
""На примере террористической опасности со всей очевидностью проявляется неспособность оценить характер, причины возникновения и нарастания угроз.

Казалось бы, после долгих переговоров, огромных усилий и сложных компромиссов наконец начал формироваться единый фронт борьбы с терроризмом, однако этого не произошло, он, фактически, не создан"", - сказал российский лидер. 
Президент отметил, что примеры терактов последних лет (в том числе США и Франции) показывают - террористы могут действовать в одиночку. 
По его словам, люди напуганы тем, что терроризм из далекой угрозы стал повседневностью, что ""теракт может произойти буквально рядом, на соседней улице, если не на собственной улице, а орудием массового убийства способно стать любое подручное средство - от изготовленной кустарным способом взрывчатки до обычного грузовика"". 
В том же время Запад в противостоянию терроризму наступает на одни и те же грабли. 
""Не сработали и наши личные договоренности с президентом США. В Вашингтоне нашлись силы, которые сделали все, чтобы они - эти договоренности - не были реализованы на практике. Все это демонстрирует необъяснимое, я бы сказал, иррациональное стремление западных стран раз за разом повторять свои ошибки, как у нас в народе говорят, наступать на одни и те же грабли"", - заявил Путин. 
По словам российского лидера, любые вызовы можно преодолеть только сообща, на базе правил ООН. 
""Универсальные правила ООН необходимы, чтобы включить как можно большее число стран в процесс экономической и гуманитарной интеграции, гарантировать политическую ответственность и обеспечить согласованность действий, разумеется, при сохранении суверенитета"", - сказал Владимир Путин.

Мадрид сопротивлялся давлению Вашингтона, указывая, что процедура обслуживания военных кораблей России давно апробирована и прозрачна, но затем сдался. Скандал грозит Мадриду экономическими потерями. А России? 0 комментариев 16 поделились Поход, который всполошил НАТО 
15 октября корабельная авианосная группа Северного флота из Североморска начала поход в район Средиземного моря. В составе группы -авианесущий крейсер ""Адмирал Кузнецов"" , атомный ракетный крейсер ""Петр Великий"", противолодочные корабли ""Североморск"" и ""Вице-адмирал Кулаков"", а также корабли обеспечения. Через неделю всполошились британские таблоиды. Ссылаясь на анонимный источник в НАТО, газеты указывали, что через Гибралтар в Сирию идет эскадра в составе ""всего Северного флота и большей части Балтийского"". ""Атомные военные корабли Владимира Путина продвигаются к Ла-Маншу, а ВМС Великобритании готовятся поднять флот по тревоге"", — писала газета The Sun . Издание предупреждало, что российский флот может ""окружить"" Великобританию, и начало ""отсчет до третьей мировой"". 
Однако вскоре выяснилось, что это всего лишь группа кораблей и направляется она не к берегам Туманного Альбиона, а в Тартус для поддержки действий нашей авиагруппы в Сирии. Тут же поднялась другая волна возмущения тем, что эскадра должна зайти в испанский порт Сеута (на марроканском побережье) для дозаправки и отдыха. Как же так, высказывались западные политики, Испания — это член НАТО, она только что подписала заявление ЕС о ""военных преступлениях России в Сирии"". Что же она поощряет эти ""преступления""? 
Скандал нарастал, так как испанские власти не спешили реагировать, объясняя, что ведут со всеми сторонами консультации. Наконец, подтянулась тяжелая артиллерия. Министр обороны Великобритании Майкл Фаллон сказал, что он ""крайне обеспокоен тем, что страна НАТО рассмотрит вопрос об оказании помощи российскому флоту, который будет участвовать в бомбардировке мирных жителей в Сирии"". Была дана команда и в Испании. Так, парламентская группа Esquerra Republicana de Catalunya (ERC) попросила министров иностранных дел и обороны Хосе Мануэля Гарсия-Маргальо и Педро Моренеса объяснить ""возможное сотрудничество Испании с российскими фрегатами, которые принимали участие в военных операциях в Сирии"". Испания привыкла к страстям по Сеуте 
Речь не идет о тяжелых кораблях и авианосце, а всего лишь о трех кораблях сопровождения, оправдывался Моренес. И это ему было делать не впервой , потому что вопрос о том, что Сеута стала негласной базой российского флота, давно будоражит умы брюссельских депутатов и чиновников. ""В данном конкретном случае было предварительное разрешение, потому что цели кораблей не были четкими"", сказал Моренес. Тоже стандартная отговорка испанцев в отношении российских кораблей и подлодок. Министр добавил, что если подтвердится, что корабли направляются в Сирию, то разрешение будет отменено. МИД Испании со своей стороны подчеркнул, что подобные услуги не запрещены санкциями, введенными ЕС против России, так как они (услуги) ""оговариваются индивидуально с учетом характеристик судна и безопасности для окружающей среды, населения и самого порта и утверждены с полной прозрачностью, отчетностью перед союзниками"". 
Понятно, почему так неохотно отступала Испания. Обслуживание российских военных кораблей, пишет El Pais , ведется с 2010 года, это приносит Сеуте и бюджету ""огромные деньги"". Помимо прямой платы в казну за обслуживание, это еще примерно миллион евро в год из карманов моряков, сошедших на землю, подсчитала El Pais . Последние заходы российских кораблей в Сеуту были 16 октября, это были корветы ""Зеленый Дол"", ""Серпухов"" и буксир SB-36, пишет газета. 
Испания сдалась только после вызова Моренеса на ковер с генсеку НАТО Столтенбергу. ""Страны НАТО имеют право на самостоятельное решение по поводу того, пускать ли в свои порты российские корабли для дозаправки и пополнения запасов, но в данном случае я послал очень четкий сигнал: мы обеспокоены потенциальным участием авианосца ""Адмирал Кузнецов"" в боевых действиях в Сирии"", — сказал Столтенберг. Сразу же появилось сообщение от российского посла в Испании о том, что флотилия пересекла Гибралтарский пролив без остановки в Сеуте, так как ""был изменен путь следования"". Представитель минобороны России Игорь Конашенков сказал о предупреждении испанских властей, что заход российских кораблей в порт нецелесообразен из-за позиции НАТО. Мадрид и Москва будут искать варианты 
Есть впечатление, что Москва и Мадрид играют с НАТО в непонятки: мол, все успокоится, и мы все вернем на круги своя. Так, кстати, за шесть лет было не раз. Но сейчас на Мадрид могут нажать и посильнее. И он потеряет свою ""обычную практику"", но это его печаль. Печаль Москвы — найти новые порты для отдыха моряков и дозаправки на пути в Тартус. Конкретно эта эскадра не пострадает, она автономна в своем плавании на несколько недель, и можно подтянуть танкеры из Севастополя. Есть практика дозаправки на Мальте и в Греции. Мальта сегодня заявила, что не будет принимать эскадру, значит, вероятно, не будет и другие корабли, так как давление на Россию усиливается. Есть еще Греция. Посмотрим, что скажут там, поспешат ли делать заявления. 
Заметим, что Испания недавно на Совете Европы возражала против новых санкций в отношении России. Генеральный директор Торговой палаты Испании Инмакулада Риера заявила, что надеется на развитие сотрудничества в области инфраструктуры и транспорта ""из-за многочисленных проектов, которые правительство России развивает в этой области"", пишет La Vanguardia . Испания хочет сотрудничать с Россией, она истощена рецессией, ее аграрный сектор страдает от российского эмбарго, а в ответ слышатся угрозы со стороны Брюсселя о наложении санкций ЕС за несоблюдение предельного уровня дефицита бюджета. Теперь вот Мадрид получит еще один экономический удар. Иногда кажется, что ЕС сам себе роет могилу непродуманными действиями в целях мифической солидарности с Вашингтоном.

Комплекс Новодевичьего монастыря существенно обновят к 2023 году,"0 комментариев 0 поделились Фото: Fotodom.ru/DP 
Согласно распоряжению правительства РФ, размещенное на официальном интернет-портале правовой информации, комплекс работ должен быть проведен до 2022 года. В 20173–2018 годах разработают план управления объектом в соответствии с требованием Конвенции об охране всемирного культурного наследия 1972 года, этот документ планируется передать в ЮНЕСКО. Также в 20173–2019 годах должна быть разработана концепция перспективного развития ансамбля Новодевичьего монастыря. 
Как сообщает ТАСС, благоустройство территории историко-культурного ансамбля продлится до 2023 года. Объект избавят от временных хозяйственных построек, будет ликвидирована стихийная парковка туристических автобусов в пределах границ буферной зоны, при этом вблизи памятника появится служебная парковка для нужд Московской епархии Русской православной церкви. Кроме этого планируется создать экспозиционно-выставочный музейный центр, который станет структурным подразделением Государственного исторического музея. 
Напомним, Реставрация Новодевичьего монастыря началась в 2012 году, из-за подготовки проектной документации, в активную фазу она вступила в 2014 году. В марте 2016 года заместитель министра культуры РФ Николай Малаков сообщал ТАСС, что реставрация должна завершиться в 2019 году. Общий объем финансирования, по его словам, составляет 5,2 миллиардов рублей, из них на тот момент уже было освоено 1,5 миллиарда. 
Новодевичий монастырь был основан великим князем Василием III в 1524 году. Он входит в список Всемирного наследия ЮНЕСКО. В 2010 году передан Русской православной церкви и в настоящее время находится в совместном ведении с Государственным историческим музеем. 
В марте 2016 года вице-глава Министерства культуры и еще несколько человек были задержаны по подозрению в хищении не менее 60 миллионов рублей, выделенных на реставрацию объектов культурного наследия. 
По данным следствия, в 2012 году замминистра культуры РФ Григорий Пирумов создал преступную группу, участники которой заключали госконтракты с недостоверной информацией и завышенной стоимостью услуг на выполнение реставрационных работ с целью хищения денежных средств. 
В деле пока фигурируют четыре эпизода: хищение средств, выделенных на выполнение реставрационных работ ансамбля Новодевичьего монастыря, Драмтеатра в Пскове, Иоанно-Предтеченского монастыря и музея Космонавтики в Калуге. По словам одного из адвокатов, сумма ущерба составляет более 100 млн рублей. 
Кроме того, как сообщала Pravda. Ru, ранее ФСБ возбудила уголовное дело в отношении некоторых руководящих работников министерства культуры РФ и ряда предпринимателей, подозреваемых в хищении государственных денежных средств, выделенных на проведение реставрационных работ на объектах культурного наследия. 
В рамках дела были заключены под стражу замминистра культуры Григорий Пирумов, глава ФГУП ""Центр реставрации"" Олег Иванов, директор департамента управления имуществом и инвестиционной политики министерства культуры Борис Мазо, глава компании ""БалтСтрой"" Дмитрий Сергеев, управляющий ""БалтСтроя"" Александр Коченов, предприниматель Никита Колесников, глава ФГКУ ""Дирекция по строительству, реконструкции и реставрации"" Борис Цагараев и руководитель проекта ООО ""Стройкомплект"" и АО ""БалтСтрой"" Владимир Сванбек.

Зачем украинскому олигарху российское гражданство?,"0 комментариев 2 поделились Фото: Fotodom.ru/Коммерсантъ 
Напомним, Эдуард Шифрин является одним из соучредителей холдинга Midland Group, которая ведет проекты в области металлургии, недвижимости и сельского хозяйства. На территории РФ компания владеет различной недвижимостью. По оценкам финансовых аналитиков, состояние Шифрина составляет более 1 млрд долларов. 
Прокомментировать ситуацию Pravda.Ru попросила руководителя Института политических исследований при Депортаменте стран СНГ Алексея Бычкова. 
— Почему богатые люди с Украины уезжают не на Запад, а в Россию? 
— Прежде всего, это связано с тем, что в 2014 году произошла ""революция недвижимости"", как об этом говорят на Украине, прежде всего имея в виду передел сфер влияния олигархов. Кто-то в этом переделе получил преимущество, например, Порошенко, Коломойский получили там новые предприятия и новые финансовые механизмы. А кто-то, наоборот, потерял, например, Ахметов. 
В основном убытки понесли представители, скажем так, донецкой и восточной группы, тот же Шифрин из Днепропетровска. Сейчас, естественно, эти люди имеют серьезное влияние — финансовое и политическое — на Украине, и у них по-прежнему до сих пор сохраняются определенные политические силы, финансовые механизмы воздействия. 
Поэтому я считаю, что Москва принимает правильное решение. С одной стороны, она объединяет людей, скажем так, положительно относящихся к России. Здесь безусловно важно отметить, что у Шифрина большое количества бизнесов находится в России, много недвижимости, которая находится на территории России. Естественно, этим людям более выгодно взаимодействие с Россией. 
Когда произошел Майдан, Украина раскололось на две части не только с точки зрения языкового отношения, культурного отношения, типа ""русский мир"" и ""украинские националисты"". Раскол прошел и с точки зрения крупных финансовых магнатов, в частности, олигархов. И этот раскол в перспективе приведет к тому, что Украина прекратит существовать как государство. 
На сегодняшний день происходит гражданская война (по другому ее не назовешь), и это последствия того, что одни люди, скажем так, пытались отодвинуть других влиятельных людей на Украине и заполучить бразды правления и финансовые механизмы. А из-за этого, естественно, страдают простые люди. Есть такая украинская поговорка, паны скубятся, а у холопов чубы летят. 
— Не вызовет ли эта история недовольство, учитывая, что, скажем, украинскому шахтеру, наверное, не так просто получить российское гражданство. Сколько у нас украинцев, и нормально ли у них миграционные вопросы решаются? 
— Это политическая история. Она никак не связана с миграционными потоками. Это сугубо связано с тем, что влиятельных людей, которые критически относятся в нынешнее время к правительству в Киеве, Владимир Владимирович Путин объединяет вокруг себя. 
С одной стороны, это положительно с точки зрения позиции ""враг моего врага — мой друг"". С другой стороны, у нас у самих огромное количество олигархов, чье состояние хранится в лондонских, кипрских и других банках за пределами Российской Федерации. И естественно, новые олигархи, у которых состояние исчисляется в фунтах, тот же Шифрин, который уже на протяжении долго периода времени проживал не на территории Украины, а в Англии, сложно сказать, какое влияние будут оказывать. Ведь Англия сейчас является главным геополитическим врагом России. Насколько это правильное, взвешенное с точки зрения далеко идущих планов решение — это уже сложно оценить. Но это политическое решение, принятое в верхах, где, наверное, немного больше видят, чем мы.

"Путин: ""Российская угроза"" - глупость и вымысел","0 комментариев 10 поделились 
По словам президента, постоянно штампуются мифы о ""пресловутой российской военной угрозе"". 
""Действительно, это прибыльное занятие, можно новые военные бюджеты выбивать в своих собственных странах, нагибать союзников под интересы одной сверхдержавы, расширить НАТО, приблизить инфраструктуру альянса, боевые подразделения, технику к нашим границам"", — отметил российский лидер. 
Президент России назвал НАТО пережившей свой век структурой, созданной во времена холодной войны. Никакой адаптации альянса к новым условиям не происходит, несмотря на постоянные разговоры об этом, подчеркнул Путин. 
Он также отметил, что ОБСЕ постоянно пытаются превратить в инструмент обслуживания чьих-то внешнеполитических интересов, несмотря на то, что это важный механизм обеспечения европейской и трансатлантической безопасности. И в результате этот механизм работает ""вхолостую"", считает президент России. 
Путин подчеркнул, что Россия не стремиться к глобальному доминированию и экспансии. 
""Стран, которые как Россия могут опереться на тысячелетнюю историю, в мире немало, и мы научились ценить свою идентичность, свободу, независимость. При этом мы не стремимся ни к глобальному доминированию, ни к экспансии, ни к конфронтации с кем бы то ни было"", — сказал глава государства.

"Путин: Не думаю, что агрессивность - мой стиль","0 комментариев 18 поделились 
""Уважаемый модератор (сессии) пожелал мне благополучно выйти на пенсию, я тоже себе этого желаю. Когда время придет, это (будет) очень правильно, нужно сделать. Пока я еще не на пенсии, действующий руководитель большой державы, я должен быть сдержанным, не проявлять в своих выражениях излишнюю агрессивность. Я, собственно говоря, и не думаю, что это мой стиль"", — сказал Путин на итоговой пленарной сессии ежегодного заседания Международного дискуссионного клуба ""Валдай"". 
Президент также отметил, что хотя все атрибуты демократии в современных ведущих государствах налицо, реально у большинства граждан нет влияния на власть. 
""Выборы перестают быть инструментом перемен, а сводятся к скандалам, к обсуждению компроматов, простите меня, к обсуждению того, кто кого за что ущипнул, кто с кем спит. Но это просто переходит всякие границы. Да и, честно говоря, если посмотреть на программы кандидатов, то такое впечатление, что они скроены по одним и тем же лекалам"", — отметил российский лидер. 
""Граждане чувствуют, что их интересы и представление элит о единственно правильном курсе, который эти элиты выбирают, все чаще и больше расходятся между собой. Как следствие, референдумы, выборы, все чаще и больше преподносят сюрпризы для власти. Люди голосуют совсем не так, как им советовали официальные респектабельные СМИ, не так это рекомендуют так называемые ""системные партии"". А общественные движения, которые еще совсем недавно считались слишком левыми или слишком правыми, выходят на авансцену, оттесняя политических тяжеловесов"", — цитирую Владимира Путина РИА Новости. 
Он отметил, что сперва такие неудобные результаты пытались объявить некой аномалией. А когда они стали повторяться, ""заговорили о том, что общество не понимает тех, кто находится на Олимпе власти, не доросло до того, чтобы оценить устремления властных структур, заботу о народном благе, а то и вовсе доходит до истерики, мол, это следствие зарубежной, как правило, российской пропаганды"". 
Говоря об актуальных проблемах современности, глава государства отметил, что правила в мировой политике и экономике постоянно меняются. 
""Противоречия, связанные с перераспределением экономической мощи и политического влияния, только нарастают. Груз взаимного недоверия сужает наши возможности эффективно отвечать на стоящие перед мировым сообществом реальные вызовы и реальные угрозы. По сути, в кризисе оказался сам проект глобализации, а в Европе говорят уже, мы это хорошо знаем и слышим, о несостоятельности мультикультурализма"", — отметил Владимир Путин. 
""Считаю, что такая ситуация — во многом следствие ошибочного, поспешного, а в чем-то и самоуверенного выбора, сделанного элитами некоторых государств четверть века назад. Тогда… был шанс не просто ускорить процессы глобализации, а принять при этом качественно иной, гармоничный, устойчивый характер"", — подчеркнул президент. 
Владимир Путин также отметил, что санкции используются сейчас для политического давления, при этом создаются закрытые торговые альянсы в обход ВТО. Поделиться:",1
В машине предполагаемых убийц Немцова обнаружены биоматериалы,"0 комментариев 4 поделились Фото: Fotodom.ru/Коммерсантъ 
""Экспертиза биологических материалов с подголовника, изъятого из указанного автомобиля была проведена экспертами ФСБ. Согласно результатам экспертизы, они принадлежат Шадиду Губашеву"", — цитирует прокурора Марию Семененко ТАСС. 
Она также добавила, что в автомобиле были найдены осколки компакт-диска, на которых обнаружили биоматериалы еще одного обвиняемого — Анзора Губашева. 
Однако Шадид Губашев данную информацию отрицает, заявляя, что "" никогда не находился в этой машине"". 
Ранее Pravda. Ru писала, что все фигуранты дела об убийстве политика Бориса Немцова отрицают свою причастность к преступлению . 3 октября на открывшемся в Москве процессе после оглашения обвинительного заключения все подсудимые заявили, что они невиновны. 
Отметим, ранее ТАСС писало, что оружие убийства политика, найти так и не удалось. ""Оружие, из которого был застрелен Немцов, найдено не было"", — сказала прокурор Мария Семененко. 
Из обвинительного заключения следует, что приобрел оружие предполагаемый организатор убийства Руслан Мухудинов, который далее передал пистолет Зауру Дадаеву и Анзору Губашеву. Мария Семененко также отметила, что обвиняемые получили за убийство политика не менее 15 миллионов рублей. 
По данным прокурора, Немцов был убит четырьмя выстрелами. ""Дадаев произвел три выстрела, увидел, что тот (Немцов) начал подниматься, и произвел еще три выстрела. От четырех ранений Немцов скончался. Было три сквозных и два слепых ранения"", — сообщила Семененко. 
В то же время представители семьи Бориса Немцова считают дело о его убийстве нераскрытым, так как расследование проведено неэффективно. ""Необходимо установить заказчиков. Расследование не является эффективным и всесторонним. Не установлен мотив преступления"", — заявила адвокат Ольга Михайлова. 
По ее словам, организатор и заказчик преступления до сих пор не задержаны. А реальный мотив и цель убийства политика не установлены. 
Напомним, Борис Немцов был убит в центре Москвы 27 февраля 2015 года. На скамье подсудимых оказались пять предполагаемых исполнителей преступления: Заур Дадаев, Анзор и Шадид Губашевы, Тамерлан Эскерханов и Хамзат Бахаев. В зависимости от роли и степени участия они обвиняются в совершении преступления. 
Предполагаемым заказчиком и организатором убийства следствие считает бывшего офицера батальона ""Север"" Руслана Мухудинова, который находится в международном розыске. Ему заочно предъявлено обвинение.

"Россия докажет в ООН, что договор по Сирии не выполняют США","0 комментариев 13 поделились Фотоархив Правды.Ру 
Об этом сегодня на брифинге в Москве заявила официальный представитель МИД РФ Мария Захарова, отметив, что постоянно звучат заявления о том, что РФ не выполняет свои обязательства в контексте мирного плана по Сирии. 
""Чтобы прекратить всяческие инсинуации на это тему Российская Федерация приняла решение распространить документ, в котором собраны и приводятся все факты по исполнению российской стороны своих обязательств и невыполнения обязательств американской стороной своих - представлены все факты и цифры"", - рассказала Захарова. 
По ее словам, этот документ будет представлен на площадке ООН не только в Нью-Йорке, но и в Женеве. 
«Приведены факты, даты, цифры. Этот объемный документ уже распространён в Женеве нашим постпредством и будет распространён сегодня российским постпредством при ООН в Нью-Йорке», - подытожила она. 
В ходе брифинга Захарова также обратила внимание на то, что Вашингтон на словах рассуждает о вариантах мирного урегулирования, но не подкрепляет это делом. 
""На деле не исключается вариант пособничества боевика, мы видели, что в 2013 году рассматривались варианты прямой агрессии, а сейчас мы видим, что реально обсуждаются варианты поставки вооружения боевикам"", - заявила официальный представитель МИД РФ. 
Вместе с тем Захарова выразила надежду, что США не станут поставлять тяжелое вооружение умеренной оппозиции в Сирии: ""Мы надеемся, что в американском руководстве разумный и трезвый расчет действительно возобладает над авантюрными подходами, которые могут привести к непредсказуемым военным и политическим последствиям. Будем продолжать следить за реальными действиями Вашингтона"". 
Чем ближе взятие Алеппо, тем яростнее будут обвинения в адрес России , считает сотрудник Центра анализа стратегий и технологий Максим Шеповаленко. Информационные вбросы, подобные истории об российском ударе по школе в провинции Идлиб , будут продолжаться до конца войны. ""Все пошло враздрай: никаких мирных переговоров, вступил в силу План Б - по вооружению боевиков. Значит, информационная война в самом разгаре"" - сказал аналитик в беседе с Pravda.Ru 
Всем очевидно, что чем ближе мы будем к взятию Алеппо, тем истеричнее и фантасмагоричнее будут все эти придумки и рассказы, уверен он.

"В МВД опровергли, что разыскивают 13-летнюю дочь Сердюкова","0 комментариев 3 поделились Фото: Fotodom.ru/Коммерсантъ 
Ранее в СМИ появилась информация о том, что в Москве без вести пропала 13-летняя дочь Анатолия Сердюкова. Якобы 26 октября Наталья сбежала из дома вместе с 16-летней подругой, и к поиску подростков подключились сотрудники ФСБ РФ. 
По данным ""МК"", школьницы запланировали побег еще несколько дней назад. 16-летняя девочка вела себя странно. По словам родных, в выходные школьница купила походную палатку. А 26 октября, придя домой из школы, надела теплые вещи, немного перекусила и убежала из дома на глазах удивленной бабушки. Позже родственники нашли записку, вложенную в планшет со словами: ""Я ушла познавать мир"". 
Родители девочки сразу позвонили в полицию. Тогда выяснилось, что школьница ушла из дома с 13-летней подружкой, дочерью от второго брака бывшего министра обороны Анатолия Сердюкова. Подростки познакомилась по интернету, а за день до побега ходили вместе в театр. 
Как сообщают СМИ, Наталья проживает в отцовской квартире на Рочдельской улице, рядом с Белым домом. Перед побегом девочка отправила маме смс-сообщение: ""Я ухожу из дома"". Телефон беглянка не отключила, поэтому аппарат успели запеленговать. 
Не так давно еще один представитель ""золотой молодежи"" попал на страницы СМИ. Сына вице-президента ""Лукойла"" Руслана Шамсуарова приговорили к 300 часам обязательных работ по делу о гонке на Gelandewagen. Как сообщает РИА Новости, такое же наказание Гагаринский суд Москвы назначил Виктору Ускову. 
Обвинения в угрозе применения насилия в отношении сотрудников ДПС с них сняты, однако, оба признаны виновными в оскорблении полицейских. Сидевший за рулем во время погони, Абдувахоб Маджидов, оправдан по всем эпизодам. Суд также постановил изъять элитный внедорожник в пользу государства. 
Напомним, в мае 2016 года на Ленинском проспекте столицы Руслан Шамсуаров с друзьями устроили гонки. Видеоролик, на котором молодые люди на Mercedes-Benz G63 AMG нарушали правила дорожного движения, а затем пытались скрыться от полиции, вызвал большой общественный резонанс. Участники гонки получили по 15 суток административного ареста. 
Позже против молодых людей были возбуждены уголовные дела по факту ""угрозы применения насилия в отношении представителя власти"" и ""оскорбление представителя власти"". Фразы, сказанные нарушителями в адрес сотрудников ДПС, ""имели негативный окрас"" и ""порочили честь и репутацию полицейских"". Лингвисты выяснили, что подсудимые пытались ""показать свое превосходство"". 
Прокуратура просила для Шамсуарова и Маджидова наказания в виде двух лет и одного месяца колонии общего режима, а для Ускова, ранее уже судимого, два года и семь месяцев.

Канада и ЕС подпишут соглашение о свободной торговле,"0 комментариев 0 поделились источник Pravda.Ru 
Как сообщается в Twitter представительства Словакии в ЕС, ""(заседание комитета постоянных представителей ЕС закончилось с положительным результатом - пакет документов по CETA одобрен и достигнута договоренность по проведению письменной процедуры принятия Европейским советом до полуночи пятницы)"". Как пишет RT, в настоящее время страна председательствует в интеграционном объединении. 
Ранее сообщалось , что власти Бельгии и представители регионов и сообществ страны достигли договорённости по соглашению о свободной торговле между ЕС и Канадой, сняв тем самым последнее препятствие для подписания документа. 
Вашингтонский Центр стратегических и международных исследований совместно с болгарским Центром исследований демократии ранее опубликовали доклад ""Кремль. Руководство: Российское влияние в Восточной и Центральной Европе"". В документе отмечается, что экономическое присутствие России в Болгарии ""граничит с захватом государства"". 
Согласно докладу, Москва использует экономические рычаги воздействия, чтобы дискредитировать либерально-демократическую модель развития Болгарии. То же самое относится и к Венгрии, Латвии, Сербии и Словакии. ""В некоторых странах российское влияние насколько всепроникающее и эндемическое, что угрожает национальной безопасности, как и западной ориентации стран и евроатлантической стабильности"", - отмечают авторы доклада. 
Названы четыре болгарские партии, которые, так или иначе, являются ""проводниками российского империализма"". Особое внимание уделено партии""Атака"". ""Российское влияние привело к созданию странной политической коалиции между партиями БСП, ДПС и АБВ, которые работают над созданием пророссийской коалиции, пытаясь свергнуть сегодняшнее правительство"", - подчеркивают авторы доклада. 
""Для поддержки российского экономического господства и во избежание подробных проверок бизнеса, Кремль использует сложные и теневые сети, охватывающие государственных служащих и бизнес общность. Требования о непрозрачности сделок создало порочный круг увеличения российского экономического влияния и ухудшения болгарских стандартов управления. Подобная практика применяется в управлении госкомпаниями, крупными энергетическими проектами, при заключении договоров по итогам тендеров, одобрении слияния и приобретения и использования ""лазеек"" в корпоративном управлении для блокировки политических инициатив, противоречащих российским бизнес и стратегическим интересам"", - говорится в докладе. 
""Приобретая значительное влияние над болгарской экономикой, Россия использует свою доминирующую позицию в стратегических секторах для усиления существующих связей и создания новых коррумпированных бизнесменов и местных олигархов. Со своей стороны эти бизнесмены связаны с известными политиками, на которых имеют значительное влияние. Политики заключают сделки в пользу этих бизнесменов и усиливают их власть в коррупционных сетях страны и в государственных учреждениях"", - в таком духе выдержан доклад. 
В этом свете особо уместно порекомендовать следующую статью: ""НАТО уничтожает армию Болгарии"". Однако чрезмерное влияние НАТО и Брюсселя на Болгарию никак не отражено в докладе.

Лидер иракских курдов рассказал о сроках операции в Мосуле,"0 комментариев 0 поделились 
""Мы смогли быстро отвоевать приступы к городу, неизвестно, насколько сильно ИГ будет обороняться в самом городе. Но мы видим, что у них есть сотни смертников, должно быть, там целые фабрики по производству взрывчатки. При штурме это создаст большую опасность. Если все и дальше пойдет хорошо, я рассчитываю, что город удастся освободить самое позднее через три месяца"", - сказал Барзани в интервью таблоиду Bild . 
По его слвоам, отряды курдских сил самообороны ""пешмерга"" не участвуют в штурме самого города, так как связаны соглашением с Багдадом и международной коалицией. ""Будет лучше, если в город войдет иракская армия, чтобы избежать конфликта среди населения между арабами и курдами. Но если нас попросят, и будет новое соглашение, мы, конечно, поможем, мы к этому готовы"", - добавил президент. 
Как пишет РИА Новости, на территории Иракского Курдистана находится 1,8 миллиона беженцев, в дополнение к этому еще до миллиона человек могут прийти из Мосула. 
Напомним, 17 октября премьер-министр Ирака Хайдер аль-Абади заявил о начале военной операции по освобождению Мосула от боевиков ИГ. США и их союзники с 2014 года проводят в Ираке и Сирии операцию против ИГ. Иракские военные и силы полиции, а также курдские формирования при поддержке авиации коалиции во главе с США начали массированное наступление на город. 
Однако это наступление может обернуться катастрофой на Ближнем Востоке. Об этом заявил, к примеру, кандидат в президенты США Дональд Трамп. Или вот мнение отставного полковника США Дэниэла Дэвиса, которое он изложил в статье, опубликованной в The National Interest : Америке и силам коалиции стоит поторопиться с проведением операции в Мосуле, в противном случае террористы могут разорвать этот альянс Чем дольше продержится ИГ и чем больший урон нанесет коалиции, тем более вероятно, что религиозные и политические различия между освободительными силами будут проявляться все сильнее"", - пишет Дэвис. 
Прокомментировать ситуацию Pravda.Ru попросила военного эксперта Бориса Подопригору. 
В последние несколько месяцев официального пребывания американского президента в Белом доме, им захотелось организовать такой политический спектакль на тему американской приверженности в борьбе с терроризмом. Я так это вижу. 
Что из этого получится, мне сказать сложно. Самое плохое, что я ожидаю, это новое столкновение по линии сунниты-шииты. Вот в чем самая большая проблема. 
Если начнется резня, а такое исключать нельзя, то мало никому не покажется, хотя бы потому, что и Иран, и Саудовская Аравия в стороне от этого конфликта не будут. Можно лишь пожалеть, что в американском практическом востоковедении немного людей, которые задумываются о последствиях межрелигиозного столкновения.

"Apple выпустит три стеклянных ""айфона""","0 комментариев 0 поделились 
Как пишет Nikkei Asian Review со ссылкой на осведомленный источник, кроме стандартных 4,7 и 5,5-дюймовых версий, в линейке может появиться смартфон с диагональю пять дюймов. Также источник рассказал, что старшая версия смартфона получит изогнутый OLED-дисплей, когда как остальные модели оснастят LCD-экраном. 
Напомним, производителями фронтальных панелей стали компании Biel Crystal Manufactory и Lens Technology. Они же выпускают и задние крышки для смартфонов, которые также будут выполнены из стекла. 
По данным СМИ, в 2017 году Apple будет праздновать 10-летний юбилей с выхода первого iPhone. Опираясь на это, многие аналитики предрекают полный редизайн смартфона и добавление множества новых функций. Так, в сентябре источники рассказал, что компания минует промежуточную модель 7s и выпустит iPhone 8. 
26 октября, компания впервые за 15 лет отчиталась о снижении годовой выручки. Около 63 процентов выручки обеспечили продажи iPhone, которых в четвертом квартале было реализовано 45,5 миллиона штук. 
Федеральная антимонопольная служба РФ начала проверку цен на iPhone 7, после которой ведомство может возбудить новое дело против Apple. 
Как сообщает ТАСС, ссылаясь на представителя антимонопольной службы, анализ будет проводится в течение месяца или чуть-чуть побольше, по его итогам будет принято решение. Вместо возбуждения нового дела ФАС может расширить уже возбужденное против Apple после проверки цен на iPhone 6. 
Информацию у американской корпорации по ценообразованию на новые смартфоны в РФ пока ещё не запрашивали. 
Напомним, в начале августа 2016 года ФАС возбудила дело в отношении группы лиц в составе Apple Inc., а также ООО ""Эппл Рус"", Apple Holding B. V., Apple Sales Ireland, Apple Operations International. Поводом стали результаты проведенной ведомством проверки, показавшей, что с начала официальных продаж iPhone 6s и iPhone 6s Plus в России большинство реселлеров установили на эти смартфоны одинаковые цены и удерживали их. 16 крупнейших торговых сетей России установили одинаковую цену на смартфоны Apple. Позже стало известно, что корпорация может заплатить штраф в размере до 5 миллионов рублей. 
Ведомство заявило, что такие совпадения могут являться результатом координации ценообразования российских реселлеров группой компаний Apple, которая привела к установлению цен на российском рынке и принятию рекомендованных цен в качестве обязательных. 
Apple в ответ заявила, что реселлеры самостоятельно устанавливают цены на продаваемую у них продукцию Apple. Напомним, в конце сентября начали продажи Apple iPhone 7 и iPhone 7 Plus. Число предзаказов на новинки от Apple, по данным Hi-Tech Mail. Ru, совокупно по всем ритейлерам достигло 20 тысяч. Новинки доступны в пяти цветах - золотом, серебристом, ""розовом золоте"", черном и ""черном ониксе"". Стоимость iPhone 7 начинается от 56,99 тысячи рублей, iPhone 7 Plus - от 67,99 тысячи рублей. 
У нового телефона остался 3,5-мм разъем, а также два слота для SIM-карт. Согласно, iPhone 7 вышел в трех модификациях. Две младших модели получат 4,7-дюймовый экран, а у старшей он будет крупнее, 5,5-дюймов. 
Ранее ходили слухи, что Apple выпустит 4,7-дюймовый iPhone 7 и два 5,5-дюймовых смартфона - iPhone 7 Plus и iPhone 7 Pro. Помимо этого, iPhone 7 сохранит 3,5-мм разъем, это подтвердили в компании.

США обвинили Китай в краже военных секретов,"0 комментариев 0 поделились источник Pravda.Ru 
Как сообщает freebeacon.com, ссылаясь на доклад, ""Соединенные Штаты в последнее время сталкиваются с большой и растущей угрозой своей национальной безопасности со стороны китайских спецслужб по сбору разведывательной информации"". 
Эксперты выделяют как наиболее серьезную угрозу усилия Китая по проникновению в закрытое киберпространство и американские национальные структуры безопасности. 
Прогнозируется, что китайские спецслужбы могли получить доступ к 5,6 миллионам отпечатков, некоторые из которых ""могут быть использованы для идентификации правительственных агентов США, работающих под прикрытием, или для копирования биоматериала для доступа к секретной информации"". 
По оценке авторов доклада, деятельность китайской разведки ""значительно усилилась"" за последние 15 лет и реализуется через различные структуры, в том числе министерство государственной безопасности, Народно-освободительную армию Китая и другие военные организации. 
Копия проекта годового отчета за 2016 год была получена Washington Free Beacon. Окончательный отчет будет обнародован 16 ноября. 
Система европейской ПРО представляет угрозу безопасности России, заявил ранее заместитель начальника оперативного управления Объединенного штаба Центрального военного совета КНР генерал-майор Цай Цзюнь 
Такое заявление китайский генерал сделал во время совместной с минобороны России пресс-конференции, посвященной вопросам противоракетной обороны. 
""США, реализуя план поэтапного развития системы европейской ПРО, не предоставили юридические гарантии ненаправленности ее против Российской Федерации. При этом в действительности она представляет прямую угрозу безопасности России"", - заявил Цай Цзюнь. 
Кроме того, он добавил, что Россия и Китай в 2017 году проведут второе учение по ПРО. 
Напомним, как сообщала Правда.Ру, о том, что свободному использованию космического пространства может помешать система противоракетной обороны (ПРО) США, заявил сегодня в ходе брифинга ""Глобальная эшелонированная система ПРО США как угроза военной безопасности России и Китая и стратегической стабильности в мире"" представитель главного оперативного управления Генштаба ВС РФ генерал-лейтенант Виктор Познихир.

Компания Alibaba открыла вакансию кота,"0 комментариев 0 поделились источник Pravda.Ru 
Как сообщает Crienglish.com, кота компания рассчитывает найти до 10 ноября. В этот день в преддверии крупнейшего в КНР торгового фестиваля состоится гала-вечер интернет-магазина Tmall (его символом является черный кот). В Alibaba рассчитывают, что животное станет объектом для новых мемов и вирусных видео, а также увеличит продажи. 
Ранее Alibaba ранее уже удалось привлечь ставших популярными в сети котов, к примеру, сердитого котика из США (Grumpy Cat), кота по кличке Анри из Франции, Мару из Японии. В должности заинтересованы Милк и Орео из Великобритании, а также китайские коты, сообщает портал. 
Напомним, компания Alibaba основана в 1999 году. В ее структуру входит десяток интернет-площадок, в том числе AliExpress, Taobao и китайское подразделение Yahoo!. 
Американские ученые пришли к выводу, что гладить кошек - опасно для здоровья. 
В ходе исследований ученые выяснили, что близкое общение с кошками опасно для человеческой жизни, сообщает РИА VladNews со ссылкой на Информинг. 
Согласно исследованиям, домашние любимцы передают своим хозяевам инфекции чаще, чем считалось ранее. Результат исследования показал, что кошачьи царапины, которые появляются в ходе общения между кошками и их хозяевами, могут привести к серьезному заболеванию - «кошачьей лихорадке». 
Ранки от кошачьих ногтей могут спровоцировать высокую температуру и даже могут стать причиной летального исхода. 
По словам специалистов, не следует заводить кошек, когда в доме есть маленькие дети, а также после общения с животными следует тщательно мыть руки. 
Специалисты-фелинологи уже полгода ведут наблюдение за хвостатыми подопытными и к 2021 году обещают объяснить, что означает вся гамма издаваемых нашими любимцами звуков. 
Исследователи в процессе опыта записывают все звуки, которые выдают 50 подопытных котов, когда они голодны, испуганы, ищут ласки или просто довольны. 
Полученные результаты анализируют и классифицируют. Уже установлено, что кошки способны изменять интонацию или мелодику осознанно, желая донести до хозяина определенную информацию, делится наблюдениями специалист в области фонетики Сусанна Шетц . Например, когда кошка просит еду, она мяукает тоньше. 
По мнению фелинологов, вербальное общение - не главное средство связи этих животных с человеком: диалог в основном идет на языке тела и запахов. Некоторые проблемы во взаимопонимании возникают еще и потому, что по сравнению с собаками, и уж тем более людьми, мурки имеют очень мало лицевых мышц. Впрочем, научившись шифровать эмоции, сами они легко считывают информацию с лиц хозяев.

Приморские ТОР могут получить 260 млрд руб. инвестиций,"0 комментариев 0 поделились 
""На сегодняшний день потенциальные инвесторы подали 56 заявок на получение статуса резидентов территорий опережающего развития в Приморье. Сумма заявленных инвестиций - более 260 млрд рублей. Очень важно, что налажена работа с инвесторами, и эти заявки переходят в реализуемые инвестиционные проекты"", приводит ТАСС слова Галушки. 
По его словам, к настоящему времени ""от общего объема заявленных инвестиций более 75%, более 202 млрд рублей, - это уже подписанные с инвесторами соглашения по реализации проектов в Приморье"". 
Как отметил Галушка, на совещании было заявлено еще о семи новых потенциальных резидентах с инвестициями на общую сумму 64 млрд рублей. 
По каждой территории опережающего развития Приморского края будет сформирована своя проектная команда. В нее войдут представители Минвостокразвития, Корпорации развития Дальнего Востока, администрации региона, инфраструктурных компаний и других заинтересованных организаций и ведомств, сообщил Галушка. 
Напомним, в настоящее время в Приморье работают три ТОР: ""Надеждинская"" со специализаций на логистике, агротерритория ""Михайловский"" и ""Большой Камень"", где строится крупнейшая в мире судоверфь. 
Правда.ру писала, что власти Приморья выдали 53 ""дальневосточных гектара"" новым владельцам. 
Как пишет Российская газета, документы еще по 88 участкам находятся на подписи у граждан, а более полутора тысяч заявок находятся на рассмотрении у муниципальных властей. 
Отметим, что гектары в Приморье находятся на втором месте по популярности у дальневосточников. На первом месте - Якутия, на втором - Сахалин. 
Ежедневно более 500 жителей ДФО подают заявки на ""гектар"". Чаще всего землю жители Дальнего Востока берут под жилищное строительство, сельское хозяйство, пасеки, складское хозяйство и производство. 
Любой россиянин сможет получить по ""дальневосточному гектару"" в 2017 году, а с октября этого года землю будут предоставлять по всей территории региона, заявил министр РФ по развитию Дальнего Востока Александр Галушка. 
Галушка в интервью газете ""Известия"" пояснил, что ""с 1 октября 2016 года участки будут предоставляться уже на всей территории Дальнего Востока. А с 2017 года ""дальневосточным гектаром"" смогут обзавестись не только жители ДФО, а любой россиянин. При этом государство предъявляет одно требование - земля должна быть освоена по истечении пяти лет, иначе она будет возвращена государству. Тем же, кто освоил, ее бесплатно передадут в собственность"".

"СМИ Сербии приписали россиянам ""подготовку терактов"" в Черногории","0 комментариев 0 поделились Фото: AP 
Однако глава правительства Сербии Александр Вучич отказался комментировать сообщения о высланных россиянах. ""Не все в вашем вопросе неверно, одна часть не точна. Я не хотел вам отвечать не только по той причине, которую уже назвал, но и еще из-за одной вещи — потому, что об этих делах я говорить не имею права по закону"", — сказал Вучич белградскому телеканалу N1. 
Новость о депортации российских граждан совпала с неожиданным приездом в Белград секретаря Совбеза РФ Николая Патрушева. Сербские эксперты убеждены, что главная цель визита — обсуждение ситуации в Черногории. Как сообщает ""Коммерсантъ"", ссылаясь на близких к правительству Сербии источников, Белград не заинтересован в таком скандале, но и не хочет быть заподозренным в причастности к неким ""террористическим акциям"". 
Во время своего визита Николай Патрушев встретился со всем руководством республики: 26 октября — с президентом Томиславом Николичем и главой МИДа Ивицей Дачичем, а 27 октября — с премьером Александром Вучичем. Все переговоры прошли в строго закрытом режиме. В самом начале визита было официально объявлено, что Патрушев предложил сербским властям подписать меморандум о взаимопонимании в области безопасности, который создал бы постоянный канал связи между Москвой и Белградом в этой сфере. 
Однако профессор факультета безопасности Белградского университета Зоран Драгишич уверен, что визит связан с тем, что произошло в соседней Черногории, где власти объявили о предотвращении террористических акций в день выборов. Этой же точки зрения придерживается сербский военный эксперт Александр Радич. Источник ""Ъ"" близкий к правительству Сербии считает, что ""российский гость наверняка хотел бы прояснить наши шаги по сотрудничеству с Черногорией в расследовании активности групп, готовивших беспорядки в Подгорице 16 октября"". 
Напомним, 16 октября в Черногории состоялись парламентские выборы . В день голосования Власти страны объявили о задержании 20 граждан Сербии по подозрению в подготовке теракта и путча. По предварительным данным, группа планировала напасть на собравшихся перед зданием парламента граждан и полицейских, занять помещения скупщины с целью провозгласить победу одной из политических партий, лишить свободы премьер-министра Черногории. Утверждается, что лидером организации был экс-начальник жандармерии Сербии Братислав ""Бато"" Дикич. 
Спустя несколько дней сербский премьер Вучич сообщил, что службы безопасности страны задержали ряд лиц, организовавших слежку за премьером Черногории. 
Напомним, на парламентских выборах в Черногории победила прозападная Демократическая партия социалистов (ДПС) премьер-министра Мило Джукановича. 
Как рассказал ранее Pravda.Ru специалист Института европейских исследований Стеван Гайич, ""даже если бы оппозиция признала выборы, разница между оппозицией и пронатовской партией Джукановича — только в одном или двух депутатах. Так что Джуканович далеко не победил. Джуканович провел эти выборы в атмосфере государственного переворота, во время выборов были выключены Viber и WhatsApp. Оппозиция впервые за 27 лет сказала: хватит, не будем больше признавать нелегитимные выборы, потому что одним и тем же образом Джуканович приобретает власть из года в год и уже 27 лет он находится практически в режиме абсолютного диктатора страны"". 
Можно предполагать, что и сообщения о подготовке ""террористических актов"" могут быть частью политической борьбы в Черногории - с учетом того, что от власти Мило Джуканович отказываться явно не собирается.

"Чуркин: США не взаимодействуют с Россией в борьбе с ""Джебхат ан-Нусрой""","0 комментариев 0 поделились источник Pravda.Ru 
По его словам, которые приводит ТАСС, ""если у нас будет эта объективная картина, то, я думаю, будет проще попытаться найти путь вперед"". Как добавили в МИД РФ, в отчете ""наглядно демонстрируются результаты проведенной Россией работы, направленной на мирное урегулирование в САР и борьбу с международным терроризмом"". 
Как пишет Российская газета, документ выполнен в виде таблицы, разделенной на разделы ""Совместное заявление России и США о прекращении боевых действий в Сирии от 22 февраля 2016 г."" и ""Договоренности России и США от 9 сентября 2016 года"". 
В документе зафиксированы конкретные пункты соглашений и их применение на практике. Согласно документа, ""взаимодействие между РФ и США в борьбе с ""Джебхат ан-Нусрой"" и ИГИЛ (запрещены в России) не началось, что способствует удержанию террористами значительных территорий, а также введению наступательных действий против правительственных войск"". 
Также в документе речь идет приостановки создания Совместного исполнительного центра России и США (СИЦ). Как отмечается в отчете, ""российские специалисты прибыли для работы в СИЦ, но к работе не приступили в связи с отказом представителей США"". 
Подготовленный документ позволяет понять, ""кто есть кто"" в решении сирийской проблемы, уверен Виталий Чуркин. 
Фактически, из-за вполне определенных указаний из Вашингтона американские специалисты, прибывшие в Сирию для создания совместного исполнительного центра (СИЦ) России и США, целью которого является планирование совместных ударов по объектам «Джабхат ан-Нусры» и ИГИЛ, так и не приступили к работе. 
Согласно документа, также Вашингтон предоставил список из 138 умеренных оппозиционных групп, при этом две из них оказались принадлежащими к террористической группировке ИГ*, а 8 - к ""Джебхат ан-Нусре""*. 
28 июля 2016 года односторонним решением США прервали контакты по горячей линии между авиабазой Хмеймим группой своих политический и военных экспертов в Аммане (Иордания). 
Напомним, Правда.Ру ранее писала о том, что российская сторона подготовила документ с фактами, подтверждающими выполнение Москвой взятых на себя обязательств по договоренностям в контексте мирного урегулирования в Сирии и невыполнение этих обязательств Вашингтоном, который Россия намерена распространить в СБ ООН, сегодня в ходе брифинга сообщила официальный представитель МИД России Мария Захарова. 
Сделано это будет для того, чтобы прекратить постоянные инсинуации на на тему о том, что РФ не выполняет свои обязательства в контексте мирного плана по Сирии. 
*""Джебхат ан-Нусра"" и ""Исламское государство"" - террористические организации, запрещенные в ряде стран мира, в том числе, и в России.

Сербская газета высмеяла украинского посла-графомана,"0 комментариев 0 поделились Фото: АР 
Как пишет журналист Боян Билбияпетак, читатели сотни раз высмеивали аргументы дипломата о ""Крыме и исторической правде"". Но Александрович готов ввести санкции. Против кого? Против всех, кто осмелился посетить ""украинский Крым"" или, не дай бог, самопровозглашенный Донбасс и не спросил у посла разрешения? 
Под удар Украины итак попали шестеро граждан Сербии , включая народных депутатов, против которых будут введены экономические санкции. Как пишет обозреватель, но и это ""Александровичу стало мало, он желает стать инквизитором, на костре которого будут гореть и сербские журналисты"". 
Так в редакцию газеты поступило сообщение Александровича, в котором он желает, чтобы ""правительство Украины открыло уголовное дело против журналиста Бояна Билбия, который побывал в Крыму в обход законов Украины"". 
Журналист издания пишет, что не понимает, чем он ""нарушил законы державы, которая годами не контролирует огромную часть своей территорию"". Однако ему совершенно ясно другое. ""Киев, через своего посла, хочет запугиваниями повлиять на свободу информации, слова и передвижения. Украинское правительство и его посол прикрываются ""европейскими ценностями"", но они должны знать, что подавление свободы СМИ и угрозы журналистам отдаляют их от стандартов европейской цивилизации"". 
Боян Билбияпетак пишет, что в демократических странах журналисты имеют право передвигаться свободно, путешествовать по миру и делать репортажи и интервью со всеми, даже если речь идет о приверженцах противоборствующих сторон, диктаторах или других темах интересных общественности. И Крым, который ""европейский Киев"" два года назад отрезал от электроэнергии и воды, является чрезвычайно интересной темой для сербской публики. 
Журналист напоминает, что читатели ""Политики"" ясно дали понять послу Украины, что они думают о его санкциях и угрозах. Билбияпетак не удивился бы, если украинское посольство задумает наказать даже правительство Сербии за то, что оно не приводит на допросы граждан, желающих посетить Крым. 
Автор считает, что посол Украины просто пускает пыль в глаза. Билбияпетак задается вопросом, почему Александрович говорит ""Косово — это Сербия, Крым — это Украина"", а Украина, в отличие от России и многих других друзей Сербии, не голосовала против принятия Косово в ЮНЕСКО? 
""Да, я, может, сам добровольно предстал бы перед судом в Киеве. Но, господин Алексанрович, вы должны лично за мной прийти"", — подытоживает Боян Билбияпетак. 
Напомним, ранее президент Сербии Томислав Николич заявил, что страна не введет санкции по отношению к России , даже если этого требует общая внешняя политика ЕС. Об этом президент республики сообщил на встрече с вице-президентом США Джозефом Байденом. 
""Мы не можем ввести санкции России, если это подразумевает приведение в согласие (сербской — ред.) внешней политики с ЕС. Мы связаны с Россией и связаны с США, в которых живет многочисленная сербская община"", — цитирует пресс-служба главу государства. 
Николич также отметил, что несмотря на то, что ""нет лучшей опции для граждан Сербии, чем путь в Евросоюз"", он не готов подписать с самопровозглашенной республикой Косово документ, который имел бы межгосударственный характер. В свою очередь, по данным пресс-службы, Байден подчеркнул, что ""США не ожидают, что Сербия сделает выбор между ними и Россией"" и поддерживают ее на пути евроинтеграции.

В духе времени: Китай обзавелся вторым авианосцем,"0 комментариев 0 поделились источник Pravda.Ru 
Новый авианосец станет вторым в составе ВМС КНР после «Ляонина». Как передает RT со ссылкой на South China Morning Post, новый авианосец построен по аналогичному принципу. 
Этот авианосец является ""частью планов Пекина по расширению возможностей своего флота на фоне растущих вызовов в спорных водах Восточно-Китайского и Южно-Китайского морей, а также для защиты национальных интересов за пределами собственных границ"". 
Напомним, в июле журнал Jane's Defence Weekly опубликовал спутниковый снимок первого китайского авианосца национальной постройки, строящегося на китайском судостроительном предприятии Dalian Shipbuilding Industry Company (Group) в Даляне. 
Сообщается, что первый китайский авианосец национальной постройки практически полностью повторяет приобретенный и достроенный Китаем бывший советский тяжелый авианесущий крейсер «Варяг» советского проекта 11436, который теперь называется «Ляонин». 
Судя по снимку, первый китайский авианосец национальной постройки практически полностью повторяет приобретенный и достроенный Китаем бывший советский тяжелый авианесущий крейсер «Варяг» советского проекта 11436, который теперь называется «Ляонин». 
Правда.ру ранее писала, что военные Китая заявили, что КНР не будет оставаться в стороне, когда некоторые страны пытаются создать хаос в регионе Южно-Китайского моря. 
Заместитель главы генштаба народно-освободительной армии КНР Сунь Цзяньго в ответ на призыв США отказаться от провокаций в Южно-Китайском море заявил, что ""мы не создаем проблем, но мы и не боимся их"". 
Как пишет ИА Интерфакс, Сунь Цзяньго в ходе выступления на конференции по безопасности Азии в Сингапуре подчеркнул, что ""другие страны должны играть конструктивную роль в этом отношении, а не наоборот"". 
По его словам, вопрос о Южно-Китайском море приобрел остроту из-за провокаций со стороны некоторых стран, ""преследующих собственные интересы"". 
В Пекине отметили, что ряд стран региона намеренно используют поддержку США для эскалации напряженности в регионе. ""Я подтверждаю, что наша политика в Южно-Китайском море остается неизменной, - сказал Сунь Цзяньго. - У Китая достаточно мудрости и терпения для того, чтобы преодолеть разногласия мирным путем переговоров. Я верю, что и у других государств есть мудрость и терпение для того, чтобы идти с Китаем путем мира. Страны, не имеющие непосредственного отношения к проблемам, не должны саботировать мирный путь, исходя из эгоистичных целей"".

Чиновники предлагают ввести в России пособие по бедности. А другие - убрать?,"0 комментариев 1 поделились источник Pravda.Ru 
Как рассказала первый замминистра финансов Татьяна Нестеренко, сейчас финансовая поддержка больше всего необходима семьям с детьми в возрасте до 16 лет, особенно в ней нуждаются ""семьи с двумя и более детьми и одним работающим родителем"". 
""Сегодня было бы правильно и нам перейти на применение принципа нуждаемости при назначении отдельных социальных выплат и обсудить возможность введения нового вида пособия - пособия по бедности"", - добавила Нестеренко. 
По словам чиновницы, прежде чем вводить новый вид пособий, сперва стоит определить понятие ""нуждаемость"" и его критерии на законодательном уровне. 
Предложения министерства не отражены в проекте бюджета на 2017-2019 годы, добавила Нестеренко. 
Ранее председатель Правительства РФ Дмитрий Медведев подписал постановление о снижении величины прожиточного минимума. 
Как пояснил Правде.Ру член комитета Совета Федерации по экономической политике Николай Власенко, ""это стоит воспринимать как техническую вещь. Есть правила определения прожиточного минимума. Они ежеквартально корректируются. В третьем квартале он был несколько завышен из-за инфляции, которая у нас носит сезонный характер. Одновременно, например, снижение покупательского спроса, запускает дефляционные процессы. У нас сейчас специфическая ситуация в экономике - называется биполярная инфляция и дефляция "". 
По мнению эксперта Правды.Ру, в некоторых секторах инфляция идет опережающими темпами, а в каких-то есть даже дефляция. Получилось, что в четвертом квартале по тем товарным группам, по которым идентифицируется прожиточный минимум, произошло снижение. Во многом из-за того, что в третьем квартале был существенный рост. Эксперт напомнил, что прожиточный минимум - техническая цифра, к которой ""привязаны"" размеры социальных пособий, субсидий на ЖКХ и многое другое. Но самое важное - это социально-демографический ориентир, порог бедности. 
Правда.ру ранее писала, что поступало предложение ввести продовольственные карточки для бедных россиян. 
Отметим, что использование продуктовых карточек для поддержки малообеспеченных людей является довольно распространенной в мире практикой, к примеру, в США активно применяется система Food stamp. На сегодняшний день около 21% американцев подают заявки на получение ежемесячных социальных пособий. 
Кстати, ранее с предложением ввести продовольственные карточки в России выступала ФАС. Доктор экономических наук, профессор Владимир Мантусов в интервью Правда.Ру сообщил, что введение продуктовых талонов не вызовет никакой паники среди населения, так как это является обычной мерой социальной поддержки. Однако, отметил эксперт, основной целью должно быть истребление бедности и нищеты в стране для того, чтобы люди не нуждались в бесплатных продуктах.

В России впервые успешно испытали гиперзвуковую ракету,"Политика » Силовые структуры » Министерство обороны Гиперзвуковой летательный аппарат, известный как ""изделие 4202"" или ""15Ю71"" 25 октября впервые успешно прошел испытания в ходе стрельб из пускового района Домбаровский в Оренбургской области по камчатскому полигону Кура. Все бортовое оборудование, электронные комплексы, а также система управления полностью состоят из российских комплектующих. 0 комментариев 5 поделились 
Как пишут ""Известия"", оружие способно развивать на максимальной высоте скорость порядка 15 Max, или 7 км/сек. Аппарат предназначен для установки на перспективные межконтинентальные баллистические ракеты, вместо традиционных боеголовок. ""4202"" начинает работать на высоте порядка 100 км и летит к цели на скорости 5-7 км/с. А перед входом в плотные слои атмосферы непосредственно над целью гиперзвуковой летательный аппарат совершает сложный маневр, который затрудняет его перехват средствами противоракетной обороны. 
Отметим, проект гиперзвуковых боевых блоков под названием ""Альбатрос"" появился в СССР еще в середине 1980-х годов, как ответ на попытку США создать противоракетную оборону в рамках концепции ""Звездных войн"". Однако, из-за технических сложностей проект был закрыт. В середине 1990-х годов Научно-производственное объединение(НПО) машиностроения возобновило разработку, но уже под обозначением ""4202"". 
По словам источников в госкорпорации ""Роскосмос"", проведению успешных летных испытаний гиперзвукового летательного аппарата предшествовала обширная программа импортозамещения. Пришлось избавиться от системы управления, ранее изготавливаемой харьковским предприятием ""Хартрон"", и некоторых других комплектующих. Успешно реализованная программа дала возможность возобновить испытания. Сейчас бортовое оборудование, электронные комплексы, а также система управления теперь полностью состоят из российских комплектующих. 
Как рассказал главный редактор интернет-проекта Militaryrussia Дмитрий Корнев, в ""4202"" изначально было не так уж и много иностранных комплектующих, однако ключевой элемент изделия — система управления, контролирующая полет летательного аппарата, выполнение им гиперзвукового маневра и наведение на цель, изготавливалась украинским предприятием. 
""НПО машиностроения начало разработку новой системы управления еще в 2014 году. Вероятно, ее начали испытывать в 2015 году, однако оба пуска ""4202"" прошли неудачно. 25 октября нынешнего года пуск удался, что свидетельствует об успешной работе НПО маш по импортозамещению"", — сказал Корнев ""Известиям"". 
Ранее Pravda. Ru писала, что гиперзвуковое оружие к 2020 году должно поступить на вооружение российской армии. Развитие высокоскоростных зенитных ракет привело к тому, что практически любой современный самолет или даже ракета могут быть с высокой долей вероятности перехвачены и сбиты на любой высоте. Ну, а выход из создавшегося положения может быть только один — создать летательные аппараты способные лететь быстрее ракет-перехватчиков. 
Вот поэтому-то ведущие державы мира, такие как США, Россия и Китай в спешном порядке занялись созданием гиперзвуковых летательных аппаратов разных типов и предназначения, то есть включились в очередное противоборство ""меча и щита"". 
Китай, например, еще 9 января 2015 года испытал гиперзвуковой планер WU-14, запускаемый в космос при помощи межконтинентальной баллистической ракеты. Затем развивая скорость в 10 М, то есть более 12,3 тыс. км/ч он сверху пикирует на цель. Современные средства противовоздушной обороны летящую на такой скорости цель отследить и перехватить не могут. 
Так что теперь и Китай стал третьей в мире страной, после России и США, у которой есть технологии гиперзвуковых носителей как ядерного, так и обычного оружия. По сути, у китайцев получалась боеголовка с управляющими поверхностями, которая может маневрировать в полете и потому-то она и практически неуязвима. Но собственного двигателя у этого аппарата нет, так что это очередное оружие для ""самых бедных"". 
В России же идут работы над ракетами разных типов с гиперзвуковыми прямоточными воздушно-реактивными двигателями (ГПВРД), которые можно будет запускать с земли, с кораблей или с боевых самолетов.

Провал за провалом: В США похитили списки шпионов-нелегалов,"0 комментариев 3 поделились источник Pravda.Ru 
Как сообщает Associated Press со ссылкой на документы судебных органов, ""секретная информация, украденная бывшим подрядчиком Агентства национальной безопасности, включает в себя имена тайных сотрудников разведки"". 
По данным Российской газеты, защита 51-летнего Гарольда Томаса Мартина III Глен Берни будет просить федерального судью в пятницу рассмотреть вопрос об освобождении его клиента из-под стражи на том основании, что следствие по этому делу продолжается. 
Судья Дэвид Кпперзайт отклонил подобную просьбу на прошлой неделе, согласившись с прокуратурой, что освобождение Мартина представляет риск, якобы потому, что ""враги Соединенных Штатов хотели бы узнать больше о секретной информации, найденной в его доме"". 
Защита Мартина настаивает на версии, что бывший лейтенант ВМС США просто ""увлекся"", взяв документы на дом в надежде усовершенствовать свои навыки и стать более опытным специалистом в своем деле. 
Адвокаты говорят, что их клиент ""любит свою семью и свою страну"", и что нет никаких доказательств того, что он поделился информацией с иностранным государством или намеревался сделать это. 
Фирма Booz Allen Hamilton, где он работал, уволила Мартина, как только узнала о его аресте, и заявила в четверг, что наняла бывшего директора ФБР Роберта Мюллера, чтобы пересмотреть свою практику безопасности. 
Как сообщает Reuters, Гарольд Томас Мартин работал в той же компании Booz Allen Hamilton, что и Эдвард Сноуден. Напомним, Сноуден в 2013 году передавший в прессу разоблачительные материалы о действиях спецслужб США. 
По словам помощника генерального прокурора США по национальной безопасности Джона Карлина, ""возможна ситуация, когда ""во второй раз за три года сотрудник сумел похитить у АНБ строго засекреченную информацию, нанеся серьезный ущерб"". 
Сообщается, что изначально Мартин отрицал свою вину, но позже на допросе в ФБР признался в краже секретных данных. 
Ранее электронная версия The New York Times сообщила, что сотрудники Федерального бюро расследований (ФБР) арестовали подрядчика Агентства национальной безопасности (АНБ) по подозрению в краже и раскрытии ""строго секретных кодов, разработанных для взлома сетей правительств других государств"", в том числе России.

ЕС намерен расширить санкции в отношении Сирии,"0 комментариев 0 поделились источник Pravda.Ru 
Как пишет Wall Street Journal, ссылаясь на свои источники, санкционные репрессии могут быть направлены против министров и их заместителей из правительства Сирии. 
По данным издания, в ЕС не будут тянут время, и, скорее всего, список будет расширен уже на следующей неделе. 
Отметим, в настоящее время в санкционных сирийских списках Европейского союза находятся более 200 человек и около 70 организаций. Напомним, недавно еще пять стран, не входящие в ЕС, но поддерживающие политику Брюсселя, продлили еще на полгода санкции против России . В список этих стран вошли Украина, Черногория, Албания, а также Лихтенштейн и Норвегия, входящие в Европейское экономическое пространство. 
Что заставило руководителей этих стран принять такое решение, рассказал Pravda.Ru старший научный сотрудник Института славяноведения РАН Петр Искендеров. 
- Какие у этих стран причины для присоединения к санкциям? 
- Позиция Черногории связана с позицией правящей элиты, которая одержала победу на днях на очередных парламентских выборах, - конкретно, премьер-министра Мило Джукановича. Он провозгласил вступление в ЕС и НАТО своим ключевым внешнеполитическим приоритетом. И понятно, что внешняя политика Черногории полностью находится в русле Брюсселя. 
Если говорить об Албании, то эта страна уже является членом НАТО. Она тоже активно пытается продвинуть свою заявку на вступление в Европейский союз и четко солидаризируется по внешнеполитическим вопросам с ключевыми лидерами ЕС, такими как Франция, Германия и Италия. А поскольку все эти страны пока официально не блокируют антироссийские санкции, подобного нельзя ожидать и от Албании. Ее внешняя политика полностью солидаризируется с политикой ЕС. 
Лихтенштейн - это карликовое государство, которое финансово и экономически связано с государствами Центральной Европы, прежде всего со Швейцарией, Австрией, Бельгией, Голландией, Германией. Поэтому от этого государства ожидать самостоятельности во внешней политике не приходится. 
В Норвегии другая ситуация. Эта страна полностью самодостаточная и в политическом, и в энергетическом плане, она не является членом ЕС, но связана с Брюсселем торгово-экономическими соглашениями. Кроме того, Норвегия является одним из конкурентов России в том, что касается освоения Арктического шельфа, это наш конкуренты на энергетическом рынке, в плане снабжения Европейского союза газом. И в принципе, Норвегия среди скандинавских стран традиционно занимает наиболее ярко выраженную антироссийскую позицию, по сравнению даже с Финляндией и Швецией.

Компания Alibaba открыла вакансию кота,"0 комментариев 0 поделились 
Как сообщает Crienglish.com, кота компания рассчитывает найти до 10 ноября. В этот день в преддверии крупнейшего в КНР торгового фестиваля состоится гала-вечер интернет-магазина Tmall (его символом является черный кот). В Alibaba рассчитывают, что животное станет объектом для новых мемов и вирусных видео, а также увеличит продажи. 
Ранее Alibaba ранее уже удалось привлечь ставших популярными в сети котов, к примеру, сердитого котика из США (Grumpy Cat), кота по кличке Анри из Франции, Мару из Японии. В должности заинтересованы Милк и Орео из Великобритании, а также китайские коты, сообщает портал. 
Напомним, компания Alibaba основана в 1999 году. В ее структуру входит десяток интернет-площадок, в том числе AliExpress, Taobao и китайское подразделение Yahoo!. 
Американские ученые пришли к выводу, что гладить кошек - опасно для здоровья. 
В ходе исследований ученые выяснили, что близкое общение с кошками опасно для человеческой жизни, сообщает РИА VladNews со ссылкой на Информинг. 
Согласно исследованиям, домашние любимцы передают своим хозяевам инфекции чаще, чем считалось ранее. Результат исследования показал, что кошачьи царапины, которые появляются в ходе общения между кошками и их хозяевами, могут привести к серьезному заболеванию - «кошачьей лихорадке». 
Ранки от кошачьих ногтей могут спровоцировать высокую температуру и даже могут стать причиной летального исхода. 
По словам специалистов, не следует заводить кошек, когда в доме есть маленькие дети, а также после общения с животными следует тщательно мыть руки. 
Специалисты-фелинологи уже полгода ведут наблюдение за хвостатыми подопытными и к 2021 году обещают объяснить, что означает вся гамма издаваемых нашими любимцами звуков. 
Исследователи в процессе опыта записывают все звуки, которые выдают 50 подопытных котов, когда они голодны, испуганы, ищут ласки или просто довольны. 
Полученные результаты анализируют и классифицируют. Уже установлено, что кошки способны изменять интонацию или мелодику осознанно, желая донести до хозяина определенную информацию, делится наблюдениями специалист в области фонетики Сусанна Шетц . Например, когда кошка просит еду, она мяукает тоньше. 
По мнению фелинологов, вербальное общение - не главное средство связи этих животных с человеком: диалог в основном идет на языке тела и запахов. Некоторые проблемы во взаимопонимании возникают еще и потому, что по сравнению с собаками, и уж тем более людьми, мурки имеют очень мало лицевых мышц. Впрочем, научившись шифровать эмоции, сами они легко считывают информацию с лиц хозяев.

"Американка, заболевшая раком от присыпки Johnson & Johnson, отсудила $70 млн","0 комментариев 0 поделились 
Как сообщает Associated Press, жительница города Модесто в Калифорнии Дебора Джаннекини длительное время пользовалась детской присыпкой Johnson & Johnson. В 2012 году врачи обнаружили у нее рак яичников. 
Как заявил адвокат истца Джим Ондер, суд в очередной раз подтвердили необходимость компании Johnson & Johnson предупреждать людей о риске развития рака яичников в связи с использованием этого продукта. 
Однако представители компании отрицают данный факт и собираются обжаловать вердикт. 
""Мы очень сочувствуем этой женщине и семьям, пострадавшим от рака яичников. Мы намерены обжаловать сегодняшний вердикт, потому что руководствуемся наукой, которая подтверждает безопасность присыпки Johnson's Baby"", — сообщила представительница компании Кэрол Гудрич. 
Напомним, это уже не первый подобный случай. В феврале Pravda.Ru сообщала , что американский суд обязал крупного производителя косметических товаров Johnson & Johnson выплатить $72 миллионов родственникам женщины, скончавшейся от рака. 
Как пишет РИА Новости, суд в Миссури вынес такое решение в деле Жаклин Фокс, которая скончалась от рака яичников в октябре 2015 года в возрасте 62 лет. Родственники утверждали, что болезнь развилась у женщины после того, как она в течение более 35 лет регулярно пользовалась продукцией американской компании, в том числе средствами для интимной гигиены и детской присыпкой. 
Соответственно, жюри присяжных признало конгломерат виновным в мошенничестве и сокрытии информации о том, что его продукция может нанести непоправимый вред здоровью. В Johnson & Johnson заявили, что разочарованы вердиктом, однако не уточнили, будет ли компания обжаловать решение суда. 
Компания Johnson & Johnson, основанная в 1886 году, является одним из крупнейших в мире производителей косметических и санитарно-гигиенических товаров и медицинского оборудования. Занимает 37-е место в списке Fortune 500, куда включаются самые крупные компании США по версии американского журнала Fortune. 
Ранее фармацевтическое подразделение компании Johnson & Johnson выплатило штраф в размере 2,2 миллиарда долларов за рекламу без одобрения властей США сильнодействующих психиатрических препаратов для использования детьми, пожилыми людьми и инвалидами.

"""Для Порошенко главные ветераны войны — бандеровцы""","0 комментариев 0 поделились Фото: АР 
Впервые эта дата в государственном календаре праздников появилась в 2009 году. Какое значение событие имеет сейчас для страны, рассказал Pravda.Ru украинский политолог Владимир Скачко. 
— Что этот день означает для нынешней украинской власти? 
— Означает то, что в головах нынешних украинских властей не поддающийся лечению когнитивный диссонанс. С одной стороны, они проводят декоммунизацию, обвиняют Советский Союз, в составе которого была Украинская Советская Социалистическая Республика, в развязывании войны. И прославляют ОУН-УПА, союзника гитлеровского вермахта. 
А с другой стороны, сегодня они, во главе с президентом и премьер-министром, возлагали цветы к монументам, поздравляли еще живущих ветеранов, вообще жителей страны, в том числе и тех же бандеровцев, с праздником освобождения от немецко-фашистских захватчиков. 
Украинская власть никак не может определиться — она потомок советских победителей, или все-таки гитлеровских прихвостней? Тут сложно что-то комментировать. Это чисто политически игра — гнусная, циничная, можно даже сказать, подлая. 
Таким образом, украинская власть пытается оправдаться перед теми людьми, которые действительно спасли Украину от фашизма, и которым последние 2,5 года усиленно плюют в душу. Даже не плюют, а вываливают целые составы нечистот. 
— То есть это такой ""черный день"" для администрации Порошенко? 
— Да почему ""черный"", эти люди абсолютно беспринципны. Они одной рукой поглаживают бюст Адольфа Гитлера, другой — поправляют усы на бюсте Иосифа Сталина. Если это приносит им дивиденды, позволяет удерживаться во власти и дальше грабить эту несчастную страну. 
Порошенко поздравлял ветеранов УПА и назначил День защитника Отечества на день создания УПА. У нас день рождения этой огромной зондеркоманды является Днем защитника — 14 октября. И буквально через две недели он поздравляет тех, кому стреляли в спину. Это политическая шизофрения — размером в целую страну. 
Напомним, ранее Pravda.Ru писала, что Верховная Рада Украины приняла Декларацию памяти и солидарности парламентов Украины, Польши и Литвы по событиям Второй мировой войны. Данный документ не только возлагает на СССР вину за начало Второй мировой войны, но и утверждает, что Ялтинские соглашения лидеров антигитлеровской коалиции, закрепившие победу над фашизмом, стали основой ""порабощения всей Восточной и Центральной Европы"". 
""Пакт Риббентропа-Молотова от 23 августа 1939 года, заключенный между двумя тоталитарными режимами — коммунистическим Советским Союзом и нацистской Германией, привел к взрыву 1 сентября Второй мировой войны, вызванной агрессией Германии, к которой 17 сентября присоединился Советский Союз. Следствием тех событий была оккупация Польши Германией и Советским Союзом, a в 1940 году — советская оккупация Литвы, Латвии и Эстонии. Следствием этого стали массовые репрессии против наших народов"", — цитирует документ украинское издание ""112"".

"""Гражданам мира"" нужно не Отечество, а собственное спокойствие""","0 комментариев 0 поделились Герман Греф. Фото: Fotodom.ru/Коммерсантъ 
""Настоящие патриоты — те люди, которые пытаются все время очень много работать над собой, над своим бизнесом, над своими учреждениями с тем, чтобы соответствовать и даже немного опережать время. Это очень тяжело, это не всегда популярно, это всегда связано с тем, что приходится меняться самому и менять окружающих, влиять на изменение окружающих"", — заявил Герман Греф. 
Прокомментировал его слова председатель правления советов директоров Pravda.Ru Вадим Горшенин: 
- Вот определение того же слова от словаря Ушакова: ""человек, преданный своему народу, любящий свое отечество, готовый на жертвы и совершающий подвиги во имя интересов своей родины"". 
А это по словарю Даля: ""любитель отечества, ревнитель о благе его, отчизнолюб, отечественник или отчизник"". 
Обратили внимание, что из определения Грефа выпало, как абсолютно ненужное, даже упоминание Отечества ? 
На мой взгляд, Греф с этим определением — один из того распространенного типа чиновников в России на высоких постах, которые являются ""гражданами мира"" и смогут нормально себя чувствовать при любом государственном режиме: демократическом, авторитарном, оккупационном — каким угодно. 
Когда-то, если помните, в конце восьмидесятых — начале девяностых прошлого века в стране, с подачи партии старовойтовых, ельциных, бурбулисов ""Демократической России"" резко поменялись все политические определения. И традиционно левых коммунистов, выступающих за равные возможности для всех, общественную собственность и т. д., начали называть ""правыми"", а тех, кто продвигал частную собственность на средства производства, землю, природные ресурс, — ""левыми"". 
В результате ""левые"" совершили переворот с помощью руцких и теперь стесняются так называться. Спросите того же Грефа — левый он или правый политик. Как думаете, что ответит? 
И сейчас есть у меня такое чувство, что ""граждане мира"", они же космополиты, пытаются сделать то же самое, но уже с более глубокими понятиями для каждого человека, любящего свое Отечество (как в России, так и в Америке, Франции, Германии, Сирии и т. д.)… 
Обратите внимание, как сейчас в либеральных изданиях начнут распространять эту откровенную идеологическую чушь от главы Сбербанка, как начнут ее цитировать оппозиционные блогеры. А когда обратите, попробуйте ответить на вопрос: почему ее никогда не повторят, например, Сергей Лавров или Сергей Шойгу. Почему она дико смотрелась бы, припиши ее кто-то Суворову, Кутузову, Екатерине II, Столыпину? 
Или я опять пытаюсь отстаивать ""замшелые истины"", как мне указали в одном из комментариев?

К примеру, согласно данным, представленным нардепом на сайте е-декларирования, у него в личном пользовании имеется.. Храм Успения Пресвятой Богородицы в Винницкой области. Храм, правда, небольшой - площадью всего в 41 квадратный метр. Стоимость этого имущества на сайте не указана. 
Есть у депутата, как указано в декларации, три квартиры, две из которых (117,1 м. кв. и 114,5 м. кв.) находятся в Киеве, а третья - в Виннице (78 м. кв.) 
Кроме того, Матвиенко в декларации указал земельные участки в Винницкой области (5 гектар и 1,5 га). Более гектара земли под Киевом в с. Лисники (1,2 га) записаны на его жену. 
Также замглавы БПП задекларировал два гаража (43,8 м. кв и 14,5 м.кв), один из которых является его собственностью, а второй - жены. Семье Матвиенко принадлежат дом в Ивано-Франковской области (107,3 м. кв.) и домовладение в Лисниках (839,8 м. кв.). 
Кроме того, нардеп в декларации указал собственную небольшую комнату в 62 квадратных метра, которая находится в доме отдыха Госуправления делами в Конча-Заспе. 
Еще более интересна декларация главы Национальной полиции Украины Хатии Деканоидзе, В ней указан годовой доход чиновницы в 3,5 млн гривен, автомобиль Hyundai Elantra 2012 выпуска, который куплен в 2013 году за 103129 гривен, три 3 квартиры в Грузии и земельный участок там же общей площадью 1800 кв. м. 
Собственно сама зарплата Деканоидзе не так уж и велика - за прошлый год она составила 88 760 гривен, а вот за работу в компании MPRI International Services LTD, an Corporation Engility ей выплатили 3 431 846 грн. 
И.о. министра здравоохранения Украины Ульяна Супрун задекларировала в Едином госреестре деклараций квартиру в Киеве, более 4,3 млн долларов и почти 66 тыс. гривен наличными. При этом общая заработная плата, полученная по основному месту работы Супрун в 2015 году, равна 36 тыс. гривен. 
Напомним, как сообщала Правда.Ру, интересная недвижимость обнаружилась у генпрокурора Украины Юрия Луценко. в Киеве ему принадлежит целое жилое здание, а в Крыму - квартира, стоимостью в $1 млн. Все это, конечно, было оформлено на подставных лиц. О ""находке"" рассказал депутат Верховной рады Сергей Лещенко.

"Как заткнуть ""черные дыры"" бюджетов","Экономика » Правила игры » Законодательство Счетная палата РФ выявила серьезные проблемы с формированием и исполнением бюджетов регионов, отсутствие конкретных целей социально-экономического развития, а также эффективного механизма поддержки таких регионов. За последние три года госдолг почти всех высокодотационных регионов увеличился в среднем на четверть. Ситуацию для Pravda.Ru анализирует заместитель генерального директора Международного центра развития регионов Олег Столяров. Регионы превратили в должников — С чем связаны нынешние финансовые проблемы регионов, только ли с кризисом? Или причины более глубокие? — Во многом это последствия неправильной федеральной политики. Не так давно центр принял решение, чтобы регионы заместили кредиты коммерческих банков более дешевыми федеральными кредитами. Тем самым регионы подсадили на дешевую иглу. Приведу пример: с конца 1990-х годов и до недавнего времени в Москве действовала инвестиционно-заемная система. Столица выпускала облигации и вырученные от их продажи средства инвестировала в городскую экономику. Любой покупатель облигации размещал свои средства с хорошим доходом, как минимум покрывающим инфляцию, тогда как в крупном банке он разместил бы их лишь под 4 процента годовых. Нынешняя московская власть прекратила эту практику — мол, зачем занимать на открытом рынке, если теперь есть возможность взять в долг у государства? И Москва, богатейший регион страны, стала должником федерального бюджета . Сейчас в российской экономике очень сжата денежная масса — всего 0,43 процента ВВП. То есть средняя ""длина"" денег 2,5-3 месяца максимум, а для развития экономики необходимы именно ""длинные"" деньги. Сегодня, согласно подсчетам, на руках у населения находится 24 триллиона рублей, и государство не дает ему никакого инструмента для инвестирования их в экономику, кроме банковских депозитов и накоплений пенсионных фондов, по мизерным ставкам ниже инфляции. При таком положении дел сбережений не сделаешь, они сгорают. — Каким может быть предельный уровень долгов регионов? Что будет, если регион окажется не в состоянии оплатить долг? — А они все не в состоянии оплатить. Сегодня в распоряжении региона остается максимум 35 процентов доходов, генерируемых на его территории. И на федеральном уровне никак не могут установить минимальные социальные стандарты и, соответственно, определить сумму, которая будет оставаться в том или ином регионе для минимальной социальной обеспеченности его жителей. Нынешняя системе распределения доходов приводит к тому, что регионы-доноры постепенно ""схлопываются"", предприятия прячут прибыль и не инвестируют ее. При фактической рентабельности в 40 процентов у многих предприятий, в отчетах они показывают 4-5 процентов, чтобы постоянно жаловаться на невозможность взять кредиты. ""Работа"" денег в экономике — это в первую очередь размещение их в ценные бумаги предприятий, в том числе и социальных. Между прочим, во всем мире здравоохранение — прибыльная отрасль, и только в России оно — ""черная дыра"" для бюджета . В любом районном диагностическом центре высокотехнологичное оборудование используется одну смену (соответственно, при мизерных квотах для пациентов), а остальные 16 часов в день оно простаивает. А ведь его можно было бы сдавать в аренду — желающие найдутся. Знаю известнейший в Москве госпиталь, который при возможности делать 1200 операций по коронарографии имеет квоту всего на 300 операций. Аналогичные резервы есть в образовании. Наше государство неэффективно задействует социальную сферу, делая упор на адресную социальную помощь. Но эта адресная социальная помощь, как вы помните, завершилась монетизацией льгот, в результате которой дополнительные деньги получили те, кто на эти льготы не имеет права, а нуждающимся не хватило. Чиновники почесали головы… и добавили еще денег — вот и вся социальная политика. Вложения — расходы или доходы? — На какие цели регионы сегодня занимают деньги? — Регионы обязали выполнять майские указы президента. Они их почти все выполнили, кроме первого — создания 25 миллионов высокопроизводительных рабочих мест. А по сути, с него и надо было начинать. Сначала выполните ""доходный"" указ, увеличьте свою налоговую базу! А потом уже выполняйте социальные обязательства — повышайте зарплату учителям, врачам, бюджетникам, оснащайте подстанции скорой помощи, школы, амбулаторные учреждения. Вместо этого чиновники с энтузиазмом приступили к исполнению ""расходных"" указов — образовался дефицит бюджета. Все регионы привыкли к такой практике: две трети собранных доходов они отдают в федеральный бюджет, а потом обращаются за помощью в казначейство. Казначейство выдает запрошенные суммы в конце года, когда остается только наспех залатать дыры, а остаток, которым не успели залатать, ""сжечь"". Обратите внимание: результаты исполнения бюджета текущего квартала обнародуются только через квартал после его завершения. В стране нет текущего мониторинга исполнения бюджета. В начале года проектируется некий дефицит, к середине года образуется профицит — ""лишние"" деньги судорожно распихиваются по всем направлениям. Это у нас стандартная ежегодная политика. А самое главное, нельзя забывать, что бюджет состоит из двух частей — доходной и расходной. Программы развития заносятся только в расходную часть, это все гордо называется программным бюджетом. А ведь смысл в том, чтобы они, прежде всего, генерировали региону доходы. Но об этом догадываются лишь единицы из числа региональных руководителей. Для большинства уже стало аксиомой: программа — это расходы. Послушайте любое совещание на высоком уровне: столько-то вложений в такую-то программу, столько-то субсидий выдано. А что в результате получили, какова эффективность? Вот в чем весь вопрос. Пока деньги просто ""выстреливают"" в пространство, в ""черную дыру"", а потом пишется бумажка для отчета, в которой эта пресловутая эффективность высасывается из пальца… — В чем выход из создавшейся ситуации? — Здесь уместно вернуться к началу нашего разговора и вспомнить модель выхода из кризиса США в 1939 году. Корпорациям и городам разрешили выпускать облигации. Этими облигациями были профинансированы и выход из депрессии, и строительство инфраструктуры, и, в конечном счете, экономический рост.

Телемедицина — лечебный прорыв или фикция?,"Здоровье » Здоровье и профилактика Гос д ум е предстоит рассмотреть законопроект о телемедицине . В каких случаях врачам следует разрешить консультировать пациента дистанционно? Можно ли ставить диагноз на расстоянии? Что сейчас препятствует развитию телемедицины в России? Об этом в прямом эфире видеостудии Pravda.Ru рассказал член правления Общества врачей России Айрат Ханов. 0 комментариев 0 поделились Фото: Fotodom.ru/DP 
— Каковы аргументы ""за"" и ""против"" телемедицины ? Что медики понимают под телемедициной, и не расходится ли это понимание с тем, что представляют себе авторы законопроектов? 
— Если придерживаться буквы определения, то телемедицина — это дистанционные медицинские услуги. По факту, практически каждый врач и многие из граждан нашей страны телемедицинскими услугами пользуются уже много лет. Телефонные консультации, например, — это также телемедицина, потому что врач на расстоянии по телефону дает рекомендации пациенту. Например, врач может увеличить дозу препарата, заменить его на другой препарат или же пригласить больного к себе на прием. 
Медицина развивается в связи с тем, что появляются современные средства передачи любой информации — визуальной, письменной и так далее. Ведь интернет развивается. 
В настоящее время во всем мире телемедицина движется вперед уже большими темпами. И как нам показывают цифры зарубежных источников, там при этом экономят до 40 процентов средств на медицинских услугах. К сожалению, у нас пока это все хотя и не запрещено, но и не разрешено, не прописано законодательно. 
— Медикам действительно нужно, чтобы это явление узаконили? Или, в принципе, как они работали без этого, так и будут нормально работать? 
— Я думаю, что нужно, чтобы это узаконили. 
— А почему? 
— Потому что в медицинском процессе участвуют два человека, две стороны: врач и пациент. И в этой ситуации важно сделать новое максимально удобным , чтобы это облегчало работу врача, улучшало ее и было удобно для пациента. Без этого могут возникнуть юридические проблемы. 
Например, когда пациент что-то не так поймет, сам сделает что-то не так, как врач прописал, и из-за этого будут какие-то осложнения, потом он может предъявить врачу юридические претензии. И вот тут возникает проблема, потому что у нас телемедицина не регламентирована. 
— То есть может иметь значение, что рекомендация была дана по телефону или по интернету? А если бы сидели офлайн, претензий бы не было? 
— Да, потому что информация может исказиться по ходу донесения. Не так услышал, не так понял. 
— Но это же может это и в очном разговоре случиться? 
— Конечно, но это будет рассматриваться в юридических органах на основе регламентирующих документов, законов. А если порядок не прописан, то сложностей для всех возникнет намного больше. Сейчас в России, согласно законодательству, по лицензионным требованиям медицинская услуга должна оказываться по месту действия лицензии, то есть вот только в этом здании, даже не в соседнем. 
— В каких случаях может применяться телемедицина без ущерба для качества лечения? 
— Телемедицина нужна, конечно, в первую очередь, для приближения медицинской помощи. Если где-то населенный пункт расположен за 500-700 километров от центральной районной больницы, нет медицинского работника рядом, — чтобы до него добраться, нужны сутки или двое. А если есть связь — телефонная или интернет, — и человеку страждущему нужно оказать помощь именно сейчас, телемедицина может сильно помочь, приблизить лечение. 
Во-вторых, телемедицина нужна, когда нужно решить медицинские вопросы между врачом и пациентом уже, например, для уточнения каких-то позиций — результатов анализов или корректировки назначения лечения. Бывает также, что иногда пациенты едут за сотни километров, чтобы получить от врача одноминутную консультацию, хотя сейчас ее легко можно получить по телефону или через интернет. Через современные телемедицинские системы в письменном виде на сайте это сделать особенно легко и удобно. 
— Но врачу, что бы минуту уделить пациенту очно, по интернету или телефону, все равно нужно эту минуту выделить. То есть здесь получается проблема — не нагрузят ли врачей, если им теперь дополнительно онлайн консультировать? Где им взять еще время? 
— Вот как раз закон и нужен для того, чтобы наш Фонд обязательного медицинского страхования прописал в перечне услуг эту статью — телемедицинская консультация и за нее финансировал лечебные учреждения. Нужен закон. Если визит повторный, уточняющий, почему бы, если пациент находится где-то далеко, не использовать возможности телемедицины? Тогда можно сэкономить на времени пациента и врача. И тогда врач в сэкономленное время может принять другого больного. Кстати, в мировой практике очень много приборов, подсоединенных к телемедицинским портам. 
— Какие это дает возможности? 
— Во-первых, можно снять кардиограмму, отправить ее врачу за тысячу километров, где он может расшифровать кардиограмму и прислать свои советы. Можно прибором, который присоединен к специализированному порталу, измерить сахар в крови. Можно измерить артериальное давление, пульс, пульсосимметрию сделать… 
И в мире уже есть тысячи различных приборов, которые прикрепляются к телу и могут измерять показатели круглые сутки. 
— А у нас как дело с этим обстоит? Насколько мы отстаем от Запада? 
— Мы отстаем именно потому, что у нас нет соответствующего закона, нет систематизации этих вопросов. К сожалению, в этом направлении движения мы немного отстаем и по приборной базе, по программным продуктам, но закон дал бы толчок к ускорению этих процессов.

"Украина пугает Европу ""призраком России""","0 комментариев 0 поделились Фотоархив Правды.Ру 
В беседе Кулеба рассказывал о ""несомненных победах"" Украины на европейскому пространстве, о поддержке позиций Киева европейскими политиками ""которые совсем не устали от украинских проблем"" и о том, что ""все партнеры Украины сейчас оказались перед простым выбором: подыгрывать россиянам либо помогать украинцам"". 
Конечно, вопрос взаимоотношений ПАСЕ и России стороной украинский дипломат обойти не смог. 
""Хотя формально никакого пункта, связанного с Россией, в повестке дня не было, её призрак бродил в зале ПАСЕ. Обсуждали резолюции по Украине и постоянно говорили о России. Выступали президент Франции Франсуа Олланд и министр иностранных дел Германии (Франк. - RT ) Вальтер Штайнмайер и тоже говорили о России"", - заявил Кулеба в интервью Gordon.ua. 
Напомним, как сообщала Правда.Ру, в январе 2017 года Россия может вернуться в Парламентскую ассамблею Совета Европы, но на особых условиях, главное из которых - восстановление всех прав нашей делегации. Чтобы ситуация двухгодичной давности с лишением России права голоса не повторилась, наши депутаты предложили внести изменения в регламент ПАСЕ. Инициатива может быть рассмотрена на декабрьской сессии ассамблеи. 
В начале сентября глава Пар­ла­ментс­кой ас­самб­леи Со­ве­та Ев­ро­пы Педро Аграмунт заявил , что в ходе совместных встреч с главами ведущих политических групп в Москве хотел бы обсудить возобновление диалога с Россией. 
В 2014 и 2015 годах ПАСЕ приняла резолюцию, в которой лишила Россию права голосовать на сессии, права участия в работе уставных органов и в мониторинге выборов. После этого Москва решила не направлять в Ассамблею документы, необходимые для подтверждения полномочий делегации. 
Ситуацию для Pravda.Ru прокомментировал Павел Подлесный, руководитель Центра российско-американских отношений Института США и Канады. 
""Во-первых, Россия из ПАСЕ де-юре не выходила. Мы ушли с определенной сессии, а самой ассамблеи не покидали. Просто пока делегация не возвращается на заседания. Сомневаюсь, что Россия рассчитывала на то, что такой шаг окажет какое-то отрезвляющее воздействие на остальных членов ПАСЕ. 
Во-вторых, ничего нового в действиях ПАСЕ нет. Такие резолюции принимались в прошлом, будут приняты и сейчас. И я убежден, будут приниматься и в будущем. Как надо нам к этому относиться? Дальше бойкотировать заседание или изменить свою позицию? 
""Я должен сказать честно, что этот вопрос сейчас не актуален. Потому что над этим уже будет думать новое руководство Государственной думы, новый состав. А представители Южной Осетии, Абхазии, ДНР и ЛНР как хотят, так пусть и реагируют. Это, честно говоря, никакого значения не имеет в принципе"", - отметил в интервью Правде.Ру эксперт.

Академик Матишов: В Арктике не может быть границ,"0 комментариев 0 поделились Действительный член РАН, директор Мурманского морского биологического института, председатель Южного научного центра РАН Геннадий Матишов 
— Геннадий Григорьевич, в ы регулярно участвуете в заседаниях международной целевой группы Арктического с овета (АС) по вопросам морского сотрудничества в Арктике. Недавно вернулись из США, где в Портленде участвовали в очередном заседании г руппы. Что можно сказать о его итогах? 
— На это заседание собрались представители министерств и ведомств Дании, Исландии, Канады, Норвегии, США, Финляндии, Швеции, организаций коренных народов Арктики (саами, алеуты, инуиты), программ ООН, Всемирного фонда дикой природы и др. Участвовала и российская делегация под председательством МИДа РФ. Стоит подчеркнуть, что заседания группы — это не научные мероприятия. Однако все решения и комментарии подкрепляются научно-обоснованными выводами, согласованными с научной общественностью стран-участниц АС. 
Из мероприятия в Портленде можно сделать однозначный вывод — Арктика едина. Вновь признано, что границы морских экосистем не обязательно совпадают с границами национальной юрисдикции, отдельных государств. Во главу угла положен именно экосистемный подход, а это подразумевает скоординированный подход к управлению морскими районами Арктики, в том числе за пределами национальной юрисдикции. Именно поэтому за столом совета и его групп собрались не только ученые, но и шефы министерств стран-участниц. Не раз отмечалось, что уровень такого представительства необходимо повышать. 
Ясно, что выработка согласованных решений — очень сложное дело. Ведь никто на заседании не отрицал того факта, что прибрежные государства Северного Ледовитого океана обладают суверенными правами над своими участками континентального шельфа. Что арктическое региональное сотрудничество должно вестись так, чтобы не ограничивать указанных прав. Повторю, что интересы нашей страны в Портленде помогал отстаивать представитель российского МИДа. 
Данные обсуждения, как и предшествующие им в Рейкьявике в июне этого года, велись отчасти в контексте работы подготовительного комитета ООН. Там разрабатывается международный юридически обязывающий инструмент (в рамках конвенции ООН по морскому праву) для сохранения и рационального использования морского биологического разнообразия районов, находящихся за пределами национальной юрисдикции. Возможно, в перспективе появятся особо охраняемые морские акватории, в том числе в районе открытого моря в центральной части Северного Ледовитого океана. 
В то же время я считаю, что роль науки в освоении Севера в нашей стране все еще принижена. Уверен, что необходимо инициировать в Российской академии наук отдельную федеральную программу по Арктике и Антарктике. Она должна объединить усилия различных федеральных министерств — транспорта, природных ресурсов и т. д. Программа могла бы способствовать выполнению долгосрочных научно-исследовательских работ в высоких широтах, решению социально-экономических задач. 
— В этом году в Университете Тромсё (Норвегия) прошла уже X международная научная конференция ""Арктические границы — 2016"", в ы там выступили с докладом. Что в нем было главное? 
— Доклад был посвящен радиоэкологическим исследованиям в Арктике Мурманского морского биологического института РАН и Южного научного центра РАН. Я рассказал о наших многолетних исследованиях в сфере атомной безопасности в Баренцевом регионе. Они проводились, в частности, в рамках финско-российско-норвежского проекта по охране окружающей среды и радиационным исследованиям Европейской Арктики. Вот лишь некоторые выводы. 
Так, ученые сравнили существующий уровень содержания искусственных радионуклидов в почвах, дикорастущих грибах и ягодах с аналогичными данными предыдущих лет. Вывод однозначен: на всей территории Евро-Арктического региона наблюдается устойчивое снижение радиоактивного загрязнения всех элементов наземных экосистем. С точки зрения радиационной гигиены употребление в пищу ""продуктов леса"", собранных в северных районах России, Финляндии и Норвегии, абсолютно безопасно. 
Что касается Баренцева моря, то анализ многолетней динамики радиоактивного загрязнения воды, донных отложений и биоты показал: по сравнению с 1960-ми годами активность искусственных радионуклидов многократно снизилась и достигла минимальных значений, возможных в ""ядерную эпоху"". Сыграли свою роль естественные океанологические процессы и радиоактивный распад. 
— Есть ли перспективы совместных исследований по Шпицбергену? 
— В принципе, да. Есть шанс дополнительного финансирования в рамках российско-норвежского сотрудничества от Научно-исследовательского совета Норвегии и РФФИ, возможно, минобрнауки РФ. Заявок на такие проекты традиционно не очень много, поддерживаются в итоге три-четыре проекта. Причем есть условие — должно быть привлечено финансирование со стороны бизнеса в размере 35 процентов. 
Мы рассматриваем возможность своего участия в таких проектах. Они могут быть в области аквакультуры — по выращиванию трески, других видов рыб. Прибавьте такие аспекты, как разработка рецептуры кормов, паразитологические исследования и др. Актуальны исследования по снижению смертности на этапе перехода от личинок к молоди. 
Возможно, стартует совместный проект по губам арктических архипелагов — Шпицбергена и Новой Земли. Есть и другие планы. 
— На юг России все чаще приезжают различные китайские бизнесделегации. Каковы общие точки соприкосновения между учеными наших стран? 
— Многого мы ждем и от сотрудничества с китайскими коллегами. Контакты установили с Университетом города Ланьчжоу, где взялись за изучение одного из самых распространенных видов почв — лёссов — Евразии. Наши партнеры интересуются также климатом в глобальном масштабе. 
Скажете, какая тут связь — почвы и климат? Самая прямая. Есть параллели между изменениями климата и палеопочв. Изучая, какими были почвы в различные геологические эпохи, как они менялись, можно понять, каким был тогда климат. Это своего рода климатическая ""археология"". Правда чтобы продвинуться в ней, одной теории недостаточно — необходима программа бурения почв. Возможно, она появится в рамках российско-китайского проекта по сравнению осадочных хребтов в океане и на суше. Надеемся на поддержку РФФИ и Фонда научных исследований Китая. 
Мы также обсуждаем с китайскими коллегами еще один проект — по разработке подходов к комплексному управлению водными ресурсами и землепользованием в условиях маловодья и динамики климата. География проекта — это наши Приазовье и Нижний Дон, а также Тибетское нагорье и бассейн реки Амур на территории КНР. 
Возможно, в будущем году мы возьмемся за новую научно-исследовательскую программу по изучению ландшафтно-климатических изменений вдоль Великого шелкового пути. Имеется в виду его северная ветка, которая может протянуться от берега Каспия через систему Маныч-Чограй до Азово-Черноморья. В работе смогут участвовать и ученые из Казахстана, Азербайджана и Туркмении. Такая программа полезна для развития сотрудничества стран в рамках стран БРИКС.

"Ученые приблизились к разгадке тайны ""вечной молодости""","0 комментариев 0 поделились 
Как пишет EurekAlert, ученые из медицинского Университета Вашингтона в Сент-Луисе показали, что NMN может компенсировать потерю производства энергии и снижения типичных признаков старения, таких как постепенное увеличение веса, потеря чувствительности к инсулину и снижение физической активности. 
""Мы показали способ замедлить физиологический спад, — рассказал доктор медицинских наук, профессор биологии и медицины Син-ичиро Имаи. — Метаболизм и энергетические уровни старых мышей теперь напоминают молодых"". 
По его словам, клетки человека полагаются на этот же процесс производства энергии, и в дальнейшем технология сможет помочь людям не стареть. Биологи уверены, что что столь впечатляющие результаты актуальны и для человека. Как сообщают ученые, испытания препаратов с NMN на человеке уже начаты в Японии. 
Исследователи отмечают, соединение NMN содержится в таких продуктах как огурцы, авокадо и брокколи. 
Ранее ученые сообщали, что продолжительность человеческой жизни существенно увеличится. Исследователи утверждают, уже в этом тысячелетии она составит в среднем несколько сотен лет. 
По мнению известного британского геронтолога Обри ди Грея, люди, которые будут жить до 150 лет, уже появились на свет, а в ближайшие два-три десятилетия родятся те, чья продолжительность жизни будет составлять уже до 1000 лет. Мы станем жить дольше за счет повышения качества жизни, более продвинутой медицины, разнообразных технологий, предотвращающих старение… 
Сейчас старость ассоциируется у нас с дряхлым телом и болезнями, поэтому многих пугает перспектива долгой жизни. Таким образом, задача состоит не только в том, чтобы ее продлить, а еще и в том, чтобы удлинить период, в течение которого человек будет оставаться активным и трудоспособным. 
Ди Грей полагает, что процесс старения связан с накоплением в организме дефектов и повреждений. Профилактическая гериатрия позволит устранять эти дефекты до того, как их количество превысит критическую отметку. 
В свою очередь, профессор Юваль Харари из Еврейского университета в Иерусалиме пророчит, что люди будущего превратятся в киборгов. Часть жизненных функций будет выполнять легко заменяемая электроника, изношенные органы будут заменяться искусственными, более совершенными, чем естественные, поэтому жить мы будем довольно долго. 
Компания Alphabet Inc. Calico занимается изучением химических соединений, способствующих образованию новых нейронов. Благодаря этим исследованиям, возможно, удастся избавить человечество от болезней Альцгеймера, Паркинсона и других заболеваний, при которых гибнут нервные клетки мозга и которые, как правило, тоже связаны со старением.

Опрос: Россияне одобряют действия президента Путина и правительства,"0 комментариев 4 поделились Фото: AP 
Как показало исследование, рейтинг одобрения деятельности президента с августа по октябрь вырос с 78,7 до 81,8%. Положительные оценки работы правительства также выросли: с 53,6 до 58,3%. 
Лучше стали жители страны относится и к работе Госдумы: в октябре рейтинг одобрения российского парламенте вырос с 39,7% в сентября до 45,5%. Также вырос и рейтинг Совета Федерации с 42,1% до 46,4%. При этом снизилась доля негативных оценок деятельности Госдумы и Совфеда: с 42,8% в сентябре до 34,8% в октябре, с 31,2% до 25,8%, соответственно. 
В сентябре на фоне парламентских выборов полюса оценок сместились (доля отрицательных ответов превысила долю положительных), а в октябре вернулись на прежние места, свидетельствует опрос. 
Практически не изменились за этот период рейтинги одобрения общественных институтов. Исключение - оппозиция - после всплеска в выборный месяц (36,4% в сентябре), оценки снизились, приблизившись к прежним значениям (31,6% в октябре). Работой политических партий в целом довольны 45,1% россиян, обратного мнения придерживаются 32,4%. 
Среди прочих институтов наибольшую поддержку и одобрение россияне выказывают Вооруженным силам страны (83,5%), причем за десять лет эта цифра выросла почти вдвое (с 44% в октябре 2006 года). Также большинство опрошенных положительно оценивают работу Русской Православной церкви (70,4%), средств массовой информации (60,5%). 
Комментируя результаты исследования, генеральный директор ВЦИОМ Валерий Федоров отметил снижение социального самочувствия россиян в январе-августе этого года на фоне ухудшающейся экономической ситуации и одновременное падение рейтингов органов государственной власти. 
""К лету экономическая ситуация стала стабилизироваться, вслед за этим, с лагом в пару месяцев, остановился процесс ухудшения социального самочувствия. В сентябре стабилизация повседневной жизни дошла до политики: тренд развернулся в сторону повышения"", сказал он. 
Опрос ВЦИОМ проведен 22-23 октября в 130 населенных пунктах в 46 областях, краях и республиках и 8 федеральных округах России. Объем выборки 1,6 тысячи человек. 
Напомним, согласно социологическому исследованию, также проведенному ВЦИОМ, несмотря на экономический кризис, число россиян, желающих эмигрировать за границу, за последние годы не увеличилось . 
Как сообщают исследователи, экономический кризис и санкционная политика не оказали влияния на эмиграционные настроения россиян. Доля россиян, желающих уехать за рубеж с 2011 по 2016 года колеблется в пределах 11-13%. При этом 63% из них слабо представляют, когда именно осуществят переезд, и ничего не предпринимают для переезда за границу.

"Откуда в Черногории и Сербии взялись ""русские агенты""","0 комментариев 0 поделились Фото: AP 
Комментировать сообщения о высланных россиянах отказался глава правительства Сербии Александр Вучич. ""Не все в вашем вопросе неверно, одна часть не точна. Я не хотел вам отвечать не только по той причине, которую уже назвал, но и еще из-за одной вещи - потому, что об этих делах я говорить не имею права по закону"", - сказал он белградскому телеканалу N1. 
Новость о депортации российских граждан совпала с неожиданным приездом в Белград секретаря Совбеза РФ Николая Патрушева. Сербские эксперты убеждены, что главная цель визита - обсуждение ситуации в Черногории. 
Прокомментировать ситуацию Pravda.Ru попросила переводчика и журналиста, члена Изборсского клуба, специалиста по внешней торговле, консультанта по вопросам экономического сотрудничества Сербии и России Слободана Стойичевича 
- В Сербии и Черногории уже несколько дней раскручивают скандал об участии россиян в подготовке терактов в Черногории. Кому и зачем это понадобилось? 
- Это, естественно, игра еврофанатиков, которые засели во власти в Сербии. Их не устраивает то, что народ поголовно сейчас встал перед дилеммой: а что дальше? Потому что в последнее время власти так называемой республики Косово поставили вопрос ребром о продолжении переговоров между Косово и Сербией, а еврофанатики во власти в Сербии сейчас не знаю куда дальше идти и что делать. 
Их сейчас больше устраивает раскручивание афер и разных историй с участием якобы русских агентов для отвода глаз от настоящих проблем. Вернее, от тупика, в который они попали со своей ошибочной еврофанатской политикой. Можем этого ожидать и в будущем, что они так же будут действовать. 
И приезд российских политиков - это еще один повод, чтобы продолжить раскручивать разные теории заговора с участием России. Все это делается для отвода глаз народа от насущных проблем, то есть, и дальше заводить все в тупик. А в этом время власти Республики Косово в переговорах с Европой выдвинули ультиматум перед сербским государством. 
- Насколько далеко они готовы пойти? 
- Это зависит от того, как народ среагирует на эти якобы проблемы с ""российскими агентами"". Это просто такой тактический прием, чтобы отвеcти глаза. 
Ситуация с ""российскими шпионами"" зависит и от того, как среагирует Брюссель на заявку Косово. Если Брюссель одобрит политику Косово, что сильно затронет экономический потенциал Сербии, тогда будут раскручивать ситуацию и дальше, выдумывая проблемы. 
Если успокоятся в отношении Косово, тогда сербские власти поубавят нападки на пророссийский электорат. Это просто тактический прием, ничего большего.

Дочь Сердюкова объяснила свое исчезновение,"0 комментариев 10 поделились Фото: Fotodom.ru/DP 
Как сообщил РИА Новости источник, знакомый с ситуацией, полицейские уже опросили девочек, вернувшихся домой. Никто из подростков противоправных действий не совершал. 
По словам источника агентства, дочь бывшего министра обороны, выбросила мобильный телефон возле метро, документов с собой в ""путешествие"" не взяла. 
27 октября в СМИ появилась информация о том, что в Москве без вести пропали две школьницы . 13-летняя Наталья, дочь Анатолия Сердюкова якобы сбежала из дома вместе с 16-летней подругой. К поиску подростков были подключены сотрудники ФСБ РФ. 
В то же время, источник в правоохранительных органах сообщил РИА Новости, что сообщения о пропаже дочери бывшего министра обороны России Анатолия Сердюкова полицию Москвы не поступали. 
Между тем ""МК"" продолжал настаивать на том, что девочки совершили побег. Якобы школьницы запланировали побег еще несколько дней назад и до этого вели себя очень странно. 
По словам родных 16-летней девочки, в выходные школьница купила походную палатку. А 26 октября, надев теплые вещи, немного перекусила и убежала из дома на глазах удивленных родственников. Позже бы найдена записка со словами: ""Я ушла познавать мир"". 
Родители сразу же обратились в полицию. Тогда и выяснилось, что их ребенок сбежал не один, а с подружкой Наташей. Девочки познакомились в интернете, а за день до побега ходили вместе в театр. 
Как ранее сообщали СМИ, перед побегом 13-летняя дочь Сердюкова также оповестила родителей. Девочка отправила маме смс-сообщение: ""Я ухожу из дома"". Однако телефон беглянка отключила не сразу, поэтому аппарат успели запеленговать.

Россия не пустила ВВС Турции в воздушное пространство Сирии,"1 комментариев 9 поделились Фото: AP 
Напомним, как сообщала Правда.Ру, 24 августа турецкая армия начала операцию ""Щит Евфрата"" против террористической группировки ""Исламское государство"" (ИГ, запрещена в России). При участии сирийской оппозиции военные взяли под контроль пограничный город Джараблус на севере Сирии и продолжают наступление на юго-запад. 
По словам президента Турции Тайипа Эрдогана, целью наступления является зачистка от террористов территории размером пять тысяч квадратных километров и создание на ней зоны безопасности для размещения беженцев. На севере Сирии турецкие войска регулярно вступают в столкновения с отрядами курдских ополченцев, которых они считают связанными с Рабочей партией Курдистана. 
Однако в Дамаске иное мнение по этому поводу. Присутствие турецкой армии на территории Сирии власти страны расценивают как нарушение суверенитета страны, способное привести к эскалации конфликта. 
20 октября, после того, как ВВС Турции вновь залетели в Сирию и атаковали позиции курдов под Алеппо, командование армии Сирии предупредило, что не будет терпеть на территории страны турецкие самолеты-нарушители и намерено сбивать их. Сирийские военные также возложили на Турцию ответственность за удары по деревням на севере Алеппо, а также в атаке на Хассаджек. 
Ближний Восток превратился в самую большую мировую головоломку, части которой уже никогда не сойдутся в изначальный рисунок. Потому что региональная специфика, помноженная на западные амбиции, приводит к полному провалу и неразберихе, которые мы имеем сегодня в Сирии. 
Рассмотреть вектор развития российско-турецких отношений, на фоне сирийского конфликта вкупе с западными потугами сохранить демократический имидж предлагает обозреватель Pravda.Ru историк и политолог Икбаль Дюрре . 
Прежде всего, отмечает политолог, надо рассмотреть крайнюю обеспокоенности Анкары по поводу активной поддержки курдов Вашингтоном. И обеспокоенность эта столь велика, что подталкивает Турцию к военному сотрудничеству с Москвой. При этом в Сирии продолжаются совместные действия турецких военных и сирийской свободной армией. 
При этом Запад четко обозначил, что не хочет участия Турции в операциях по спасению Ракии и Мосула. Одним словом, без слез на все эти рокировки не взглянешь. По сути, для Турции ничего не меняется, то она была заложницей ситуации с Россией, то сейчас она может стать заложницей ситуации с США. А за всем этим стоит только одна проблема - вечный конфликт с курдами и нежелание решить этот вопрос в рамках общепринятых демократических основ.

Терпение кончится: Россия ответит на провокации США,"Экспертное мнение Президент России на сессии Валдайского клуба в Сочи заявил, что, несмотря на обещания США разделить террористов и умеренную оппозицию в Сирии, Вашингтон не смог этого сделать. В итоге перемирие оказалось сорвано, а теперь Белый дом винит Кремль во всех смертных грехах. 1 комментариев 3 поделились Владимир Путин. Фото: АР 
""Это просто неприлично. Мы пока ведем себя сдержанно и так же по-хамски нашим партнерам не отвечаем, но все имеет свои границы. Можем и ответить"", — предостерег Владимир Путин. 
Как события могут разворачиваться в дальнейшем рассказал Pravda.Ru политолог, эксперт по российско-американским отношениям Виктор Олевич. 
— Как может ответить Путин? 
— У России есть целый арсенал потенциальных ответов. В данный момент Россия выдерживает определенную паузу в Сирийской Арабской Республике. РФ сейчас не использует весь свой военный потенциал для разрешения сирийского кризиса. 
Но в случае, если США будут заниматься дальнейшими провокациями в адрес России и российских интересов, то, разумеется, Москва может предпринять более активные меры по противодействию тому, что, на самом деле, является террористической угрозой в Сирии, угрозой жизни и благополучию миллионов сирийских граждан. 
— ""Не сработали и наши личные договоренности с президентом США, в Вашингтоне нашлись силы, которые сделали все, чтобы они не были реализованы"", — сожалеет Путин. О каких силах идет речь? 
— В первую очередь, это Пентагон, и американские спецслужбы: ЦРУ, некоторые другие. Которые, действительно, приложили все силы, чтобы похоронить договоренности между Сергеем Лавровым и госсекретарем США Джоном Керри в Женеве. 
Как известно, буквально через несколько дней, после того, как соглашение по Сирии между Москвой и Вашингтоном было достигнуто, американские военные якобы по ошибке разбомбили одни из самых боеготовых сирийских военных частей под Дейр-эз-Зором, и бомбежка эта происходила в течение часа. Погибло от 60 до 80 сирийских военных, и еще больше получили ранения. И, конечно же, после этого говорить о каком-то соглашении было уже невозможно. 
Кроме того, когда Россия подняла этот вопрос в Совете безопасности ООН, американский представитель Саманта Пауэр отреагировала очень резко, и, действительно, по-хамски. Более того, уже через несколько дней подвергся нападению гуманитарный конвой в Алеппо - и США, и их западные союзники совершенно бездоказательно и безосновательно обвинили в этом нападении российских военных. 
Уже на тот момент было совершенно понятно, что глава Пентагона Эштон Картер, ряд американских генералов и глава ЦРУ не заинтересованы в совместной борьбе против террористической угрозы в Сирии против ИГИЛ и ан-Нусры(запрещены в России- ред.). Подтвердились подозрения, что ""ан-Нусра"" на самом деле является своеобразным резервом США, которые они готовы в нужный, в удобный момент использовать для свержения легитимного правительства Сирии во главе с Башаром Асадом. 
Эти неконструктивные силы в США рассчитывают на то, что новым президентом станет Хиллари Клинтон, которая занимает более агрессивную позицию, как по отношению к России, так и по отношению к разрешению сирийского кризиса. Они уже настраиваются на новые политические течения, на новую позицию, которая будет использована новой администрацией после ухода Барака Обамы в начале 2017 года. 
Напомним, ранее кандидат в президенты США от Республиканской партии Дональд Трамп заявил, что план Хиллари Клинтон по урегулированию ситуации в Сирии приведет к Третьей мировой войне. Как сообщает Reuters, Трамп подверг критике план своей соперницы, предполагающий создание бесполетной зоны и зоны безопасности на земле для защиты гражданского населения в Сирии. По мнению политика, это может привести к конфликту с вооруженными силами России, обладающей ядерным оружием. 
Как заявил республиканец, для него более принципиальной является победа над ИГ, а не уход со своего поста президента Сирии Башара Асада. ""Не стоит фокусироваться на Сирии, надо фокусироваться на ИГ"", — сказал Трамп.

"""В ""гиперзвуке"" Россия на передовых позициях, у США такого пока нет""","Фото: mil.ru 
О разработке гиперзвукового оружия в России подробнее рассказал Pravda.Ru главный редактор журнала ""Экспорт вооружений"" Андрей Фролов. 
— Испытание прошло успешно — но в первый раз. Насколько мы конкурентоспособны в разработке гиперзвуковых аппаратов с США? 
— Мы занимаем передовые позиции. И это не самое первое испытание, по крайней мере, о нечто подобном сообщалось ранее. Думаю, что уже в ближайшем будущем эти системы будут стоять на вооружении. Пока, скажем, у американцев такого нет. Китайцы также занимаются разработкой. 
— Не могли бы приоткрыть подробности? 
— Эта тема секретная. Сложно какие-то подробности приоткрывать. Уже хорошо, что сам факт озвучен, что такое есть. Судя по всему, испытания прошли успешно, но, видимо, еще необходимо провести их цикл. И самое главное, разработать ракеты для него. Видимо, это будет новая система ""Сармат"". 
Напомним, ""изделие 4202"" предназначается для установки на перспективные межконтинентальные баллистические ракеты, вместо традиционных боеголовок. Все бортовое оборудование, электронные комплексы, а также система управления аппарата полностью состоят из российских комплектующих. 
Как ранее сообщала Pravda.Ru, гиперзвуковое оружие к 2020 году должно поступить на вооружение российской армии. Технологии разработки гиперзвуковых носителей как ядерного, так и обычного оружия есть не только у России, но и у США и Китая. Еще 9 января 2015 года Китай испытал гиперзвуковой планер WU-14, запускаемый в космос при помощи межконтинентальной баллистической ракеты. 
Российские же ученые работают над ракетами разных типов с гиперзвуковыми прямоточными воздушно-реактивными двигателями (ГПВРД), которые можно будет запускать с земли, с кораблей или с боевых самолетов.

Ученые подготовили к производству 100-процентный мужской контрацептив,"1 комментариев 0 поделились Фото: Fotodom.ru/DP 
В основе разработанного препарата - прогестерон длительного действия, гормон, который при введении в организм мужчины, воздействует на функции гипофиза в мозгу, снижая выработку сперматозоидов. 
Испытания препарата проводились в течение года. Испытуемые получали инъекции каждые два месяца. Всего за 24 недели количество сперматозоидов сократилось до одного миллиона на миллилитр и даже меньше. 96% пар, принимавших участие в тестировании препарата, не столкнулись с нежелательной беременностью, и лишь у четырех партнерш было зафиксировано зачатие. 
После завершения испытаний, почти три четверти добровольцев, принимавших участие в эксперименте, заявили о своем желании продолжить прием препарата. И это понятно: как подчеркивают ученые, на фармацевтическом рынке сегодня ощущается острая нехватка контрацептивов для мужчин, в то время как женские контрацептивы представлены в широком ассортименте. 
Однако не все так радужно: препарат имеет побочные эффекты. Среди них - депрессия, общее ухудшение настроения, мышечные боли, высыпания на лице. Дело даже дошло до судебного разбирательства. 
Но есть и эффект, который можно назвать положительным, ведь препарат повышает мужское либидо. 
Так что, на прилавки аптек этот препарат попадет еще не скоро. Как говорят ученые, из-за побочных эффектов рано говорить о коммерческой перспективе препарата. 
Как же решается вопрос контрацепции в России? 
По словам акушера-гинеколога , кандидата медицинских наук Бориса Лордкипанидзе, более 50 процентов населения в РФ использует технику прерванного полового акта . Она абсолютно ненадежна. Но на нее полагаются больше, чем на то, чтобы один раз обратиться к врачу, обсудить наиболее подходящий метод контрацепции и воспользоваться рекомендациями, будь то внутриматочная спираль, будь то оральная контрацепция, или инъекционная контрацепция, которая является пролонгированной. 
""Можно делать раз в три месяца один укол и последующие три месяца жить совершенно спокойно, не беспокоясь о беременности. Можно использовать внутриматочную спираль, которая устанавливается на пять лет, и просто периодически наблюдаться у гинеколога. Установка спирали является бесплатной. Все, что нужно от пациентки, - это чтобы она купила эту спираль и обратилась в женскую консультацию, где ей эту спираль установят бесплатно. 
Но, к сожалению, у нас полагаются на русское ""авось"": ""Меня пронесет, ничего страшного"". Потом, конечно же, эти люди идут к врачу с целью прервать беременность. Таков у нас основной источник абортов"", - отметил врач в комментарии Pravda.Ru.

Дело к войне: Церкви ищут общий язык,"0 комментариев 7 поделились Фото: Архив Pravda.Ru 
Ранее РПЦ выступала за ограничение контактов с этой Церковью из-за ее либерального отношения к однополым бракам и священникам нетрадиционной ориентации. Почему отношение изменилось? Это была политическая миссия? О чем патриарх говорил с королевой? Нет ли в таких контактах размывания православных ценностей? Об этом в прямом эфире видеостудии Pravda. R u рассказал обозреватель агентства ""Регнум"" Станислав Стремидловский. 
— Этот визит был предпринят после того, как президенту Путину отказали в участии в мероприятиях по открытию Русского духовно-культурного центра во Франции. Почему государственное участие в духовно-культурных мероприятиях блокируется на Западе, а патриарх принимается там с распростертыми объятиями? 
— Я бы не стал связывать эти две вещи. Тем более, что нашему президенту не отказали. Он не поехал сам по одной простой причине — потому что господин Олланд хотел обсуждать вопросы по Сирии, связанные с Алеппо, где французы очень серьезно завязли. А собственно, что мы могли сказать? Те предложения французов, которые выдвигались, нам не интересны. 
Визит патриарха — это совершенно отдельная история. Повод очень хороший — 300 лет отношений российского православия с англиканством было отмечено на очень высоком уровне. 
Нашего патриарха принял не только архиепископ Кентерберийский Джастин Уэлби, который является чем-то вроде управляющего главы англиканских церквей. Его приняла и глава англикан — британская королева Елизавета II. 
Несмотря на различные окрики британской прессы и некоторых депутатов британского парламента, которые шумели, что патриарха Кирилла нельзя принимать или надо его визит сместить на более низшую ступень, ее величество встретилась с ним. Были и другие встречи, в том числе с представителями католической церкви, что тоже, на мой взгляд, очень важно. 
— Конечно, этот визит был в плане церковного общения. Почему Запад старается так активно изолировать Россию политически? Или все-таки визит патриарха имел и политическое значение? 
— Я не согласен, что Россия на Западе изолирована. Как в свое время говорил один из английских лордов, ""никто не пинает только дохлую собаку"". А Россия сегодня приобрела гипертрофированное, увеличенное значение в американской избирательной кампании. Опять же еще один интересный момент последнего времени — избрание нового генерального секретаря ООН. Антониу Гутерриш — католик и социалист. Избрание этого человека приветствовала католическая церковь. 
А представлял его наш Виталий Чуркин, именно ему доверили это сделать. Это тоже, в общем-то, знак и показатель роли и места России в мире. И то, что сейчас делает патриарх Кирилл, конечно, некое возвращение к советскому времени, когда Церковь была очень активна во внешнем мире. В какой-то степени патриарх Кирилл сейчас повторяет традицию. Кстати, ее в 1962 году основал патриарх Алексей I, который тоже тогда встречался с руководством англиканской церкви. 
Естественно, в первую очередь говорили о церковных вопросах, но все равно здесь никак нельзя обойтись без политики. В феврале этого года произошло небывалое доселе историческое событие — встреча патриарха Кирилла с Папой Римским Франциском . Тогда, на мой взгляд, главы двух Церквей создали новый формат общения в совершенно небывалых доселе условиях преследования Церкви в мире, в большей степени на Западе. 
Мы не стремимся прямо сразу сесть за евхаристический стол и разделить чашу Христову. Мы говорим о том, что сейчас перед нами появился более опасный враг, более страшный. Мы сталкиваемся с выходом на сцену уже напрямую врага рода человеческого, который обозначил себя, показал свои рога и копыта и уже грозит миру и Церкви людоедским уничтожением. 
Мы были свидетелями демонстрации WikiLeaks писем избирательного штаба госпожи Клинтон, где говорится о чуть ли не перевороте католической церкви в США, о желании создать там свою арабскую весну на католический манер. Раньше католическая церковь США старалась быть нейтральной в схватке между Трампом и Хилари, считая их обоих неприемлемым, но сейчас все-таки настроения изменились. И не только католики, но и евангелисты, протестанты уже говорят о том, что надо выбирать из двух зол. 
Бывший спикер палаты представителей Ньют Гингрич в интервью католическому порталу National Catholic Register сказал, что сейчас США стоят перед глобальным разворотом, который определит их судьбу на ближайшие 50-100 лет, перед аналогом светской секулярной Французской революции, перед наступлением секулярного тоталитаризма, который попросту может уничтожить ту христианскую Америку, которую мы знаем. 
— Чем все-таки важен визит нашего п атриарха в Англию? 
— В англиканской церкви есть здоровые силы, и перед лицом наступления врага рода человеческого все же нужно искать союзников, а не пытаться находить разделения друг от друга. Британская христианская пресса писала, что визит патриарха Кирилла важен, потому что нужно строить мосты. Это любимая фраза Папы Франциска, который постоянно подчеркивает, что его задача в этом мире — возводить мосты и разрушать стены.

Глава ВАК призвал умерить пыл вокруг диссертации Мединского,"5 комментариев 5 поделились 
Напомним, газета ""Коммерсантъ"" сообщала, что известные российские академики, члены ""Клуба 1 июля"", присоединились к требованию участника сообщества ""Диссернет"" Ивана Бабицкого лишить ученой степени Владимира Мединского . Ученые возмущены тем, что в качестве главного методического принципа своей диссертации министр объявил ""соответствие интересам России"". По словам академиков, Мединский пытался ""заменить истину мифами"", что ""подрывает основы научного взгляда на мир"". 
Ранее ВАК приняла решение отозвать дело о лишении степени из диссертационного совета Уральского федерального университета. ""Вопросы лишения ученых степеней и рассмотрение этого вопроса жестко регламентированы соответствующими нормативными актами. Поэтому здесь надо действовать очень четко, в соответствии именно с этими положениями. Потому что любое нарушение этих действующих положений повлечет автоматическую отмену через суд этого решения, если обратится любая из сторон: или тот, на которого заявляют, или заявители, которые заявляют"", — сказал Владимир Филиппов РИА Новости. 
Глава ВАК подчеркнул, что и Минобрнауки РФ, и руководство аттестационной комиссии действовало в полном соответствии с нормативной базой. 
""Если есть заявление человека, чье аттестационное дело рассматривается в совете, о том, чтобы перенести заседание диссовета, и он, возможно, планирует свое участие, то мы обязаны это сделать. И если будет проведено заседание диссовета при наличии его заявления, то это будет нарушением, и любое решение диссовета в таком случае будет отменено. Диссоветы должны рассматривать поступившие к ним на рассмотрение дела в течение двух месяцев, по истечении двух месяцев уже Минобрнауки должно принимать соответствующее решение, в частности по отзыву диссертации из диссовета"", — сказал Филиппов. 
По его словам, если будет проведено рассмотрение диссертации за пределами двухмесячного срока, любая из сторон может оспорить решение диссовета. В соответствии с нормативной базой, любое решение диссовета может быть отменено. 
Владимир Филиппов отметил, что решение о назначении нового диссертационного совета по этому делу, скорее всего, будет принято 25 ноября на президиуме ВАК. 
Напомним, в апреле участник сообщества ""Диссернет"" Иван Бабицкий подал в Минобрнауки заявление с просьбой лишить Мединского степени, поскольку, по его словам, диссертация ""Проблемы объективности в освещении российской истории второй половины XV — XVII веков"", абсурдна и не имеет научной ценности. 
Владимир Мединский защитил диссертацию в 2011 году в Российском государственном социальном университете, однако позже диссертационный совет РГСУ был распущен, и вопрос о сохранности ученой степени был перенесен в стены Уральского федерального университета. Заседание диссертационного совета УрФУ отменили, так как Мединский на нем не присутствовал. После было объявлено об отзыве дела из диссертационного совета из-за истечения двухмесячного срока рассмотрения. 
Ранее пресс-секретарь Мединского Ирина Казначеева отметила, что под обращением в основном подписались ""физики и математики, которые никогда не скрывали негативного отношения ко всему, что делает власть"". По ее словам, авторы письма пытаются доказать, что лишить ученой степени можно любого человека, который не разделяет каких-либо либо научных или политических взглядов.

Как заставить себя заниматься спортом? Ответ найден,"0 комментариев 0 поделились 
По их мнению, с одной стороны, атмосфера благожелательности в спортивных учреждениях часто работает сама против себя, так как она привлекает внимание всех людей к тем посетителям спортзалов, которые наименее всего активны. Это порождает негативную спираль, заставляющую их посещать их еще меньше. 
В то же время, наиболее активные люди задают в спортзале некий тон, который стимулирует других активнее заниматься спортом, так как люди начинают ожидать от себя большего, уверен Дамон Сентола из университета Пенсильвании (США). 
В такому выводу Сентола и его коллеги пришли во время наблюдения за группой из почти восьми сотен студентов университета, которым они предложили бесплатно посещать тренажерный зал на протяжении 11 недель в рамках одной из государственных программ, не связанных, на первый взгляд, с психологическими исследованиями. 
Студенты даже и не знали, что принимают участие в проекте, в ходе которого ученые хотели выяснить их мотивацию при посещении спортзалов и фитнесклубов. Для этого ученые создали несколько разных сайтов, которые фактически предлагали учащимся поучаствовать в одной и той же программе, но пытались завлечь их разными способами. 
Помимо рекламы, на некоторых версиях этих порталов так же выводилась негативная или позитивная статистика посещений, в том числе различные ""рекорды"" посетителей и советы тем, кто мало посещал спортзал. В некоторых из них эти рекорды выводились исключительно в индивидуальном порядке, отражая статистику только самого посетителя курсов, а в других - видеть данные по успехам других ""команд"" и отдельных студентов. 
Кроме различных соревновательных мер, ученые так же проверили, как работают типичные приемы, которые сегодня применяются в американских вузах и школах для стимулирования учащихся - группы доверия, участники в которых могут побуждать друг друга к занятиям спорта, и ""подцепление"" особо активных спортсменов к командам ""прогульщиков"". 
Таким образом ученые еще раз подтвердили известную английскую поговорку: ""Хочешь сделать что-то популярным, преврати это в спорт"": те пользователи, которые посещали ""соревновательные""версии сайта, почти в два раза чаще в среднем ходили на занятия и гораздо активнее занимались фитнесом и зарядкой, чем те студенты, которых ученые поместили в ""группы доверия"". Причем этот эффект проявлялся как в групповых, так и в индивидуальных версиях сайтов, из чего ученые сделали вывод: важнее соревнование, а не его характер. 
На основании своих выводов ученые посоветовали всем владельцам спортзалов и спортивным преподавателям в университетах стимулировать соперничество между посетителями, разбивая их на команды и заставляя их бороться за некое звание или символический приз. 
Соревновательность в спорте, как добавляют ученые, имеет и другие плюсы - она заставляет людей отказываться от табака, алкоголя, вредной еды и прочих негативных вещей, мешающих им достичь максимума в борьбе с конкурентами. Поэтому подобные меры будут не только повышать популярность спортзалов, но и помогать людям улучшать свое здоровье, заключают ученые. 
Как известно, многие люди приходят в спортзалы с целью похудеть. Как же им помогают в этом фитнес-трекеры ? Это попытались выяснить ученые из Питтсбургского университета. Для этого они провели исследование, в котором приняли участие 470 добровольцев, имеющих избыточный вес, в возрасте от 18 до 35 лет. При этом испытуемые уже вели борьбу с лишними килограммами не менее двух лет. 
Испытуемых разделили на две группы, в одной добровольцы использовали фитнес-гаджеты, которые подсчитывали калории, физическую активность и число сердечных сокращений, а в другой - нет. Оказалось, что в группе, где добровольцы не применяли трекеры, эффект от занятия был почти в два раза более эффективным.

В заявлении ""Роскосмоса"", которое приводит издание, говорится, что российская компания не будет работать бесплатно. ""Нет денег — нет товара"", — цитирует Les Echos сообщение госкорпорации. 
Напомним, речь идет о 300 миллионах евро, которые Arianespace должна была выплатить ""Роскосмосу"". Но эти средства были заморожены Арбитражным судом в Гааге по делу бывших акционеров ЮКОСа. 
Ранее ""Роскосмос"" выиграл суд во Франции по делу об аресте счетов госкорпорации в рамках дела ЮКОСа . ""Они признали, что наши доводы правильные и не надо арестовывать наши счета. Это не конец наверняка… Но мы свои интересы отстаивали и будем отстаивать"", — заявил директор по коммуникациям ""Роскосмоса"" Игорь Буренков. 
11 апреля во Франции были арестованы $700 млн ""Роскосмоса"" и ""Космической связи"" в связи с судебным решением по делу ЮКОСа. 
Ранее Pravda.Ru писала, что для своих астронавтов в 2019 году NASA подумывает приобрести места на пилотируемом корабле ""Союз"", ведь компании Boeing и SpaceX не успевают подготовить свои корабли к сроку. 
Американские коммерческие компании Boeing и SpaceX занимаются разработкой своих пилотируемых кораблей — Starliner и Dragon. Сроки сдачи проектов уже поджимают, поэтому Хьюстон решил рассмотреть возможность покупки дополнительных мест на ""Союзе"". NASA надеется, что хотя бы одно из частных космических судов будет способно выполнять оперативные задания к концу 2017 или началу 2018 годов. Однако Boeing уже сдвинул даты предположительной готовности своего аппарата на начало 2018 года. SpaceX все еще планирует запуск в конце 2017 года. Но и здесь задержки неизбежны, особенно принимая во внимание недавний несчастный случай — взрыв ракеты Falcon 9. Поэтому, в тайне NASA обеспокоено дополнительными задержками, из-за которых планы запуска своих пилотируемых кораблей будут отложены до 2019 года. 
По данным Ars Technica, решение купить места на ""Союзе"" в NASA примут не раньше декабря, конгресс вряд ли будет готов оплатить места в российском корабле, ведь цены неуклонно растут. Сейчас одно из необходимых шести мест на ""Союзе"" обходится США почти в 82 миллиона долларов. К 2019 году стоимость еще увеличится.

Российское посольство в Дамаске снова подверглось минометному обстрелу,"Фото: AP 
Как говорится в сообщении, размещенном на сайте российского внешнеполитического ведомства, в Москве ждут международной реакции на случившееся. 
По комплексу посольства России в Сирии террористами было выпущено два снаряда. Одна из мин разорвалась недалеко от главного входа в офисное здание посольства, вторая сдетонировала за внешней оградой дипмиссии. ""По счастливой случайности обошлось без жертв. Российскому загранучреждению нанесен материальный ущерб, в том числе повреждены четыре автомобиля"", - отмечается на сайте МИД России. 
В Москве решительно осудили «очередную террористическую атаку против российского дипломатического представительства», говорится в сообщении. Ведомство также отмечает, что реакция международного сообщества станет лакмусовой бумажкой и покажет, кто из партнеров выгораживает террористов, потакая им и наводя на «удобные» цели. 
Напомним, российское посольство в Дамаске не в первый раз становится объектом атаки террористов . 3 октября по зданию дипмиссии было выпущено три снаряда, один из которых разорвался недалеко от жилого комплекса дипломатов. Обстрел велся из пригорода сирийской столицы Джобар, который контролируют боевики из группировок ""Джабхат Фатх аш-Шам"" и ""Файлак ар-Рахман"", запрещенных в России. 
Следующий аналогичный инцидент произошел 13 октября . ""Одна из мин взорвалась в непосредственной близости от поста внешней охраны дипмиссии, еще одна - недалеко от входа в консульский отдел, два минометных снаряда сдетонировали в сотне метров от ограждения посольства"", - сообщал МИД России. 
Рассуждая о волне истерии по поводу участия России в сирийской войне, о двойных стандартах, когда нашу страну обвиняют в том, что считается совершенно нормальным для вояк из стран НАТО, мало отмечать, что ""плакальщики"" не жалели боеприпасов в Ливии, в Ираке, в Афганистане и продолжают делать это каждый день. Мы должны попытаться понять, в чем причина этой истерической волны. Башар Асад с самого начала ставил целью участия в войне для Сирийской арабской армии и ее союзников из народного ополчения и из других государств, включая российские воздушно-космические силы, достижение мира. Целью боевых действий было создание военных и политических условий для национального примирения, начала политического процесса, национального диалога, создание, вероятно, новой конституции, нового избирательного законодательства, выборы, продолжение тех реформ, которые он начал. Его противники определяли свою цель совершенно иначе : свержение Башара Асада любой ценой. Занятно, что они (если исключать совсем крайние формы вроде запрещенной в России ИГИЛ), как правило, выступали против политических и экономических реформ. Они хотели, чтобы все в стране было, как раньше, только с ними самими на руководящих должностях.

Стала известна возможная причина взрыва дома в Рязани,"Фото: © Пресс-служба МЧС по Рязанской области 
Об этом сообщила официальный представитель регионального управления СК РФ Анжелика Евдокимова, передают РИА Новости. 
""На месте происшествия обнаружены и изъяты фрагменты газового оборудования, которые находились в квартире, являющейся эпицентром взрыва. Результаты осмотра фрагментов газового оборудования показали, что была отвернута гайка на выходе газового счетчика"", - сказала собеседница агентства. 
Евдокимова отметила, что это, по версии следствия, может быть предварительной причиной взрыва. 
Следствием назначены взрыво-техническая, судебно-медицинские, строительно-технические судебные экспертизы, устанавливаются обстоятельства произошедшего и виновники ЧП. По информации СК, осмотр места происшествия и фрагментов газового оборудования предварительно подтвердил версию следствия о том, что ЧП произошло ""в результате действий лица, проживающего в квартире, где произошел взрыв газа"". 
Напомним, как сообщала Правда.Ру, ранним утром воскресенья, 23 октября на верхних этажах 10-этажного дома в 1-м Осеннем переулке произошел взрыв , в результате которого были разрушены семь квартир, а перекрытия между двумя верхними этажами повреждены. 
Как сообщали в региональном управлении МЧС, Всего для ликвидации последствий происшествия было задействовано 279 человек и 61 единица техники, из них от МЧС России - 162 человека и 31 единица техники. В целях авиаразведки применялся беспилотный летательный аппарат. 
Было проведено обследование здания аппаратно-программным диагностическим комплексом «Стрела-П», предназначенным для оперативной оценки технического состояния зданий и сооружений, опасности их обрушения и возможного риска для людей, находящихся внутри и поблизости объектов. Использование ""Струны"" позволяет ускоренно обрабатывать данные, получаемые при динамических испытаниях на устойчивость зданий и сооружений. 
Следственные органы возбудили уголовное дело по статье ""производство, хранение, перевозка либо сбыт товаров и продукции, выполнение работ или оказание услуг, не отвечающих требованиям безопасности, повлекшие по неосторожности смерть двух или более лиц"". Наказание, предусмотренное этой статьей - до десяти лет лишения свободы.

В наступлении на Мосул иракская армия взяла передышку,"0 комментариев 0 поделились Фото: AP 
""Они сделали паузу в наступлении и проводят передислокацию, переукомплектование и зачистку позиций в тылу. Мы считаем, что это займет лишь пару дней, а после этого мы продолжим наступление в направлении Мосула. Это их план действий, и мы полагаем, что они будут его придерживаться"", - заявил Дорриан. 
Массированное наступление на Мосулведется с 17 октября иракскими военными и силами полиции, а также курдскими формированиями при поддержке авиации коалиции во главе с США. 
Напомним, как сообщала Правда.Ру, президент Иракского Курдистана Масуд Барзани заявил, что при сохранении нынешних темпов наступления на Мосул на освобождение от боевиков ИГ (запрещена в РФ) может уйти три месяца. 
""Мы смогли быстро отвоевать приступы к городу, неизвестно, насколько сильно ИГ будет обороняться в самом городе. Но мы видим, что у них есть сотни смертников, должно быть, там целые фабрики по производству взрывчатки. При штурме это создаст большую опасность. Если все и дальше пойдет хорошо, я рассчитываю, что город удастся освободить самое позднее через три месяца"", - сказал Барзани в интервью таблоиду Bild . 
Напомним, 17 октября премьер-министр Ирака Хайдер аль-Абади заявил о начале военной операции по освобождению Мосула от боевиков ИГ. США и их союзники с 2014 года проводят в Ираке и Сирии операцию против ИГ. Иракские военные и силы полиции, а также курдские формирования при поддержке авиации коалиции во главе с США начали массированное наступление на город. 
Однако это наступление может обернуться катастрофой на Ближнем Востоке. Об этом заявил, к примеру, кандидат в президенты США Дональд Трамп. Или вот мнение отставного полковника США Дэниэла Дэвиса, которое он изложил в статье, опубликованной в The National Interest : Америке и силам коалиции стоит поторопиться с проведением операции в Мосуле, в противном случае террористы могут разорвать этот альянс Чем дольше продержится ИГ и чем больший урон нанесет коалиции, тем более вероятно, что религиозные и политические различия между освободительными силами будут проявляться все сильнее"", - пишет Дэвис. 
Прокомментировать ситуацию Pravda.Ru попросила военного эксперта Бориса Подопригору. 
В последние несколько месяцев официального пребывания американского президента в Белом доме, им захотелось организовать такой политический спектакль на тему американской приверженности в борьбе с терроризмом. Я так это вижу. 
Что из этого получится, мне сказать сложно. Самое плохое, что я ожидаю, это новое столкновение по линии сунниты-шииты. Вот в чем самая большая проблема.

Эксперт: Хэллоуин запретить невозможно,"0 комментариев 1 поделились Фото: AP 
""По мнению РПЦ, моему мнению, а также мнению ряда общественных организаций, празднование Хэллоуина в России нарушает действующее российское законодательство. Хэллоуин — праздник, отвергающийся и осуждающийся религией. По сути, Хэллоуин - это противопоставление святым и религии. Ритуал вхождения в образ нечисти через костюмы и грим, ритуал выпрашивания сладостей (подкормки нечисти), ритуал ночных танцев — по сути, беснование"", — сказал Ярослав Михайлов. 
Адвокат уверен, что повсеместное празднование кануна Дня всех святых в общественных местах грубо нарушает действующее законодательство России, а потому должно быть запрещено. 
Он подчеркнул, что Хэллоуин — это языческое (религиозное) течение, которое осуществляется на территории России. А значит, его празднование попадает под действие положений ст. 24.2 ""Порядок осуществления миссионерской деятельности"" ФЗ №125-ФЗ 1997 года. 
Он добавил, что в России должны существовать религиозные объединения, отвечающие за проведение этого праздника, а также специально отведенные места для совершения хэллоуинских обрядов. 
Прокомментировать ситуацию Pravda.Ru попросила юриста, судебного эксперта-религиоведа, члена экспертного совета по проведению государственной религиоведческой экспертизы при министерстве юстиции России, действующего эксперта в области нетрадиционных религиозных движений и сект Игоря Иванишко. 
— Есть какие-то юридические основания для запрета Хэллоуина? 
— Этот праздник в России не является официальным. Он не внесен у нас как нерабочий день в Трудовой кодекс. Он не имеет никакого статуса. Поэтому что-либо запретить, если не установлен статус какого-то мероприятия, невозможно. 
А прогнозировать можно, что у Генеральной прокуратуры будет примерно такой ответ: что если некий праздник Хэллоуин был использован конкретной религиозной организацией для вербовочно-миссионерской деятельности и если факт будет доказан, то виновные в этом конкретном случае будут привлечены к ответственности. 
Но запретить в целом данное мероприятие на территории России, чтобы какие-то общественные организации проводили на улицах маскарады, — это невозможно. 
Если вы спрашиваете о моем мнении, то я тоже считаю, что для России, для нашей истории, культуры, в целом, для народов, которые проживают на территории нашей страны, этот праздник не является аутентичным, не является естественным. 
То есть, это такое западное веяние, и то, что под маской Хэллоуина действительно с 31 октября на 1 ноября проводят различные религиозные группы, в том числе радикальные и сатанистские, какие-то свои мероприятия, это не есть хорошо. Поэтому я бы относился к этому празднику крайне осторожно. Но, с точки зрения закона, запретить его на территории РФ невозможно.

Bloodshed predicted in US after elections,"Bloodshed predicted in US after elections 26.10.2016 Preliminary analysis of results of the US presidential elections shows that the chances of America's remaining calm after 8 November make up only 5%. Most probably, the hottest events will take place on the elections day. According to the first scenario, there are three options of the development. The first one is that Trump wins, however the Democrats will steal votes to claim victory. In case it happens, mass protests, violence, bloodshed and a lot of problems connected with the law may be expected, the Natural News wrote. The second one is that Obama declares results invalid, asserting that the Russians have influenced the voting, which is the most probable outcome of the elections and it will definitely generate unrest. The third one is that the Democrats recognize Trump's victory and agree upon peaceful change of power. However, even in case Obama and Clintons admit their defeat and agree that Donald Trump is the next president, mass riots may spark everywhere. It is noted that Obama can make use of it to declare the martial law and suspend Trump's coming into power, accusing him of all the sins. It is also possible that Clinton wins the elections, but her adversaries will dispute validity of the results. This scenario is quite problematic, as it may face violence which will promptly turn into a military coup or revolt of the armed citizens, a march to Washington and dethronement of the corrupt power regime.

Germans want to breathe Russian natural gas without Ukraine,"Germans want to breathe Russian natural gas without Ukraine 26.10.2016 The current goal of the German establishment is to please the Americans and keep business with the Russians afloat at the same time. The Germans now try to present the Nord Stream-2 gas pipeline as a purely commercial project. The pipeline will be built, despite the anti-Russian hysteria in Poland, Latvia and Ukraine. The economic war with Russia In July 2016, spokesman for the President of Poland Andrzej Duda told the Financial Times (FT), that Duda and Obama were opposed to the construction of the Nord Stream-2. For the US, it goes about the formation of unwanted relations between Russia and the EU, particularly between Russia and Germany. The Americans also hope to push Europe to the construction of LNG terminals (liquefied natural gas) of the American production, of course. Print version Font Size The Americans want to convince Brussels that you the EU must not let Russia build the pipeline system bypassing Ukraine. Such a move would deprive the pro-American Kiev of two billion dollars in annual revenues. On the other hand, several countries of Eastern and Central Europe will remain dependent on Russian supplies for another 30-50 years, even against the backdrop of the ""economic warfare."" Therefore, US officials suggest the EU should start forming an alternative gas transport structure. German companies, for instance, could buy natural gas from Norway, and Italian companies could acquire LNG from Spain. Yet, the Norwegian natural gas will be expensive and even more expensive, whereas Spain will never be able to meet common European demands. Poland says a big, big no to the project on all possible fronts, acting in information, legal and financial fields. Another agent of Washington's influence, Latvian President Raimonds Vejonis said after meeting with his Estonian counterpart in Riga that North Stream-2 did not correspond to common European objectives and energy principles of the European Union. This project is more a geopolitical, rather than an economic one, said Vejonis. Ukraine is very much opposed to the project too, of course. In January, Naftogaz of Ukraine filed a complaint at the European Energy Community, which was then sent to the European Commission. According to Ukraine, the EU may violate its own legislation if the Nord Stream-2 materialises. It goes about the Third Energy Package, which says that the gas producer can not be the owner of the pipeline. All goes well in Germany Germany is quite perplexed as well. Manfred Weber, the leader of the conservative European People's Party in the European Parliament, told Der Spiegel that the possibility to introduce new sanctions against Russia and its leadership must remain on the table. In addition, the Nord Stream-2 will not be built if President Putin does not stop dropping bombs on civilians. German Minister for Foreign Affairs Frank-Walter Steinmeier does not hear such calls. On Sunday, he told ARD that new sanctions against Russia would be counterproductive. ""What works in Ukraine, does not have to be a right solution in Syria. We need Russia to achieve peace in Syria,"" the minister said. Steinmeier understands that new sanctions would certainly halt the North Stream-2. The Germans say now on a federal level that this pipeline is purely a commercial project without any geopolitical innuendos, so it is not subject to the sanctions pressure. The pipeline will reduce the price for German consumers by 20 percent, so Germany's concerns are easy to understand. ""Due to the extension of the Nord Stream system, we will provide reliable gas supplies for Germany and the EU for a long period of time. This project will strengthen more than 40 years of our successful cooperation with Gazprom,"" the official website of the Nord Stream-2 says, quoting Klaus Schaefer, BASF CEO. The Germans pretended not to have noticed Poland's failure to register a joint venture of international consortia. A failure to register the project within the scope of the EU means that each applicant will have to independently look for opportunities to contribute to the project. Noteworthy, Gazprom owns a stake of 51 percent stake in the project, while E.ON, Shell, OMV and BASF/Wintershall - ten percent each, and Engie - nine. Director of Nord Stream-2 Public Relations Ulrich Lissek remains positive and sees no technical difficulties. The work on the project goes according to plan, and the system is expected to be launched in late 2019. It is in 2019 when Russia is expected to withdraw from the Ukrainian gas transit system. The capacity of two sections of the Nord Stream will make up about 120 billion cubic meters of gas per year, plus the Turkish Stream - 31.5 billion. This will be enough to replace the capacity of the Ukrainian pipeline, which now supplies about 60 billion cubic meters per year. By 2019, Ukraine will remain only an option for import routes, and Europe understands it. Lyuba Lulko Read article on the Russian version of Pravda.Ru Europe sells Ukraine for gas",1
"Sudan, Africa and the Mosaic of Horrors","Sudan, Africa and the Mosaic of Horrors 27.10.2016 ""What could be the most striking image, one that would clearly illustrate the destructive involvement of the United States in Sudan?"" I ask. ""In short, what should I photograph, that could show the suffering of the Sudanese people?"" ""Let's go and photograph what is left of the Al-Shifa factory,"" I am told. ""It is terrible, and truly symbolic."" It is actually close to impossible to photograph just about anything in Sudan. For right or wrong reasons, the government is paranoid. Elaborate permits have to be issued for traveling outside the main urban areas, and for taking photos and videos even inside the capital city of Khartoum itself. If one dares to at all, one has to work fast and clandestinely, even if one is not planning to do anything damaging to Sudan. by ANDRE VLTCHEK Print version Font Size Why was I here? After making my films, after covering the horrid wars of the African Great Lakes, after witnessing the awful devastation of the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), I had to finally come to Sudan, which for me represented that remaining, that last piece of the 'puzzle'; a part in the mosaic of the horrors which are now covering almost the entire continent of Africa. I thought that I had to be here, in order to understand all the subtle nuances of how Western imperialist designs have been fragmenting and ruining this entire continent. I convinced one of my friends in Khartoum to accompany me, and on my third day in Sudan, we drove towards the 'legendary' sight of the former Al-Shifa pharmaceutical factory in Bahri, Khartoum North. The path we took led through relatively affluent neighborhoods, full of large houses, even villas, some of which, I was told, belong to Omar al-Bashir himself, and to his relatives. Our car passed near the bizarre complex of Al-Noor Mosque, which is built in a Turkish style. ""This may be the only mosque in the world, which has a supermarket behind its walls,"" my guide explained, smiling sarcastically. ""The investment and idea came from our President; from al-Bashir himself."" A few minutes later we see what we came here for: the site, the rubble, the devastation . A surviving chimney of the factory is right in front of us. On the left-hand side of the road, it is just pure destruction. 18 years after the 'event', nothing grows here, and nothing, no structures have replaced what has been converted into debris. I work fast. I don't want to get caught. I came here in order to document the brutality of the Western global regime, but somehow here I feel like a thief, like an intruder. At this point I still don't know why. US missile destroyed factory: Clinton The Al-Shifa factory was hit and destroyed by US Tomahawk cruise missiles in 1998, just a few days after the terrorist attacks on the American embassies in both Kenya and Tanzania. President Bill Clinton ordered the attack, arguing that the compound was storing nerve gas, something that was strongly denied by both the Sudanese government and the owner of the plant. On October 20 th , 2005, The New York Times reported in its uncommonly critical article: "" American officials have acknowledged over the years that the evidence that prompted President Clinton to order the missile strike on the Shifa plant was not as solid as first portrayed. Indeed, officials later said that there was no proof that the plant had been manufacturing or storing nerve gas, as initially suspected by the Americans, or had been linked to Osama bin Laden, who was a resident of Khartoum in the 1980's... no apology has been made and no restitution offered, which has Sudan's government steaming, even seven years after the ground shook and the dark sky over Khartoum turned light as the plant was hit. On the most recent anniversary of the bombing, Sudanese authorities did what they always do and repeated their call for a United Nations investigation of the American attack on the factory, which, if nothing else, was a major provider of medicines for humans and animals at the time it was destroyed. Mustafa Osman Ismail, who was foreign minister until recently, also raised the issue at the United Nations summit meeting in New York last month, saying the bombing ""damaged the development efforts of my country and deprived my people of basic medicines."""" ""It is thoroughly paradoxical,"" I am told, as we are driving away. ""The Americans ruined Sudan's most important medicine supply. They bombed a private factory that actually belonged to a person with extremely close business ties to the United States."" But this is not the only paradox that I will encounter in this country. And it is not the only paradox in its relationship with the arch tormentor - the United States. *** In Khartoum, I met dozens of people: Sudanese people, Eritrean people, Europeans as well as Asians. I kept putting the same questions to everyone: is Sudan really at odds with the West, particularly with the United States? Or is 'the game' actually much more complex than that? Western media again distorts the truth If Sudan is really a brutal dictatorship, then Sudanese people are shockingly outspoken. Those who are opposing the government are speaking against it openly, even in front of a total stranger like myself. This would be unthinkable even in today's Egypt or Turkey. ""But no names, please, no names,"" I am told. I understand. I take notes, but do not write down any names. A man working for an international organization is laughing, as we are having dinner: ""In Sudan, people can meet and say whatever they want. Nobody cares. But god forbid if they begin to organize."" He is talkative and friendly. But later I find out that he thinks (and tells his colleagues) that I am a 'spy', which, in turn, is explained to me, is quite the usual way of looking at each other here. It is enough to be half Eritrean or Ethiopian to be suspected of spying. All Westerners are flatly considered to be professional spies, no matter how strong their anti-imperialist credentials are. This constant suspicion is what made me uncomfortable in Sudan, from the first moment I stepped off the plane. I never felt like this in Eritrea or in Zimbabwe. There, they knew who I was and what I do: they read my books and have watched my films, and consequently they trusted me. Here, one paradox piles on top of another. There is this brutal embargo, and open confrontation between the West and Sudan. Already, many years ago, the ICC issued an arrest warrant against the President. It is almost impossible to get a Sudanese visa with a US passport. But, as I am told, half of the Sudanese parliamentarians are holding US citizenship and regularly 'commute' between Sudan and North America. Bizarre? Yes, thoroughly. Is it even possible? Apparently it is: welcome to Sudan! In the meantime, over one of the tastiest steaks I have ever had in my life, my acquaintance spills his heart out to me (allegedly a foreign spy): ""We have some of the best meat in the world... The embargo means, no chemicals, everything is organic. Sudanese are herders... Beef, sheep... Such a rich land! We have plenty of water below the ground. Our people are nice, they are peaceful, welcoming... We want to be friends with everybody in this world."" At the end, he helps to arrange a car for me, for the following day. He is not supposed to, as I am not allowed to drive anywhere in this country. Especially if he thinks that I'm a spy. Things are slightly confusing. But I am quickly getting used to it. *** Several African and foreign analysts now believe that the events in Sudan, the West's desire to destabilize it, to overthrow its government and ultimately to break the country into pieces, are closely linked to the horrific past and present of the rest of Central Africa, particularly to Rwanda, Uganda and the DRC. Others dispute it. The disagreements are often only over whether the main booty of the West was actually supposed to be the Democratic Republic of Congo or Sudan. In his legendary work, first published in 2004, CENTRAL AFRICA: 15 YEARS AFTER THE END OF THE COLD WAR. THE INTERNATIONAL INVOLVEMENT, Dr. Helmut Strizek, a German academic, argues: "" Most people expected that Clinton with his ""leftist"" leanings would pressurize the Bashir-Turabi regime into a process of democratization in line with the Bush-Mitterrand approach that had been adopted after the end of the Cold War. But things took a different course. Clinton and Madeleine Albright, the new American Ambassador to the U.N., considered Sudan to be a ""rogue state"" and the number one enemy in Central Africa. They therefore opted for a proxy approach (""get others to fight your war""), a well known strategy that had been applied during the Cold War. Mitterrand was unlikely to comply with the intended ""regime change"" in Khartoum. He was apparently not informed about Washington's Sudan policy and could not understand the effects this new policy had on the Rwandan problem. After the Somalia disaster of 3 October 1993, Madeleine Albright used all the tricks in the book to minimize a U.S. contribution to the UNAMIR peacekeeping force envisaged in the Arusha Agreements. These activities were the first signs that the U.S. wished to reduce its commitment in favour of power sharing in Rwanda, help Museveni and his friend, Paul Kagame, to win the Rwandan war, and find other anti-Khartoum allies."" The horrors in Rwanda occurred in 1994 and then the US-backed Tutsi RPF took power almost immediately there (or one could say almost simultaneously), the same year. One year later, Rwanda and Uganda began one of the most brutal and genocidal wars in the history of the 20 th Century - the one against the people of the DRC. The war continues until now, and is fought on behalf of several Western powers and business interests. By the recent count, at least 10 million people have already lost their lives. The West was interested in chipping off several resource-rich parts of Sudan, including the then so-called southern Sudan. Neighboring Uganda was extremely interested in the 'project', too. It was enjoying full impunity and was clearly emerging as a brutal regional power. It had already supplied, trained and hardened the RPF cadres, (before the RPF took power in neighboring Rwanda). It was already helping with plundering the DRC, and it felt suddenly ready to play and to think big. Not everyone was impressed. But the stakes were extremely high, and rebellious heads, those that did not want to support the West's Machiavellian designs, began to roll. Helmut Strizek continues: "" UN Secretary-General Boutros-Ghali was considered in Washington to be a ""French and Sudanese sympathizer"". He became a prominent victim of the approach to Sudan. Richard Clarke reveals a strange deal: ""Albright and I and a handful of others (Michael Sheehan, Jamie Rubin) had entered into a pact together in 1996 to oust Boutros-Ghali as Secretary-General of the United Nations, a secret plan we had called Operation Orient Express (...). The entire operation had strengthened Albright's hand in the competition to be Secretary of State in the second Clinton administration."" (CLARKE 2004:201/202). This pact was forged after an attempt - attributed to the Khartoum regime - to kill Egypt's President Mubarak during a conference of the Organization for African Unity in Addis Ababa in June 1995. ""Following that event, Egypt and we (joined by other countries in the region) sought and obtained the United Nations Security Council's sanctions on Sudan."" Well, Egypt was always on the side of the British colonialists, when it came to the wars against Sudan. Similar to his predecessors, Mubarak faithfully served the Empire. In 1998, Bill Clinton organized a 'meeting' in the Ugandan city of Entebbe, in order to amalgamate a group of the proxies - those willing to launch a war against Khartoum. Helmut Strizek again: "" Rather than promoting democracy the meeting was intended to prepare for war against Khartoum with the help of this so-called ""new generation of African leaders"". But the war never took place. Shortly after Clinton left Africa, an absurd war broke out between Ethiopia and Eritrea. Laurent Kabila, whose anti-democratic record - according to different reports in the press - had made Clinton feel very uneasy in Entebbe, used this war as an excuse to leave the anti-Khartoum alliance and try to get rid of his Rwandan ""protectors"" in late July 1998. As a result the anti-Khartoum alliance collapsed."" "" While the planned war failed to materialise, the joint U.S.-U.K. policy initiative to topple the Sudan government continued. Although Richard Clarke would like to make the world believe that the bombing of a chemical plant in Khartoum on 20 August 1998 in retaliation for the Al Qaida attacks on the American embassies in Nairobi and Dar-es-Salaam was a success story, in fact it was a failure. This attack only exacerbated anti-American feelings, because the Sudan government had apparently not supported Osama bin Laden after he left Sudan in 1995. The failed attempt to kill bin Laden the same day in Afghanistan reinforced his belief that he was protected by ""providence"" and so he stepped up the fight against the ""American devil""."" "" Despite the improved relations between Sudan and Egypt, there was no change in the policy to bring about a regime change in Khartoum before the end of the Clinton era. Even Jimmy Carter, who cannot be suspected of excessive sympathy with Muslim fundamentalism, disapproved of this inflexible approach in 1999. ""The people in Sudan want to resolve the conflict. The biggest obstacle is U.S. government policy. The U.S. is committed to overthrowing the government in Khartoum. Any sort of peace effort is aborted, basically by policies of the United States. Instead of working for peace in Sudan, the U.S. government has basically promoted a continuation of the war."" What Jimmy Carter said is definitely correct, but it does not, of course, apply exclusively to Sudan. It could be traced to almost all the conflicts in which the Empire has some involvement (therefore, to almost all of them), from those in Africa to those in the Middle East, including Syria. Helmut Strizek believes that the wars in the African Great Lakes Region were directly connected to the US attempt at destabilizing Sudan, that they were actually ignited by the West, for Sudan to be destroyed or conquered in the end. But many others, including a legendary Canadian international lawyer, Christopher Black, who has been deeply involved in the events of the region (where he was working for the ICTR in Arusha, Tanzania), disagree. Chris wrote to me, shortly after I sent to him Strizek's report: "" Strizek... He testified for the defense in our trial at the ICTR and put forward this thesis about Sudan. I think most of what he says is correct but found then and still find his theory that the war in Rwanda was about Sudan a little difficult to accept. It may have been one of the considerations for Museveni and the US and UK etc. but it was not the primary one. The primary one was the war on Zaire, to kick out Mobutu and break Congo into pieces, That was the central plan for the RPF, US, UK, Belgium etc. re Rwanda and I have a letter from Kagame saying so. Strizek was used by an opposing defense team in my trial to try to make it look like I forged that letter from Kagame and I went after him about that. I think he fell into a trap about that - that is that other defense team, who I am sure were working for the prosecution, tricked him into doing. We discussed it later and he admitted perhaps he had been wrong but would not totally retreat. But we are in touch still... So in my opinion, the rest of his paper is basically correct re the geopolitical situation and he is correct on who invaded Rwanda and is responsible for that war, but I disagree that Sudan was the central objective of that war - that objective was Zaire. I agree re Sudan's importance but I fail to see how the take over of Rwanda had any effect on the attempt to break up Sudan. It is not on Sudan's border, Uganda is. No doubt Museveni etc. wanted that result - but I could never quite see how Rwanda fitted into that picture except in general terms - that is the US etc. wanting to take over all central Africa which would make them stronger further north in Sudan etc. But it is clear from all the other evidence at the trial and that of the French expert Dr. Bernard Lugan and others that the main objective of the Rwanda war was to take over Rwanda so they could use it to attack and break up Zaire, which is what they did."" My comrade, a Ugandan opposition politician Arthur Tewungwa, agrees with Christopher Black, but he also thinks that the West 'drenched in blood' the entire region, whatever have been its 'primary goals': ""Sudan, Uganda, Rwanda and the DRC have all been the victims of a cross-Atlantic foreign policy that has left the region disfigured and drenched in blood. While the motives have been presented as altruistic, the net result has been dreadful. Loud Western propaganda based on simplistic interpretations has been the order of the day. Sadly this approach has drawn celebrities and other well-intentioned individuals who have contributed to suffering equaled only during WWII. Darfur, Luwero, Eastern Congo and Rwanda have narratives built that don't stand the test of objective scrutiny. Who will repair the damage visited on these places? The only answer is the victims. The do-gooders have done enough bad to warrant their exit left of stage!"" *** I then asked my close friend and a dedicated internationalist, Mwandawiro Mghanga, Chairperson of (Marxist) Social Democratic Party of Kenya (SDP), to comment on the situation in Sudan. He expressed, in his letter, a strong opinion and his support for the Sudanese people, against the sanctions and against Western imperialism in general: ""The economic and political sanctions imposed against Sudan by Western countries have existed for many years. However, despite disrupting the development of the country they have not succeeded into forcing the people with a long and proud history and culture to surrender its freedom to Western imperialism. Western countries imposed the sanctions against Sudan ostensibly for its violation of the human rights of South Sudan which until recently was part of Sudan. But even after the government of Sudan participated in the democratic process that gave birth to the Republic of South Sudan (RSS), still the West continued with its hostilities and sanctions against Sudan. Sudan is now accused by the West of gross violations of human rights in Darfur. Yet despite its propaganda, the West is not actually interested in solving the problem of Darfur but in undermining the government of Sudan, compromising its sovereignty and carving another country out of Sudan. After RSS and Darfur the West will encourage another region of Sudan to demand to split and so on until Sudan is left into a tiny country like Rwanda. In fact, until the RSS was created, Sudan was the largest country in Africa in terms geographical size and ethnical diversity. This did not please Western imperialism that was imposed into Africa through the partition and balkanization of the second largest continent in the World and sharing it among the European colonial powers. Colonialism then existed in Africa through the notorious tactic of divide and rule that it continues today. The goal of Pan - Africanism and African Union for regional integration and eventual political union of African countries has always been seen as a threat to imperialist's interests in Africa. In this context, Sudan like Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) with it rich natural resources is seen to be too big by the West to dominate and therefore all means possible are used to balkanize it. They do not even care that the creation of RSS from Sudan has escalated inter-ethnic violence, violations of human rights and undermined real freedoms. The national liberation hero of Sudan and leader of South Sudan John Garang was assassinated by the West ´with the connivance of the Ugandan government under President Yoweri Museveni because he was leading the struggle for the liberation of the whole of Sudan and not the creation of RSS. In the meanwhile, the sanctions against Sudan have only made the country more determined to safeguard its freedom and independence, to explore and implement self - reliance strategies and to search for alternative development partners - Russia and China. And so Sudan struggles and lives on."" Not everyone in Africa feels deep solidarity with Sudan, though. The country has an extremely complex history and relationships with its neighbours. My close colleague from Eritrea, usually very outspoken and passionate about the West's devastating involvement in Africa, this time just commented, simply and dryly: "" The only thing I can say is that in Sudan it's not similar to Eritrea - ours is a clear case of economic sabotage, injustice, and double standards."" *** The last day before my departure, I ended up working with a lady, an acquaintance of mine, who spent a long year working in Darfur. Are things there really as they are described by the Western mass media? We sit in the lobby of my hotel, drinking coffee, and I'm taking notes. No names, of course, no names here... But she speaks freely, confidently, and what she describes is actually not much different from the nightmares occurring in many other parts of Africa: "" It is extremely tiring working in Darfur. You don't realize it when you are still there; at some point it all becomes somehow 'normal', but then when you leave the place, it all comes back to you, and it is hard to keep living a normal life afterwards. You are asking whether it is it as horrible there, as we are told? Yes it is, and perhaps worse... Killings and rapes, refugees and despair, and great suffering of the people... But it is not happening, honestly, just because of this government, and the state-backed Janjaweed militias... although they can be blamed for many terrible acts, of course. But the other side is not blameless either. And local people almost never report crimes committed by the rebels, and the Western media hardly mentions them..."" What I want to know is what role the West is actually playing in Darfur? "" The West is definitely trying to encourage Darfur to leave Sudan. The West, even Israel, is supporting Abdelwahid rebels from Fur African tribe. It is not unlike what it did in South Sudan. Darfur is rich in uranium and other raw materials. The conflict in Darfur, and brutality of it, is actually being fuelled from outside. The UN peacekeeping force UNAMID is thoroughly ineffective in Darfur. It hardly interferes on behalf of the local people. One has to wonder, what are their mandates and true goals there. I asked and was told that they are there 'to report'. It often appears that the so-called international community is doing everything for the conflict to continue, so it could justify its push for separation. In the meantime, the refugees are flowing into neighbouring Chad, and elsewhere. In the camps in Chad, they are often screened and interviewed, by foreigners, even Israelis... I don't know what happens there, in those camps, afterwards."" As we speak about Chad - its top military brass is having a joint meeting with local, Sudanese commanders. The entire hotel lobby is filled with men in various uniforms. Some are armed. I then ask to be taken to the so-called 'open areas' outside Khartoum; places inhabited by the South Sudanese refugees. Like Darfur now, South Sudan had been, in the past, destabilized and encouraged to leave the Republic of the Sudan. The West did its best to create this the 'youngest country on Earth', rich in oil and many other resources. As I was already explained to on several occasions by foreigners who have been based in South Sudan, the place has been, from the beginning, an ungovernable, and an artificial country, ruled by local warlords but above all, by countless international organizations and NGOs. That was actually the plan of the West from the outset. The situation in South Sudan is now so terrible, that people are fleeing across the newly marked border, to the Republic of the Sudan. Before the breakup, the exiles would be processed simply as IDP's, but now they are 'true refugees', as they are technically coming from a different country. We drive slowly to one of the 'open areas' called Altakamul, in Alhag Youseif town. My acquaintances are feeding me with the latest data from UNHCR and other sources: ""there are now 7 camps for South Sudanese refugees in White Nile State, with a population of 101,495. And there are 35,507 refugees located in the open areas, in and around Khartoum."" How are they treated here? ""Right after the separation, there was a lot of talk about South Sudanese people being our 'brothers and sisters'. We were told to treat them exactly as we would treat our own people. Some actually have relatives here, even houses. But now, with the economical difficulties that Sudan is facing, things are becoming very problematic."" Altakamus is a tough, miserably poor area, covered by sand and dust. As with everywhere else, I am not supposed to photograph here. And as with everywhere else, I do. Garbage covers almost entire alleys and the sides of roads. The whole area consists almost exclusively of only two colours with some varieties of shades: yellow and grey. Only very few economic activities could be detected. At this hour, children should be in school, but many are not. So this is where the increasing number of South Sudanese people are now ending up; this is the result of yet another 'glorious' Western experiment on human beings: of mingling with the borders, creating new states that should serve the Empire's political and economic interests. How many more are 'planned' for this area? We know of at least of some others: Goma (the DRC), Darfur (Sudan), Jubaland (Somalia). *** I don't know where Sudan is heading. Despite many problems, despite its clearly capitalist leaning, corruption and economic troubles, I am impressed with many things here. Khartoum looks definitely much cleaner and safer than Nairobi or Kampala, two cities in countries that are fully supported and often loudly glorified by the West. In Nairobi, more than half the people live in desperate, deadly, even 'toxic' slums. In Khartoum, poverty has a much gentler face. Despite sanctions, despite everything... Sudanese leaders have many new grand plans for their country: new housing developments, a new international airport, new office towers, hotels, riverfronts, office buildings and shopping malls. Some of these projects are now delayed, or even cancelled, but others are ongoing and on target. Life is tough here, and much tougher in the provinces. Because of the sanctions, many goods and basic equipment (even those for the hospitals) are missing. No credit cards are accepted here. Inflation is mounting. Goods and services are often calculated in dollars, but there are two parallel exchange rates in place: official and the black market one. Several times a day I hear the same question: ""Do you like Sudan?"" I don't know. It is a complex place, but inhabited by warm, courteous people. Honestly, this is not my fight. Here I don't see a struggle, an attempt to build an egalitarian country based on social justice. But Sudan is, to a great extent, a victim. A place which has been placed on that horrid hit list of the Empire and selected for demolition. And as such, I feel, it deserves to be supported. I wandered through the National Museum, with its exquisite artefacts. Two local schoolgirls wearing headscarves approached me, demanding to take selfies with me, on their phone. At times, life appears to be almost 'normal', but there is always some tension. As we drive through the city of Omdurman, I ask my friend: ""Is it true what one reads in Western press; that they amputate hands for theft, that they are nailing people on the cross?"" She laughs, mockingly: ""Of course not! They got rid of these practices a long time ago! If they kept up with them, half of the government would be running around without hands!"" *** But who is who here, and who works for whom? I am told that imaginary 'spies' are really everywhere. One day, I was sitting with a friend and with a local filmmaker in a cafe, discussing the possibility of my returning here and making a documentary film. The filmmaker was offering to drive me to Port Sudan if I come back, even to arrange my visa and all the necessary permits. At one point, we began discussing my latest novel ""Aurora"" . He asked about the plot. I told him that the book is about the European cultural institutions, which are funding young artists and thinkers in almost all developing countries, then using the arts and 'culture' as a vehicle for spreading capitalist and pro-Western propaganda, silencing almost all rebellious voices. At first interested, the filmmaker became gradually very edgy, and towards the end of my explanation, he apologized and ran away from the cafe, faster than the speed of light. I never heard from him again. ""You hit the nail on its head,"" my friend began laughing, right after he vanished. ""He is funded by all those organizations that you mentioned. You scared him witless."" Before I left the country, all my notes 'mysteriously' disappeared. Someone entered my hotel room and took both notepad and my Mont Blanc pen, which was attached to it. The Mont Blanc had been, for many years, one of my dearest writing tools. Practically, it was not easy to depart Sudan. At the airport, my passport was endlessly scrutinized, and in the end I was ordered to produce my 'registration paper'. I was told that registration is not required for stays under 30 days. I began expecting the worst. But in the end, the security apparatus allowed me to leave. But which security apparatus was harassing me, really? Who is in charge in this country? I will most likely never find out. In 1898, during the Battle of Omdurman (and later in 1899 during the Battle of Umm Diwaykarat), British imperialism debilitated, and eventually ruined the entire Sudan. British forces relied on their alliance with the Egyptians. In modern history, the West has never really left this proud nation in peace. All the terrible attacks came in the name of higher principles. The West has always claimed that it has been liberating Sudan from someone or something. In the end, the Sudanese people have suffered immensely. Those who were supposed to be 'freed' were actually mercilessly sacrificed. Some things never change!

"Mosul will not be taken, ISIS will not be destroyed","Mosul will not be taken, ISIS will not be destroyed 27.10.2016 In June of 2014, the world was amazed to see the Iraq army - armed and trained by the Americans - losing ground to the Islamic State. Fallujah, Ramadi and Iraq's second largest city, Mosul , fell within a month. The operation to liberate Mosul was launched on October 16. Will the city be liberated from ISIS terrorists?In 2014, the whole world started talking about the emergence of new terrorists . The world could not destroy them as the Americans wanted to use the new terrorists to their advantage to struggle against geopolitical rivals - Iran and Russia. Now we can see the Americans trying to take Mosul. The Western press is full of rosy expectations about the imminent collapse of the Islamic State"" (a terrorist organization banned in Russia). Fallujah and Ramadi have been liberated - one only has to take the two-million-strong Mosul, and the trick is done. Yet, the trick does not seem to be that simple. Firstly, Mosul is a city with a Sunni population in the Shiite-ruled country. This is the first resistance factor. Secondly, Mosul is the actual capital of the Islamic State - this is a city, the status of which determines the status of the Islamists. Therefore, there will be fierce battles, a humanitarian catastrophe and up to one million refugees. This is where Russia will be able to draw a parallel with Aleppo - something the Americans will not like. In pictures: The storm of Mosul, Iraq Nevertheless, if we do not see all that, and 9,000 ISIS fighters will leave Mosul, it will mean that they have been affiliated with Turkey and the United States. It is not hard to guess where the Turks and the Americans will send them to - to Syria: Deir ez-Zor, Palmyra, Damascus. Will there be US flag draped coffins coming from Iraq? The city is being stormed by motley and, one might even say, hostile forces . No one knows how they may fight for power during the operation. An Iraqi anonymous observer in Baghdad said that ""the offensive on Mosul looks hopeless, but one pins all their hopes on the support from the US, The Independent wrote. At least 12 US generals and 5,000 American troops are in Iraq, and they will play a crucial role in the fight. Five thousand is a lot, but what if the Americans start suffering losses? ""The Iraqis say that Mosul is their center. The Kurds say that the city is their center,"" Semyon Bagdasarov, an expert on Central Asia and the Middle East at the Center for Analytical Research told Pravda.Ru. Peshmerga (the Kurdish militia - ed.) is the core strength: five thousand Kurds are attacking Mosul, and what they will take will be their territory. The Kurdistan Workers' Party is also involved, and they are not going to share with anyone. All these are hostile parties, including the Turkish army and the Sunni militia. In general, it is total chaos."" According to Colonel Tim Collins, a former officer in the British Army, who fought in Iraq in 2003, currently the chief of the security service at New Century, the conflict may exacerbate further against the background of the conflict between the Turks and the Kurds. The Iranians would like to see this problem by increasing their influence on Iraq. The Syrians want to punish the Sunnis, the Iraqi army wants to restore its reputation, the colonel said in an interview with CNN. General Qasem Soleimani of the Iranian Revolutionary Guards could be one of the winners, Collins believes. Whoever becomes the victor in Mosul, the Islamic State will not be defeated , even if ISIS loses Mosul. The organization will recover in Libya, Afghanistan, Indonesia, the Philippines and elsewhere - whenever Washington needs those terrorists. They will not stop recruiting new members across the globe, because the Americans continue spreading their ideology to the Islamic world. Will Europe rebel against Washington, or will it continue to suffer from refugees and Jihadists? Lyuba Lulko Read article on the Russian version of Pravda.Ru Russia to save Iraq from ISIS",1
'Amazing idiots' will never isolate Russia's Crimea - Putin,"Print version Font Size On Wednesday, October 26, Russian President Vladimir Putin took part in the plenary session of ""Forum for Action. Crimea"" in Yalta. Putin paid special attention to urgent problems for residents of the peninsula.The forum is organized by the All-Russian People's Front with over 300 people participating - People's Front activists, federal and regional experts, representatives of executive authorities and journalists.Putin reminded that the People's Front was the first public association to have started working in the Crimea after the referendum on the status of the peninsula. A lot has been done since then, but there is even more to do, the Russian president said. According to Putin, one needs to focus on sensitive issues in the first place. It goes about such issues as the modernization of social infrastructure, transport sector update and creation of new jobs.""I hope that activists of the People's Front will continue their work to monitor and analyze most pressing problems that the people of the Crimea worry about most,"" said Putin. Previous forums (""Forum for Action"" took place in Stavropol and Yoshkar-Ola this year - ed.) have shown that such events provide an opportunity not only to exchange views, but also to find ways to solve problems.Putin spoke about the measures to overcome attempts to blockade the peninsula .According to him, the issues of energy and water blockade of the peninsula have been solved and removed from the agenda within the shortest period of time possible. The construction of the transport passage across the Kerch Strait continues according to schedule, the president added. ""I hope that all approaches to the bridge and all the necessary infrastructure will be ready on time and with quality,"" he added.In the future, the Crimean bridge will allow to transport up to 14 million travelers and 13 million vehicles a year.Those who try to blockade the Crimea are ""amazing idiots,"" Putin said. ""Did they think that the people would kneel and beg in front of them? Amazing idiots,"" Putin said. ""With regard to the termination of water or electricity supplies - all this stands on the verge of a crime against humanity. Let's take a sufficiently large region with many millions of people living in it - 2.6 million people live in the Crimea - and cut the region from water and electricity supplies in winter,"" the president said. ""It appears that our human rights organizations have swallowed their tongues and sown up their mouths and do not say a word, but as a matter of fact, it goes about a serious crime,"" Putin stressed out. Putin stressed out the importance of the process of the rehabilitation of Crimea's indigenous people. The federal program of development of the peninsula will assign ten billion rubles for the purpose. ""First of all, we are talking about the socio-economic support, because political issues have been resolved. It goes about language, culture and education in people's mother tongue,"" Putin said.The president noted that many villages of the Crimean Tatars remain in a deplorable state and lack even essential merits of civilization, such as electricity and roads. This resource, the president said, is limited and would only embrace the indigenous peoples who live on the peninsula at the moment.""Any funds allocated by either the Russian Federation or a republic, or by Sebastopol should be kept under public control,"" the president said.Vladimir Putin has the right to visit any Russian regions, including the Crimea, official spokesman for the Russian president, Dmitry Peskov, said commenting on a note of protest from Kiev. Ukraine sent a note of protest to Moscow in connection with Vladimir Putin's visit to the Crimea. ""Ukraine traditionally protests, as we traditionally do not take these protests into account. The President visits the regions of the Russian Federation that he considers necessary to visit. This is an internal affair of Russia, and it does not concern any other state, including Ukraine,"" Peskov added. According to the Ukrainian Foreign Ministry, the visits of Russian top officials to the Crimea demonstrate Russia's disregard of the state sovereignty of Ukraine. The Crimea became part of Russia as a result of the referendum held on March 16, 2014. According to the electoral commission, 95% of the population of the Crimea voted to reunite with the Russian Federation. Anton Kulikov",1
Mankind destroys animal kingdom with enormous velocity,"Mankind destroys animal kingdom with enormous velocity 27.10.2016 Print version Font Size The populations of vertebrate creatures - mammals, birds, fish, amphibians and reptiles - have decreased by 58% as a result of human activities from 1970 to 2012, The Living Planet report published by the WWF and the Zoological Society of London.The greatest damage was caused to freshwater vertebrates. Their total populations haves reduced by 81% during 42 years. The populations of terrestrial vertebrates have decreased by 38% and marine - by 36% in the same period. The report was based on the research data collected for 3,706 species of mammals, birds, fish, amphibians and reptiles.The researchers concluded that the most common threat to the vertebrates is either the loss or the deterioration of their natural habitats.""Wildlife is disappearing within our lifetimes at an unprecedented rate,"" said Marco Lambertini, director general of WWF International. ""We should not be deceived into thinking humanity can do without,"" he added.""Biodiversity forms the foundation of healthy forests, rivers and oceans. Take away the species , and these ecosystems collapse, along with clean air, water, food and climate services they provide us,"" Mr Lambertini also said. The experts predict that animal populations on Earth may decline by 67 percent by the end of this decade if humans do not take measures to curb the harmful effects of human activities on nature. Noteworthy, pollution-related diseases claim the lives of 5.5 million people every year. A half of this frightening number accounts for residents of China and India, scientists at the US-based company Health Effects Institutes said.The current level of air pollution in Delhi and Beijing may reach 300 micrograms per cubic meter of air, thus exceeding the limit 8-10 times. At the same time, North America, Western Europe and Japan have achieved great progress in the fight against air pollution in the last 50 years, creating cleaner fuel and engines, as well as reducing the consumption of coal. The main sources of pollution, according to the study, are emissions from electric power plants, factories, car exhausts, coal and firewood combustion products. The particles that the process of combustion produces remain in the air for a long time, thus posing danger to human health. In the capital of China, announcing the top ""red"" level of environmental hazard has become a commonplace event. Beijing was recognized one of the most polluted cities in the world. The concentrations of nitrogen dioxide and other harmful substances in the air of Beijing is the highest due to a large number of cars and the emission of chemicals from factories.

Venezuela: Will the army save the nation from chaos?,"Venezuela: Will the army save the nation from chaos? 27.10.2016 Vladimir Padrino The Venezuelan Parliament stopping the procedure of the referendum about the resignation of President Nicolas Maduro and urged the people for ""rebellion."" The Brazilian precedent has thus become a practice, which can be referred to as a ""legitimate illegal coup"". Why is so hard for Washington to topple Venezuelan President Maduro? Legitimate illegal coup Print version Font Size Not that long ago, Brazilian President Dilma Rousseff was removed from power in compliance with all constitutional procedures. Dilma was a leftist progressive president, who was accused of using loans of private banks to consolidate the budget, which played a crucial role in the formation of her positive image in the presidential race. This practice is frequently used in Brazil, but the opposition could not forgive Rousseff for winning the presidential campaign by a very small margin.The economic situation in Venezuela is even harder than that in Brazil. The country suffers from low profitability of the budget due to the fall in oil prices and wild inflation of 400 percent for the current year. The authorities of the country had to introduce cards to distribute foodstuffs. The current situation in Venezuela looks very much like the one that Russia experienced in 1992: empty stores, hospitals where you have to pay for everything and depression. In the parliamentary elections last year, Socialists suffered a defeat, and the opposition bloc won the absolute majority of 74 to 26 votes.The government of Hugo Chavez should have created reserve funds not to let all this happen. In addition, Chavez used to give oil, the nation's treasure, away to assist ""fraternal peoples."" The previous administration of Venezuela made a mistake when it decided to develop economic ties with China. Today, China decreases both investment and oil procurement. As a result, the parliament's initiative to convene a referendum about Maduro's resignation has collected a lot more signatures than was necessary. A survey conducted by Venebarómetro shows that 88 percent of Venezuelans want to vote, and 10.8 million of them want Maduro to step down, whereas 1.4 million are against such a move. However, the courts of five provinces of Venezuela canceled the results of the first phase of the referendum signature collection, making the second phase of the process, which was scheduled for 26-28 October, impossible. It was important for the opposition to hold the referendum in 2016. If the referendum is held after January 10, 2017, and even the majority of Venezuelans vote to remove Maduro from power, the powers of the head of state for the remaining two years will be handed over to the sitting vice-president. If the referendum is held earlier, new elections would have taken place - this was the prime goal of the Venezuelan opposition. Maduro wins in the legal field of Venezuela, but not the opposition. One can talk a lot about the corruption of Brazilian senators, who voted for the impeachment of Dilma, and the corruption of Venezuelan judges, who did not approve the collected signatures, but it is very difficult and nearly impossible to prove it. Therefore, the dispute between the executive and the legislative powers of Venezuela may take an illegitimate turn to repeat the events that took place in Russia in 1993 or in Ukraine in 2014. In both of these scenarios, the army will play the decisive role. MP Freddy Guevara has already urged the Bolivarian National Armed Forces (BNVS) not to obey the dictatorship and not to shoot at their own people."" However, the army is loyal to Maduro. Vladimir Padrino is the future President of Venezuela? Venezuela's Defense Minister and the commander of the Strategic Operational Command, Vladimir Padrino López, remains personally loyal to President Maduro. Padrino has recently been appointed the chief of the Sovereign Supply Mission (misión Abastecimiento Soberano) and the Second Vice-President, which will allow him to perform the duties of the president in the event Maduro is impeached after January 10, 2017. Secondly, Padrino successfully neutralizes certain divisions within the army, to ensure the continuity of ""Chavismo."" There is a group of those, who do not want to see Maduro in power, but demand the ""return to the roots"" of the Bolivarian revolution. There are also those who consider themselves ""apostates from Chavismo"", whereas the third group is controlled by Chavistas, Member of Parliament, Chairman of the United Socialist Party of Venezuela Diosdado Cabello. His people believe that ""some things need to change, but not through the toppling of Maduro, because Cabello is his political ally.""Vice-Admiral Rafael Huizi Clavier believes that Padrino holds absolute power in the army. He has his people both in the National Guards (internal troops) and in military districts (Regiones de Defensa Integral (REDI)), which is a crucial aspect. Thus, it is clear that Maduro will be able to retain power in the midst of a crisis with Padrino's help. Lyuba Lulko",1

Russian ships led by the Admiral Kuznetsov aircraft carrier will not enter into the Spanish harbor of Ceuta because of the naval group's route change, the Russian embassy in Spain said Wednesday. 
""We confirm that the ships will not enter the Ceuta port because the route has changed,"" stated the embassy official. 
Earlier the Spanish Foreign Ministry said that Madrid was considering granting the Russian naval task group access to Ceuta on October 28-November 2, drawing criticism from NATO. 
On October 15, the Russian Northern Fleet's press service said that a group of warships headed by the Admiral Kuznetsov, accompanied by the Pyotr Veliky battle cruiser, the Severomorsk and Vice-Admiral Kulakov anti-submarine destroyers, and support vessels, had been sent to the Mediterranean to hold drills and strengthen capabilities. 
Such decision may sound ridiculous due to the fact that a week ago Spain has signed the EU's announce on Russian's military offence in Aleppo. Moreover, two weeks ago Spain had developed a resolution that blamed Russian's military activities in Syria. 
Pravda.Ru's political expert Alexander Chichin revealed the nature of the contrariety of Spain's policy on Russia. 
Expert said that this decision is connected with NATO's attitude. Initially it all was referred to one tanker which was not an issue for Spain. Then they discovered that there was a whole fleet. Afterwards spanish realised that this fleet included aircraft carrier 'Admiral Kusnetsov', cruiser 'Pyotr Veliky' and antisubmarine aircraft carrier 'Severomorsk'. 
That's why Spain had to refuse. At the moment spanish people say that they are very ashamed for not refusing straight away. They are disappointed that they have recieved NATO's warn. 
It is worth mentiong that Spain could have got benefits from this proposal because the country needs money. These ships during only six days could make a great sum of money from Russia to Spain. 
Spain had to choose between its international authoriy and its inner financial profits. Abandonnig the proposal, Russia saved Spain from resolving this kind of dilemma.

Putin: Russia is not going to attack anyone,"Putin: Russia is not going to attack anyone   Pravda.Ru Russia is not going to attack anyone - this is silly and unimaginable, said Russian President Vladimir Putin, speaking Thursday   Vaildai   Club. The topic of the meeting is ""The philosophy of international development for the new world.""According to Putin, the West has been producing a great deal of myths about the ""notorious Russian military threat."" ""Indeed, this is a profitable activity, as one can obtain new military budgets and bend allies for the interests of the only superpower, one can also expand NATO and take the infrastructure of the alliance, its troops and hardware, closer to our borders,"" Putin said. President Putin called NATO an obsolete structure that was established in the times of the cold war. One does not see any adaptation of the alliance to new conditions, even though they talk about it all the time, Putin said. He also noted that there are continuous attempts being made to make the OSCE a tool to serve someone's foreign policy interests, despite the fact that the organization still remains an important mechanism to ensure European and transatlantic security. As a result, this mechanism works for nothing, the president said. Putin stressed out that Russia did not aspire to global domination and expansion.""There are many countries in the world that, like Russia, can rely on thousand-year history. We have learned to value our identity, freedom and independence. At the same time, we do not seek either global domination, expansion or confrontation with anyone,"" Putin said. Pravda.Ru  ",1

For the time being, I am not retired, I work as the leader of a large power, I have to be restrained, I do not need to show excessive aggression in what I say. I do not think that this is my style at all,"" Putin said   Valdai   Club.President Putin also noted that although attributes of democracy are still present in world's leading contemporary countries, but in reality, the majority of their citizens do not have any influence on power. "" Elections stop being a tool for change, they are reduced to scandals, to discussions of, excuse me, who sleeps with whom and who pinched whom . This is beyond all boundaries. Frankly, if you look at candidates' programs, you get the impression that they are all made according to one and the same pattern,"" Putin said. ""People feel that their interests come into contrast with the views of elites. Consequently, referendums and elections lead to more and more surprises for the authorities. People vote contrary to what respectable official media recommend, while social movements that were previously considered too leftist or too rightist come to the forefront, pushing political heavyweights aside,"" Vladimir Putin said, RIA Novosti reports. He noted that such uncomfortable results were considered as something very unusual at first. Afterwards, when they became increasingly frequent, they started saying that ""people do not understand those in power, that they are too immature to assess the aspirations of the authorities, whereas some others may hysterically scream that this is a consequence of external, primarily Russian propaganda.""

Putin tells the West of its own problems,"Putin tells the West of its own problems 28.10.2016 Source: Kremlin.ru On October 17, President Vladimir Putin , when visiting Sochi, delivered a speech at the plenary session of Valdai International Discussion Club. Most of his speech was dedicated to Russia's foreign policy and r elations with Western countries . America is not a banana country, but a great superpower Print version Font Size All the talks about Russia's alleged interference in the US election process are nothing but hysteria, he said. ""The list of mythical and concocted problems includes the ongoing hysteria - I can not call it otherwise - about Russia's influence on the course of the current election of the American president,"" Putin said, TASS reports. According to Putin, the United States is currently facing a plethora of problems - from the enormous public debt to police violence. ""Yet, it appears that the US elites have nothing to say to their people, to calm down the society. It is much easier to divert people's attention to so-called Russian hackers, spies, agents of influence, and so on."" ""Does anyone really think that Russia can somehow influence the choice of the American people? Is America a banana country or what? America is a great superpower, correct me, if I'm wrong,"" Putin said. Putin regrets Russia can not maintain a powerful propaganda machine comparable to Western media. ""I'll tell you, dear colleagues, I'd like to have such a propaganda machine in Russia. But it is, unfortunately, not the case. We have no such global media outlets like CNN, the BBC and others. We have no such opportunities yet,"" RIA Novosti quoted President Putin as saying. Vladimir Putin said that US presidential candidate Donald Trump represents the interests of ordinary Americans who are tired of the elites that have been in power in the United States for decades. ""As for Mr. Trump, he chose, apparently, his own way to reach out to voters' hearts. What kind of a way is it? Of course, he behaves extravagantly, we all see it, but I think that all that is not so pointless,"" Putin said. ""He represents the interests of ordinary people, who criticize those who have been in power for decades,"" he said adding that Trump represents the interests of ""those who do not like the transfer of power by inheritance.""One of the participants of the meeting said, making references to reports in Western mass media, that Russia supports Donald Trump in the American presidential election.In Putin's view, such an opinion has been formed by those who defend Hillary Clinton's interests in the presidential race. ""How do they do it? First off, they create an image of the enemy in the form of Russia, and then announce that Trump is our favorite. This is absolute nonsense and a way of political struggle, a way to manipulate public opinion on the eve of the presidential election in the United States,"" said Putin. Russia can attack NATO countries? Speculations about Russia being a military threat to NATO are ridiculous, the Russian president said. ""In the West, they constantly invent fictional mythical threats like Russia's military threat. But the fact is, Russia is not going to attack anyone, this is ridiculous. I have read your analytical materials - not only the materials of those present in this room, but the materials by analysts from the United States, from Europe - this is impossible, simply silly and unrealistic. In Europe alone, there are 300 million, all are members of NATO, the United States is a 600-million-strong nation, and Russia has about 146 million people. This is simply funny to just talk about it,"" Putin said. According to him, the true leadership in the modern world is not about the efforts to invent ephemeral threats and then use them to subjugate others. A true leader needs to see real problems and take efforts to solve them. ""This is how Russia understands her role today in world affairs,"" said Putin.Putin also criticized NATO for not adapting the alliance to the new conditions that have emerged in the world since the Cold War. ""The structures created during the Cold War have apparently outlived themselves. NATO is not adapting itself to the new conditions, even though they talk about it all the time,"" the president said. NATO strengthens defenses in the countries located along the border with Russia, amid growing concerns about the strengthening of Moscow's military potential . The decision on the deployment of NATO's four additional battalions in Eastern Europe and the Baltic countries (Poland, Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania) was adopted at the NATO summit on July 8, 2016, in response to Russia's actions in Ukraine. Terrorists are always smarter and stronger Using terrorists in one's political interests is ""a very dangerous game,"" the Russian leader said in his speech. ""Once again, I want to address to such players: in this case, extremists are smarter, wiser and stronger than you, and when you play with them, you will always lose,"" Putin said. ""The terrorist attacks of recent years in Boston and other American cities, in Paris, Brussels, Nice, in German cities, and, unfortunately, in our country, have shown that terrorists no longer need either cells or organizational structures - they can act alone, independently, it is enough to only motivate them ideologically and set them against their enemy - against us all,"" the Russian president said. Aleppo and Mosul Putin rejected the criticism of Russia for the bombings of Aleppo and reminded of civilian casualties in Iraq, Afghanistan and Yemen. The president compared the siege of Aleppo with the offensive on Mosul, which the Iraqi army has been conducting with the participation of the United States. According to Putin, terrorists shot about 200 people there while trying to stop the advance of the Iraqi army. ""Let's not forget it,"" the Russian president said.As Putin said, in Aleppo one needs to destroy the nest of the terrorists, while doing everything possible to avoid civilian casualties. ""If you do not want to touch anything, then one should not attack Mosul either, let's just leave everything as it is,"" Putin said. Putin also said that civilians are killed not only in Aleppo, but also in Yemen and Afghanistan, where they kill people right at their wedding parties. ""I think bells should be tolling for all of those innocent victims,"" he said. Putin stated that it will not be possible to stop the bloodshed and start a political process in Syria. ""It would seem that after long negotiations, enormous efforts and complex trade-offs, the united front against terrorism has finally started forming, but that did not happen. Our personal agreements with the President of the United States did not work,"" Interfax quoted Putin as saying. Today, if some countries benefit from certain standards or rules, they force other countries and everyone else to obey them too. However, if these standards subsequently become an obstacle, ""they throw them in a bin, say that they have become obsolete and then set new rules."" This strategy was used to attack Belgrade, Iraq, then in Afghanistan and Libya. The operation was launched without the appropriate resolution from the UN Security Council. Some superpowers, Putin said, in an attempt to take advantage of the international situation, have broken the international legal regime that prohibited the deployment of new missile defense systems. They have also created international terrorist groups and supplied weapons to them, even though the brutality of those groups makes millions of people leave their homes and migrate, plunging other countries into chaos. ""We can see the freedom of trade being sacrificed and so-called sanctions being used to put political pressure. Bypassing the World Trade Organization, they are trying to form closed economic alliances with rigid rules and barriers, where main beneficiaries are their own transnational corporations,"" Putin said. ""It is obvious that economic cooperation should be mutually beneficial and based on common universal principles, so that each state could become a full-fledged participant in global economic life, - said Putin. - In the medium term, the trend for the regionalization of world economy will continue, but regional trade agreements should complement and develop, rather than substitute universal norms and rules.""

Russia successfully tests its first-ever hypersonic weapon,"Print version Font Size The hypersonic aircraft , known as ""article 4202"" or ""15U71"" was successfully tested on October 25 for the first time. All avionics and electronic systems, as well as the control system of the vehicle are entirely of Russian production.The weapon is capable of speeding up to 15 Max, or 7 km/sec. The vehicle was designed to be installed at prospective intercontinental ballistic missiles, instead of conventional warheads. The ""4202"" vehicle starts working at an altitude of about 100 km and flies to the target at the speed of 5-7 km/s. Before entering dense layers of the atmosphere, directly above the target, the hypersonic aircraft performs a complex maneuver that makes it difficult to interception by missile defense systems of the enemy . Noteworthy, the project of hypersonic warheads called ""Albatross"" appeared in the USSR in the mid-1980s, as a response to USA's attempts to create a missile defense system within the concept of ""star wars."" However, due to the technical difficulties, the project was shut down. In the mid-1990s, the Scientific and Production Association (NPO) resumed the development of the new weapon under the number ""4202.""According to sources at Roscosmos state corporation, the successful tests of the new hypersonic aircraft were made possible with the help of the intensive import substitution program. For instance, Russian engineers had to get rid of the control system, previously manufactured by Ukrainian company Hartron. The successfully implemented program provided an opportunity to resume the tests. As a result, all the avionics and electronic systems, as well as the control system now completely consist of Russian components.The Russian Army is to receive new hypersonic weapons by 2020 . The development of high-speed anti-aircraft missiles has made it possible to intercept and destroy any modern aircraft or missile at any altitude. The way out is to create the aircraft capable of flying faster than interceptor missiles.For this particular reason, major powers of the world, such as the USA, Russia and China, rushed to develop hypersonic flight vehicles of different types and purposes. China, for example, tested the hypersonic WU-14 glider on 9 January 2015. The Chinese aircraft is launched into outer space with the help of an intercontinental ballistic missile. Then, the vehicle develops the speed of 10M, that is, more than 12,300 km/h, and dives onto the target. State-of-the-art air defense systems are unable to detect and intercept a target flying at this speed. China has thus become the third country in the world, after Russia and the United States, which has the technology of hypersonic vehicles for both nuclear and conventional weapons. In fact, the Chinese have created a warhead with control surfaces that can maneuver in flight thus becoming practically invulnerable. However, this vehicle does not have its own engine, so the Chinese creation has become another weapon for ""the poorest."" Russia currently works on different types of hypersonic scramjet missiles, which can be launched from land, ships or aircraft.Pravda.Ru requested an expert opinion from chief editor of ""Arms Export"" magazine, Andrey Frolov.""How competitive is Russia in the development of hypersonic aircraft?"" ""Russia is at the forefront. This is not the first test, I think that in the near future these systems will be passed into service at the army.

On August 24, the Turkish army launched Operation Euphrates Shield against the ""Islamic State terrorist group (banned in Russia). With the participation of the Syrian opposition, the military took control of the border town of Jarabulus in northern Syria and continued the offensive to the south-west. According to Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan, the goal of the offensive is to exterminate terrorists on the territory of up to 5,000 square kilometres and create a safety zone to accommodate refugees. In northern Syria, Turkish troops regularly come into clashes with the forces of the Kurdish militia, which they consider to be related to the Kurdistan Workers' Party. However, the official Damascus shares a different opinion on the subject. The Syrian authorities estimate the presence of the Turkish army on the territory of Syria as a violation of the sovereignty of the country, which could escalate the conflict. The Middle East has turned into the largest global puzzle, the pieces of which will never come together in the original pattern.

Russia stops shipping Soyuz space rockets to France,"Russia stops shipping Soyuz space rockets to France 28.10.2016 | Source: AP photo French newspaper Les Echos reported that Russia's state-run corporation Roscosmos will would not deliver Soyuz rockets to Arianespace of France. First off, Russia demands the receipt of the funds blocked in connection with the Yukos case. A statement from Roscosmos says that the Russian company will not work for free. ""No money - no products,"" Les Echos quoted a message from the corporation. It goes about 300 million euros, which Arianespace was supposed to pay to Roscosmos, but the funds were frozen by the Court of Arbitration in The Hague in the case of former Yukos shareholders . Previously, Roscosmos had won a case in France about the arrest of accounts of the state corporation in the Yukos case. ""They acknowledged that our arguments were correct, but we will continue defending our interests,"" director of communications at Roscosmos, Igor Burenkov said. On April 11, France arrested $700 million of Roskosmos and Space Communications money in connection with a judicial decision on the case of Yukos. Interestingly, NASA plans to purchase seats for its astronauts on board the Soyuz spaceship as Boeing and SpaceX seem to be unable to prepare their spaceships on time. US-based commercial companies Boeing and SpaceX are developing their own manned spacecraft - Starliner and Dragon. The deadline is near, so Houston has decided to consider a possibility to buy extra seats on board Russia's Soyuz. NASA hopes that at least one of the private spaceships will be able to perform operational tasks by the end of 2017 or early 2018. For the time being, one of the six necessary seats on the Soyuz spaceship costs the US nearly $82 million. By 2019, the price will increase.

Time to take a stand against the Demonic Duo: Saudi Arabia and Qatar,"Time to take a stand against the Demonic Duo: Saudi Arabia and Qatar 28.10.2016 Stoning a child who was raped by a Saudi pig? There are two pariah states in the Middle East, two bedboys of the West and two lackeys which implement western policy, two traitors to the Arab people, two blasphemers against Islam, two foci of evil, two followers of demonology, named Saudi Arabia and Qatar. It is time someone stood up to these disgusting and cowardly bullies. Nobody in the west is going to say anything against Saudi Arabia or Qatar, basically because the west is the world's greatest hypocrite and coward and is governed by corporate greed, into which world the Demonic Duo has wormed its way, rubbing shoulders with the elite, educating their children in the best western schools, doing deals with piles of cash stacked on a table. The west is the Dynamic Duo's whore. Print version Font Size Nobody in the west is going to say anything to their faces, or course, which does not mean they do not speak behind their backs. In the corridors of power, Saudis and Qataris are collectively referred to as fat, lazy good-for-nothings who pretend to be soooo religious at home then as soon as their aircraft takes off they consume whisky or else jet off to Casablanca, Morocco where little boys are lined up for weekends of sexual depravity. What did the Prophet have to say about that? A gay man was stoned to death in Saudi Arabia, forced to sit while a furious crowd hurled stones at his head, bellowing God's will is great, God is great. Allahu Akhbar. Welcome to Saudi Arabia! They are criticized for their disgusting human rights records, their revolting abuses against women, their pig-faced arrogance, holier-than-thou attitude, aggressive and intrusive intolerance. And so what does the west have to say when Saudi Arabia and Qatar commit war crimes in Yemen? Nothing. What does the west have to say when these two countries flood Libya and then Syria with terrorists? Nothing. What does the west have to say when Saudi Arabia and Qatar fund Islamic State, directly or indirectly? Nothing . A Wikileaks document released recently apparently points towards US presidential candidate Hillary Clinton being aware of the fact that Saudi Arabia and Qatar fund Islamic State, directly or indirectly but does the United States of America hold them accountable? Enshrined in the law in most countries is the precept that it is illegal to aid or abet or finance criminal activity and doing so entails accountability. Let us then take the only course of action available. This is not to sell weapons to Saudi Arabia and Qatar under the notion that ""if we don't do it someone else will"" so to Hell with ethics. A certain foreign secretary may recognize these words. But this isn't the Bullingdon Club, it is the real world. Saudi Arabia and Qatar may have wallets stuffed full of notes and they may have a lot of oil to sell, weekend breaks in cushy hotels to offer, call girls or rent boys to send to secret addresses. The girl was 19 years old. She had been raped. In Saudi Arabia, it is her fault because she was ""asking for it"". So she was buried up to her neck in the sand and her head was smashed open with blocks of rocks. Allahu Akhbar! Welcome to Saudi Arabia ! But the fact of the matter is, these two countries have been guilty of murder not only in Yemen but also in Libya and now Syria and Iraq. If they finance Islamic State directly or indirectly, then they are responsible for the acts of the demons they have created and should be forced to pay compensation to the victims, pay compensation to the countries affected and pay for the cultural damage to world heritage. If these two pariah states have directly or indirectly funded Islamic State then they are both guilty of the crimes they have committed. Any business with them is paramount to criminal association and therefore the international community should cut off the cancer where it stands: no contact, no business, no travels. No Saudi, No Qatar, no problem. How the United States of America does business with these two blasphemers after 9/11 defies logic - it is like welcoming the rapist who murdered your daughter into your home and offering him a banquet. It is time someone stood up against Saudi Arabia and Qatar, called a spade a spade, it is time someone outed these two pariah states for what they are, it is time Moslems themselves stood up against them. Saudi Arabia claims it is the home of Islam, organizes the Hajj and declares itself as being the defender of the faith but in fact in its acts it is the worst blasphemer of all, committing murder and masterminding, directly or indirectly, the satanic acts of Islamic State. But Saudi Arabia donates some 20 per cent of the Clinton campaign funding. So if Hillary Clinton wins, this satanic pariah, re-elected to the UN Human Rights Council recently, will continue to act as it pleases. Remember 9/11 anyone? Let's go kiss the Saudi's butt. Saudi Arabia and Qatar are an insult to Islam and to the international community. Mohammed must be disgusted with them.

November 8th: American Spring reaches zenith with Donald Trump Presidency,"Font Size are they doing humankind? Elsewhere, the U.S. State Department operatives were busy little bees. Again through NGO involvement the warmongers set their sights on Ukraine. The bigger prize though was Russia. By launching the Maidan Color Revolution chicken hawks in the U.S. Congress hoped to establish a bridgehead on Russia's very borders; the duplicitous MSM reported this intervention in terms of their own bias; it was vital to stop to 'Russian aggression'. Each step of every day the Kiev coup murderers continued to vilify Russian President Vladimir Putin. Wise to the U.S. 'end game strategy', Crimea, home to the Russian Black Sea Naval fleet at Sevastopol, voted to accede to Russia. East Ukraine was not as fortunate. To this day, despite signing the Minsk II roadmap for peace agreement the Nazi Kiev hordes continue to terrorize Russian speakers in the Donbass region; innocent civilians are killed and maimed each day by prohibited artillery bombardment from Ukraine. Of course, the junta blames Russia for the hostilities. The Obama Administration goes further: it tries to lure President Putin into the fray. The Pentagon crazies chomp at the bit to engage Russia on an open but foreign battlefront. Several new war fronts. It will continue The Establishment was not done yet. With help from the usual suspect NGO's, NATO opened several new war fronts in the Middle East. Syria and its democratically elected President Assad are in their gun sights; tiny Yemen is another potential military target to be exploited by Washington; but the Houthi militia has put up a fierce resistance. Oddly enough ISIS or Daesh is never on America's military radar screens; but when Russia fights the Islamic Terrorists it is headline news. Since a desperate Clinton invoked the Big Daddy, err, Baghdadi name at the third debate, the Mosul Campaign in Northern Iraq has commenced. The biased MSM deny coincidence. No one buys it. Given the chaotic and disjointed foreign policy 'objectives' of this current U.S. Administration and its crooked backers, Republican candidate, Donald Trump was compelled to act; he stepped in. The Donald entered the breach. Using clear logic Donald Trump has enunciated to Americans what needs to be done: change course; turn 180 degrees. Moreover, Trump has identified and charged as incompetent the real culprits behind this disastrous policy. Chief amongst those is Democrat challenger Hillary Clinton. Clinton was the sole advocate for these failed foreign misadventures. And people are going to vote for her? As a former Secretary State, Clinton was the sole advocate for these failed foreign misadventures in the Middle East. While under oath she lied to Congress as to her real motivation: broker arms to 'moderate' rebel groups in Syria. She continues to lie to the American people about Benghazi. During the Commander-in-chief forum, Clinton claimed no Americans were lost in Libya. Clinton though was remiss to mention the deaths of Ambassador Stevens and three others. Those four were murdered on her watch. With his legions of supporters massed around the country, Donald Trump is now poised to march on Washington, DC. All of the Establishment stooges are broken. Although they tried mightily the complicit media could not put Humpty-Dumpty-Frumpy candidate Hillary Clinton back together again. She is too far gone; with the help of Wikileaks, the electorate will soon learn more about her scandals and wanton corruption that she keeps hidden. Her feckless campaign is lost. Yes indeed; the one per centers got more than they bargained for; much to their angst. Contempt.... Scorn.... Slight regard.... Defiance! Come Election Day that is 'the movement's' message to the Establishment. American patriots are going for the knockout on November 8th. With President elect Donald Trump's help they will take their country back; make it great again! Montresor",1

""When a true patriot, an experienced politician, an outstanding statesman, a man with great intuition, with an encyclopedic education - when he learned about the bombings of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia by the United States, he did not see any possibility to continue ""business as usual"" with the USA.

Hallowe'en - The Day of the Aos Si,"Hallowe'en - The Day of the Aos Si 31.10.2016 And so the agricultural year dies, the underworld and our world reach the same level and there begins the time of the crossing of spirits from below to above, walking among us through the darkness of Winter. Hence the need to light fires and celebrate with festivals of light, hence the children dressed up as demons and ghouls. Humankind 2016, repeating prehistoric rites. Hallowe'en, the Day of the Witches, All Hallows' Evening, Samhain. Day of the Dead. Pumpkins, chestnuts, new wine, mulled wine. A bonfire, to keep away the evil spirits, the Aos Sí and to bring the community together, the first festival of light in the dark winter with little or no agricultural produce. What is the meaning of all these symbols? The end, or death, of the agricultural year in Europe happens around this time and as the centuries wore on, the Celtic peoples (and probably others) stipulated that at sunset on October 31 begins Samhain (pronounced So'win). This was a ""boundary time"" when the Aos Sí (bad spirits) could move easily from the underworld into our world and so bonfires were lit to cleanse the Earth from evil and to protect communities against it. Print version Font Size From the earliest times, children would go ""mumming"" or ""guising"", wearing disguises as monsters, witches or bad spirits, going from door to door asking for offerings of food and drink - or else people placed these outside their homes for the Aos Sí to take and be appeased. A time of darkness and uncertainty It was a time of darkness and uncertainty, a time when survival depended on how much food had been stored from the harvest and in what conditions it was in, a time when the wine or beer barrel was opened and which hopefully would last until Spring. It was a time when the fattened pig would be slaughtered and salted, when sausages would be made, hams smoked. It was a time before the potato, which was brought to Europe from the region of the Andes in the sixteenth century. What substituted the potato at the time was the chestnut, especially in Southern Europe, where a chestnut festivity took place at the beginning of November around a Magnus Ustus, a Great Bonfire. As with Samhain , the date became institutionalized and was fixed on November 11, the Day of Saint Martin. Medieval festivals carried across the waters In Medieval times, these festivities were still very popular in Europe and were carried over to the Americas by the Portuguese (Brazil), Spanish (rest of Latin America), French and British (North America), where they continued, while they became less popular in Europe and were celebrated locally by communities. In some cases, they took on a different meaning, as was the case with Guy Fawkes' Night, or Bonfire Night, in the United Kingdom. Guy Fawkes, an English Catholic, was part of a plot to blow up barrels of gunpowder under the House of Parliament when it was to be opened by King James VI of Scotland, James I of England (who became King of both countries upon the death of Queen Elizabeth I in 1603), on November 5, 1605. The plot was discovered, Guy Fawkes committed suicide just before he was hanged (he jumped from the gallows and broke his neck) and since then the day has been remembered throughout the UK with fireworks, bonfires, chestnuts and a stuffed doll representing the ""Guy"", children wheeling the doll around the villages asking for ""A penny for the Guy"". But this does not begin in 1605 - as we see, the symbology is the same as that coming from ancient times and the burning of the guy resembles the burning of the scarecrow in Iberian communities around this time. Humankind 2016, repeating age-old rites just because it is what you do at this time of year. You dress up, you light a fire, you dance, you celebrate, you go singing round people's homes. But you also come together and the community regulates itself during the darkest and most dangerous months of the year. A good example, togetherness. It is a pity that with all the resources at our disposal, we cannot perpetuate such moments throughout the year. Timothy Bancroft-Hinchey",1

Chinese spies steal from USA $100 billion a year,"Chinese spies steal from USA $100 billion a year 31.10.2016 Print version Font Size The Chinese intelligence has challenged the US national security system. China recruits senior military officials and conducts cyber attacks against the United States. What is worse, the Chinese intelligence has stolen Pentagon's plans for the future conflict with China, a recent report to US Congress said. The annual report from the US-China Economic and Security Review Commission has sounded the alarm with regard to the activities of Chinese security forces. The report said that despite extensive ties between Beijing and Washington, the US-China relations have remained tense during the current year, the Washington Free Beacon said. The relations between China and the United States have worsened primarily because of China's territorial claims in the South China Sea, permission from the United States to sell weapons to Taiwan, the deployment of the missile defense system in South Korea, Chinese cyber attacks and the US-led policy to ""restore balance"" in Asia.As for most serious threats, the report highlights cybercrime and the ""involvement of the human factor"" to gain access to objects of national security. The activities of the Chinese intelligence have increased significantly over the past 15 years. The work is carried out through the Ministry of State Security, the People's Liberation Army of China and military departments of the Communist Party, the report said. As for the ""human factor"", the report refers to the story of the recruitment of US Pacific Command Lieutenant Colonel Benjamin Pierce Bishop. The man was in an intimate relationship with a Chinese woman, who eventually recruited him. Thus, the information about US military secrets in the field of nuclear weapons, secrets of the Reaper MQ-9 UAV and the secret US report about the Strategy of the Ministry of Defense of China was compromised. The report also mentions a few other recruited gentlemen: another senior official of the Pacific Command - James Fondren, who delivered ""The National Defense Strategy of the USA"" to China in 2010. Another man, Greg Bergerssen, delivered state secrets to China before he was arrested in 2008. US naval officer Edward Lin was caught for selling secrets of the US Navy to China. All this information may undermine the military superiority of the United States by promoting China's military modernization and providing China with understanding of the tactics of military operations and other operational approaches of the United States to potential developments in the region, the report said. Noteworthy, China spies even on members of government delegations. For example, British officials, before going to the G20 summit in Hangzhou, were instructed to avoid contacts with ""Chinese spies who offer sex"", The Irish Times said. The officials were instructed not to take any gifts, especially electronic devices containing memory cards, SIM-cards or chargers as they could serve as a basis for video and audio surveillance. All the members of the British delegation were given temporary mobile phones and e-mail addresses. The officials were even recommended to change their clothes under blankets to avoid any chance of taking their nude pictures. ""Chinese intelligence has repeatedly infiltrated U.S. national security entities and extracted information with serious consequences for U.S. national security, including information on the plans and operations of U.S. military forces and the designs of U.S. weapons and weapons systems,"" the report said. ""Among the information extracted were 5.6 million fingerprints, some of which could be used to identify undercover U.S. government agents or to create duplicates of biometric data to obtain access to classified areas,"" it continued. China uses a variety of ""actors"" for its cyber espionage - from ""government contractor"" to independent ""patriotic hackers"" and ""criminal entities."" These groups often interact with each other. The US Department of Justice paid attention to the arrest of US citizen Allen Ho, who was accused of stealing nuclear technology for China General Group. Ho enlisted as many as six American engineers for the purpose. In addition, the DoJ and the FBI accused Chinese nationals of the theft of know-how technology for the production of carbon fiber for submarines and compounds for bleaching materials.The FBI evaluated losses from industrial espionage at 19 billion dollars a year. In one outstanding incidence, former Secretary of Commerce Carlos Gutierrez had his laptop hacked into and copied in Beijing, even though Gutierrez was one of the key figures in international trade negotiations. The information from his laptop was subsequently used to break into US government computers.James Andrew Lewis of the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington said that the stolen intellectual property of the USA brings China the profit of up to 100 billion a year. Interestingly, only a few Chinese spies have been arrested so far, John R. Schindler wrote for The Observer. The potential of the Chinese intelligence is high: 300,000 Chinese students studying in American universities.

"Clinton, FBIGate and the true depth of the ObamaGeddon","Clinton, FBIGate and the true depth of the ObamaGeddon 31.10.2016 Ladies and Gentlemen, we have a problem. Just over one week before the Mother of All Elections, we have information which shocks us to the core, freezes our hearts and sends chills shuddering through our spines. Ladies and Gentlemen, the problem is not FBIGate, it is the mechanisms behind the scenes which have not been reported. Read on. First off, how many times has President Obama blocked investigation into Hillary Clinton's affairs? You will never know. You will never, ever know because the system is rigged, there is no paper trail. There are telephone calls, there are meetings behind closed doors, there are threats. This time however, Obama was caught by surprise. The Nobel Peace Prizewinner, the one who insulted the Nobel Institution, the international community and all those who believed in his shitfaced lie ""Change"", the one who blasted Libya from the African country with the highest human development index back to the stone age, riddled with terrorists, including Islamic State, the one who stood back as Islamic State appeared under his nose... this one this time was unable to stop an FBI investigation because it happened behind his back. Trying to get at the truth Print version Font Size Ladies and Gentlemen, this truth will not come out in the next few days. For those with their political knives a-glistening and a-gleaming behind Hillary's back, waiting for some knock-out soundbites from those documents, it is not going to happen. Not because the FBI investigation failed to unveil juicy stuff, but because that juicy stuff will never reach the public domain. ObamaGeddon to the rescue, FBIGate quashed. And while FBIGate is quashed, watch what happens behind the scenes with the electoral system. George Soros is firmly in the Clinton camp, so they say. Does anyone know how many States use electronic voting systems run by George Soros? Does anyone know how easy it is to hack or rig these voting machines? These machines churn out votes. There is no accountability, there is no paper trail, the vote will not be verified. There will be numbers, statistics the day after, rigged. This is American democracy? The collective answer is no, the collective response is we all know this is true, we all know this is happening. Nobody likes Hillary, nobody trusts Hillary. So why vote for her? Investigating FBIGate Now let's see what my friend Nancy O'Brien Simpson turned up. She lives in the United States of America, she is a political commentator and she is a political activist: Secretary Clinton fell for the oldest hack in the book. This hack entails something called the ""Buffer Overflow Exploit"" that involves ""stacking"" a malicious computer virus in an area on your hard drive where virus protection software can't find them. Then it steals the files from the hard drive. A friend of mine who has been on the wrong side of these kinds of situations explained what he has read about how it all went down- Huma and Anthony are sharing a laptop at their home. Huma receives classified information from her boss, Hillary Clinton, in various e-mails and texts. She testified to the F.B.I. that she often emailed classified files over her unsecured Yahoo account in order to print them out at home on the laptop she shared with her husband Antony. When Huma goes to bed, Carlos Danger sneaks out in his pajammies and prowls 4chan all night looking for young teen girls to send them naked photos. One of these photos contains a computer virus that infects the laptop. This virus hides in photographs stored on a computer's hard drive by exploiting a photo's bandwidth. When the recipient receives photos in return, the photos contain information from the computer it has infested. The ironic part is every time Carlos Danger send photos of his ""wiener"" his nasty photos contained ALL the emails his wife received from Hillary as well as the classified documents she printed out.. This means some hackers out there on the net has EVERYTHING Huma brought home.. If the hackers are ""White Hat"" they probably told the F.B.I. to examine every one of Carlos Danger's nasty photos he sent over that laptop. If the hackers are ""Black Hats"" you can bet some foreign government has a lot of classified documents. The Clinton Crime Family will blame the Russians, which is laughable and serious at the same time.. You know they reopened the investigation BEHIND Obama's back because he has blocked the investigation of her at every turn. I heard the rank and file FBI were about to mutiny because they know she is guilty as sin and Comey would not prosecute because she is protected by Obama AND Clinton gave his wife half a million for her political campaign. This might be big, but Obama will stop it to protect her and his globalist masters. I rest my case. Nancy O'Brien Simpson Ms. Simpson was a radio personality in New York. She was a staff writer for The Liberty Report. A PBS documentary was done on her activism for human rights. She is a psychotherapist and political commentator.",1
Russia strikes with its new hypersonic missile,"Russia strikes with its new hypersonic missile 31.10.2016 A hypersonic aircraft known as Article 4202 or 15Yu71 was successfully tested for the first time on 25 October during gunnery drill from the Dombarovskiy launcher deployment area in the Orenburg region at the Kura Missile Test Range in Kamchatka. All the on-board equipment, avionics, as well as guidance system are made of the Russian components. The weapon is capable of moving at a speed of around 7km/s at the maximum height. The device is designed to be installed in advanced intercontinental ballistic missiles instead of traditional warheads. 4202 starts operating at a height of about 100km and flies to the target at a speed of 5-7km/s. While before entering thick layers of atmosphere above the target, the hypersonic aircraft conducts a difficult manoeuvre, which hampers its being intercepted by means of missile defence. It should be noted that the project of combat blocks named Albatros occurred in the USSR in the mid-1980s as a response to the US attempt to create missile defence in the framework of the Star Wars conception.

Why did Satan-2 shock the West?,"Why did Satan-2 shock the West? 31.10.2016 The recent publication of images of Russia's new intercontinental ballistic missile "" Sarmat "" created quite a stir in Western media. The Daily Mail, for example, terrified British readers with an article saying that the new Russian missile would be able to destroy England and Wales at once. The New York Post called the missile a ""devil in disguise"" which can easily reach New York City. The Daily Star published a map of the US East Coast designating the targets, which the missile could reach. The article even gives an approximate amount of victims (in millions за people). However, there were also skeptics. For example, Igor Sutyagin, a man, who had served nearly eleven years in Russia for espionage, and currently serves as a senior officer at the British Royal Institute for Defense Studies, believes that the new Russian Sarmat missile (Satan-2) is a fake. ""The design details are incorrect, and I doubt that this missile already exists in metal,"" he wrote, having analysed the photo of the missile. He then continued: ""The Russians want to tell the world: we are a great power, Fear us, and don't ignore us."" Print version Font Size As Pravda.Ru has reported before, the new missile is designed to replace the ""Voevoda"" complex (NATO reporting name ""Satan""). Military analyst Alexander Perendzhiev told Politonline.ru that Russia did not have to prove anything to anyone. ""In the West, they pay a lot of attention on Russian armed forces. In principle, the current series of publications fits the current anti-Russian hysteria trend. I do not think there is any point in trying to prove whether the news about the missile was true or fake. It's up to them to think and decide what we have and what we don't have. Let the debate begin. There is no point to prove anything here. Russia has to take care of its own security and give either proportional or asymmetrical, yet effective responses, in case something happens. In any case, we show that we are working. At times, we need to warn them, so that they understand that our intentions to defend our own security are serious."" Politonline",1
Trump teaches his supporters how to vote correctly,"Trump teaches his supporters how to vote correctly 01.11.2016 The US presidential nominee from the Republican Party Donald Trump called on his supporters to combat possible frauds the day elections take place the following way - to vote twice in case there are doubts that your ballot has been counted. 'You can go to University Center and they'll give you a ballot, a new ballot. They'll void your old ballot and give you a new ballot. And you can go out and make sure it gets in,' Trump claimed while speaking in Colorado. The case is that voters registered in Colorado get their ballots by mail. They also have right to demand a new one or vote in person at a polling station in case their previous ballot was not counted. Before that Trump claimed several times about imperfect election system of the US, which allows vote rigging. Last week the OSCE observers expressed their concern about fair voting while monitoring preparations for future elections, as there is 'a whole range of significant faults'.

The Al-Mayadeen satellite TV channel reported, that extremists applied projectiles rigged with chemical agents. The region of Al-Hamdaniya was struck. A military academy which is under control of the government forces is situated there. Both civilians and military men got poisoned. Later, Zahir al-Hajw, head of the Aleppo province forensic medicine, noted that symptoms of those injured evidence the use of chlorine. '41 people were delivered to hospitals after the attack. Among the symptoms are watery eyes, frothing at the mouth, vomit, nausea. There are mild and moderate severity categories. For the moment no one has been discharged from the hospital,' he said. The UN Envoy to Syria Staffan de Mistura had already expressed his indignation at the acts of the so-called opposition.

The search ended unsuccessfully, The New York Times wrote. The article in the newspaper said that the FBI was unable to find even one clue in the case. In addition, representatives of the FBI and US intelligence believe that hacker attacks on Democratic Party servers were most likely meant to undermine the election process, rather than the leadership of the Republican candidate. However, the FBI still said that the investigation into Hillary Clinton's email correspondence and Donald Trump's possible ties with Russia would continue.

Russia's 'White Book' on Syria shakes up UN Security Council,"Russia's 'White Book' on Syria shakes up UN Security Council   AP photo On Friday, Russia began distributing a curious document on behalf of the c hairing state of the UN Security Council - the ""White Book"" on Syria . The book contains the descriptions of the cases, when the US-led coalition was committing ""errors,"" as John Kerry once said. However, those ""errors"" can be categorized as war crimes . The actions of the Syrian ""moderate opposition"" are also reflected in the document. The 'White Book"" also contains statistics about the successful operations of the Russian Air Force and the delivery of humanitarian assistance to the civilian population in Syria, about the number of the liberated settlements, destroyed militants, as well as about the number of refugees, who returned to their places of permanent residence.The ""White Book"" was prepared by the Defence Ministry and the Foreign Ministry of Russia, as well as by specialists of the Institute for Oriental Studies.The ""White Book"" was translated into English and distributed for further reading.On 21 October the coalition attacked a funeral procession in near Kirkuk (Iraq). The pilots took the congregation of people for terrorists. As a result, dozens of civilians were killed. The recent attack of US pilots on the Syrian military near Deir-Ezzor also claimed the lives of dozens of soldiers. Later, US Secretary of State John Kerry, in a conversation with his Russian counterpart Sergei Lavrov, said that it was a mistake, apparently believing that such a statement would be enough for an excuse.""We have repeatedly said that such deadly attacks on settlements that have all attributes of war crimes, have become almost daily routine for the international lcoalition,"" an official representative for the Russian Defense Ministry, Igor Konashenkov said commenting o the attack of the funeral procession in Iraq.

""From 27 to 29 October, the vessels in the group had had their stocks refreshed to the level of established norms,"" the Russian Defense Minister added. Earlier, Shoygu expressed his bewilderment about the decision of several countries to deny the Russian warships entry to ports because of the pressure from the USA and the EU. The mission of the Russian naval strike group , which includes the Pyotr Velikiy missile cruiser and the Admiral Kuznetsov aircraft carrier, started on October 15. As the press service of the Northern Fleet said, the purpose of the mission is to ensure Russia's naval presence in operationally important areas of the oceans.""NATO fears that Russia may use the naval strike group to attack Aleppo. Representatives of the Russian Foreign Ministry said, in turn, that there was no reason for such concerns as Russian warships had always been present in the Mediterranean Sea. Meanwhile, Western media believe that Russia wants to seize the initiative on Syria and launch an offensive on Aleppo while the US is busy with the presidential election. It was in particular said that Russia would launch the decisive operation after the arrival of the Russian aircraft carrier Admiral Kuznetsov to the Syrian shore. This information is unlikely to be true as Russia's only aircraft carrier will not be able to considerably increase the opportunities of the Russian Air Force in Syria.

The commission had been in charge of water relations between India and Pakistan since 1960, when the countries signed the Indus Waters Treaty. Islamabad, in turn, declared it a hostile action on the part of New Delhi and said that such a move of the Indian government would be regarded as ""an act of declaration of war.""The problem remains serious not only because of the irreconcilable hostility between India and Pakistan, but also because of the growing consumption of water in China and Afghanistan - the adjacent countries to India and Pakistan.The Indian subcontinent already has water supplies problems, and the further increase of the shortage of water resources may give rise to internal political instability in the country. The instability will in turn push the country's leadership to a move to ""solve all problems at once.""

According to the Stockholm Peace Research Institute, Russia and the United States currently own fewer nuclear weapons than they did during the Cold War. However, even though both Russia and the USA have 7,000 warheads each, the countries still own approximately 90% of all nuclear weapons in the world.The former minister, speaking in Brussels to foreign ministers of Ukraine and Poland and a US congressman, said: ""We now have fewer nuclear warheads , but the risk that they will be used, is increasing.""He also accused the United States and Europe of raising such risks by deploying the European missile defense system. A part of the nuclear shield is being built on one of the bases in Poland. The missile defense system will be deployed in 2018, which is particularly sensitive for the Kremlin, as the US missile defense system will be taken very close to Russia's borders.

A few days later, in Treblinka concentration camp, Korczak and his children entered a gas chamber.On the way to death, Korczak was holding two of the youngest children, telling them a fairy tale story. Naturally, the little kids did not even suspect what was going to happen to them. In principle, one does not have to know more about the man whose name was Janusz Korczak. However, one does need to read the list of ten commandments that the amazing man recommended to parents for the education of children:1. Do not expect your child to be what you are or what you want him to be. Help him become what he is, rather than what you are. 2. Do not expect the child to repay you for all that you have done for him. You gave him life, so how can he repay you? He will give life to another and so on and so forth, and this is an irreversible law of gratitude.3. Do not vent your grievances on the child, not to eat the bitter bread in old age. You reap what you sow. 4. Do not look down at your child's problems. Life is challenging to all, and it can be even more challenging to children, as children have no life experience.5. Do not humiliate your child!6. Do not forget that most important encounters that a person has in their life is encounters with children. Pay more attention to children - we never know whom we meet in a child.7. Do not torment yourself, if you can not do something for your child, just remember: you have not done enough for a child, if you have not done everything possible. 8. The child is not a tyrant, who takes over your whole life. The child is not just your flesh and blood. The child is a Holy Grail that Life gave you to keep and light up the creative fire. The child is the liberated love of his mother and father, who will grow not just ""our"" or ""their"" child - they will grow a soul that was given to them to care for. 9. Be able to love someone else's child. Never do to someone else's child the things that you would never like to be done to yours. 10. Love your child no matter what kind of people they might be - untalented, unsuccessful, or already adult. Rejoice when interacting with your child, because your child is a celebration that you still have. Newsinfo",1
Russian paper of US errors in Syria shakes UN,"Russian paper of US errors in Syria shakes UN 01.11.2016 Last Friday Russia started distributing a White Paper on Syria as an official document on behalf of the UN Security Council. The paper comprises all the events when the US-led coalition was making 'faults' as John Kerry said, which can be qualified as military crimes. The acts of so-called 'moderate opposition' are also present in the document. Beside that, there has been collected statistics on the successful operations of the Russian Aerospace Forces, delivery of humanitarian aid to the civilians, quantity of liberated cities, annihilated fighters, as well as the number of refugees that returned home. The Russian Defence and Foreign Ministries have been engaged in work on the White Paper, as well as experts from the Institute of Oriental Studies at the Russian Academy of Sciences.

MI5: Bonds to save UK from Russian spies,"MI5: Bonds to save UK from Russian spies 02.11.2016 Andrew Parker, Head of the British Counter-Intelligence Servive MI5, claimed that Russia is a growing threat to the stability of Great Britain and is using all the possible tools to attain its goals. In an interview with the Guardian, Parker said, 'It is using its whole range of state organs and powers to push its foreign policy abroad in increasingly aggressive ways - involving propaganda, espionage, subversion and cyber-attacks'. According to him, Russia is currently working across the whole Europe and the UK, and the MI5 is to oppose it. There re a lot of Russian intelligence officers in the territory of Great Britain, but what is different from the cold war is that there is cyberwarfare today. Russia tries to get military secrets, information about industrial projects, economy, government and foreign policy, Director-General of the Security Service stated. As Pravda.Ru reported, before that the US presidential candidate Hillary Clinton claimed that Russia was responsible for cyber attacks on the US. The US special services went all out to spy on Moscow. It is planned that underground CIA agents will be involved as well as abilities of the NSA within cyber espionage, satellite systems and other means. Russia in its turn allocates minimum funds for espionage. Pravda.Ru",1
Obama running out of time to Pardon Clinton,"Obama running out of time to Pardon Clinton 02.11.2016 AP photo By Michael Wells Friday, 11 days before the American Presidential election, FBI Director James Comey announced that he has re-opened the criminal investigation into Hillary Rodham Clinton , former American First Lady, regarding the private email server that she used to illegally circumvent the government's official, secure digital record storage and retrieval systems. Why she needs to be pardoned During the 4 years that she was Secretary of State under the Obama Administration, she admittedly diverted all official electronic communications that she sent or received through her own email server, which was not secured properly to store sensitive government information. This left the information vulnerable to hacking by criminals or other governments. Moreover, the server was in her non-approved basement location, which even left the digital records subject to possible physical theft. Print version Font Size She controlled which official communications got passed on to the government and which were selectively held back from the historic record of our country, with common sense telling us that the ones that incriminated her never made it to the official record. The collection, removal, or storage of sensitive government documents in an insecure location constitutes espionage under American law, and Clinton's dereliction of duty in securing the electronic documents is all that is needed to prove a crime. Even if she had ""accidentally"" left the information unsecured, her negligence would still constitute espionage . Not done with her yet The announcement by Comey on Friday that the investigation was once again open (based on newly discovered emails that were recovered from a laptop in an unrelated investigation of the husband of one of Clinton's aides) was a serious blow to the Clinton campaign, casting light once again on Clinton's deceptive and megalomaniacal character . (Note: the case was never ""closed."" It was technically still ""open,"" pending finalizations and administrative procedures, but the investigation had completed and the case would have been closed pending those finalizations). Comey had originally declared the case against Clinton closed in July, stating that while Clinton had obviously broken laws, he felt that there was no reason to prosecute. This was a truly baffling decision, as the publicly-known facts of the case alone are enough to bring a successful espionage indictment. Not only had Clinton secretly housed and controlled government documents at her home, she actively destroyed subpoenaed documents . Clinton and her aides showed clear intent to mislead investigators in the face of a "" mountain of evidence of her criminal behavior ."" ""Although there is evidence of potential violations regarding the handling of classified information, our judgment is that no reasonable prosecutor would bring such a case,"" Comey stated in July when he originally ""closed"" the case. Equal treatment under the law Any other person in America who was investigated for mishandling state secrets, and there was ""evidence of potential violations regarding the handling of classified information,"" would face a swift and unpleasant prosecution for the Capital offense of espionage. They would be held in prison while the investigation and trial proceeded. One Navy submariner was recently charged with espionage for taking selfies in the engine room where he worked. Once he realized he was being investigated, he destroyed a laptop, cell phone, and memory card. He was charged under the Espionage Act and pleaded guilty to Retaining Classified Information on his phone, but the Obstruction of Justice charged was dropped. Even so, he faces 10 years in prison. By comparison, Clinton removed thousands of government documents, controlled which ones the government had access to, and housed them at her home for years exposed to hackers. According to the U. S. Code , this crime carries varying levels of prison time and monetary fines, with a maximum penalty of death, at the judge's disposal based on the actual specifics and severity of the case. The re-opening of the case is based on the recovery of several thousand new email messages, and it is going to take time to review and analyze the new material. This is not a task that will be completed before the Presidential election on November 8. Therefore, Hillary Rodham Clinton will be the first Presidential candidate in history to be under criminal investigation for espionage by the FBI at the time of the election... unless she is pardoned first . It seems that the only chance her campaign has of winning now is if she receives a Presidential pardon, and quickly. This would completely absolve Clinton of any wrongdoing concerning her email server, and prevent her from being subject to prosecution for the crime or any related crimes, now or in the future. Her espionage crimes against the country would vanish, as though she had never done anything wrong. The Clinton Family would simply walk away from Hillary's 4-year international crime spree that resulted in the deaths of many of our most loyal Americans, while she represented the United States of America and wielded all the power that comes with being the Head of State to her personal gain. Obama had better hurry The sooner President Obama pardons her, the better the chance of Clinton's campaign successfully righting itself by feeding lies to the voters and attacking her opponent, Donald Trump . Having been pardoned will restore much of her credibility with her voters, who would tend to see it as a statement of innocence. With only 10 days until the election, Obama will need to act quickly to save his magnificent successor and seal his legacy as the true enabler of the most corrupt politician in history .President Obama pardoned 98 people Thursday, bringing the total number of people that he has expunged of guilt this year to 688. According to USA Today , this is ""the most commutations ever granted by a president in a single year."" It sounds like President Obama is quite familiar with the process of ""officially forgiving"" criminals for their digressions against humanity. Why wouldn't he forgive yet another career criminal, then, in a desperate bid to keep his political party in power? It's obvious that he will . He is too much of a pawn for the Clinton Machine to rise up against their power. That's why the world witnessed the head of the Justice Department (Loretta Lynch) improperly meet with Bill Clinton (the husband of the subject of an ongoing Justice Department criminal investigation) in a jet in Phoenix. That's why Lynch promised to accept the findings of the FBI during the first Clinton investigation, no matter what conclusion they reached - even though she had never done that before. And that's why you saw James Comey buckle and ""close"" the case the first time. It was (obviously, to the layman) a badly orchestrated ""pretend Hillary didn't break the law"" order that came down from Obama. James Comey stopped his investigation, as he was instructed, and came up with the ""she's guilty but we're not going to prosecute"" line. Director Comey has finally stood up to Clinton by ""re-opening"" the case, and he's playing a dangerous game by investigating her again. It is a widely accepted notion that crossing the Clintons can result in one's death , usually with ""suicide"" or ""unusual circumstances"" listed as the cause. Of course, there are rarely and suspects charged in these cases. Keep them out In my opinion, the world would be a better place without the Clintons in power, and America should keep them out of the Whitehouse at all costs. The FBI won't have time to indict Hillary before Obama pardons her, and the most corrupt politician in history will be cleansed of all wrongdoing, ready to destroy the most powerful office in the world with her greed and sense of entitlement.

Interview: Why did Quito cut Assange’s access to the Internet?,"Interview: Why did Quito cut Assange’s access to the Internet? 02.11.2016 
Professor Doctor Mads Andenæs, a Norwegian lawyer and president of the UN Working Group on Arbitrary Detention, comments in the following interview with Edu Montesanti, for Pravdareport, on the Ecuadorian government's decision to cut off Julian Assange's Internet access. 
Assange was granted political asylum in the Ecuadorian Embassy in London in 2012 to avoid extradition to Sweden or the United States; the Australian journalist has access to the Internet denied since October 17, less than 24 hours after releasing John Podesta e-mails, the Chairman of the Hillary Clinton presidential campaign. 
Through official statement, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the South American country said it ""respects the principle of non-intervention in the affairs of other countries"", which led Quito to temporarily cut off Assange's access to the Internet. Print version Font Size 
At the same time, the Ecuadorian government stressed its commitment to protect ""victims of political persecution"" like Assange, and intended to ""safeguard his life and physical integrity."" Denying having suffered any external pressure for cutting the Internet, in line with the speech of US Department of State, the Ecuadorian Foreign Minister assured: ""We reaffirm that the protection of the Ecuadorian State will continue as the circumstances that led to the granting of such asylum remain."" 
WikiLeaks states that several US sources say that there has been pressure exerted by Washington on Rafael Correa’s government to restrict Assange's access to the Internet. 
Edu Montesanti: How do you evaluate the decision of the Ecuadorian government to deny Julian Assange's access to the Internet? President Rafael Correa claims that his country will not interfere in foreign elections: such a measure is really democratic? 
Mads Andenæs: That has surprised me. President Correa is one of my heroes, and I cannot understand well this latest measure. I understand that this latest measure is alarming to Assange. And it should be for all of us. 
Edu Montesanti: WikiLeaks tweeted after the incident: ""Multiple US sources tell us John Kerry asked Ecuador to stop Assange from publishing Clinton docs during FARC peace negotiations,"" while the United States Department of State denied the accusation, and President Correa said he acted on his own, and does not give in to foreign pressures. In your opinion, Professor Mads, Washington really pressured Quito, as says Assange? 
Mads Andenæs: There has been pressure, no doubt. What you cite here sounds credible, but again I only know what I have read in the papers. 
Edu Montesanti: Do you think the government of Ecuador will restrict journalistic work of WikiLeaks, in general? 
Mads Andenæs: I hope not. 
Edu Montesanti: Do you think Assange's asylum is running a risk? 
Mads Andenæs: No I really hope not. But it is worrying that so much pressure is brought to bear on the Ecuadorians. I am increasingly worried that Assange is not safe anywhere, in asylum or not. He has very good reasons to resist extradition. Remember that two UK Supreme Court justices dissented in the judgment about the extradition to Sweden, and the reporting judge and one of the Supreme Court justices in Sweden held the request illegal because it was disproportionate. 
Professor Andrew Ashworth, Oxford, advised that the Swedish request did not allege facts that constituted a criminal offence under English law. Professor Liora Lazarus, Oxford has held that Assange's detention is in vioaltion of international law, the chair of the English Bar Association Human Rights Committee, Kirsty Brimelow QC and the general counsel at Human Rights Watch Dinah PoKempner have all supported the ruling by the UN Working Group on Arbitrary Detention. The UK and Sweden should now just comply with international law as applied by the UN. 
Edu Montesanti: Do you fear that if the Ecuadorian opposition, pro-US, wins the 2017 presidential election, Assange will be extradited to America? 
Mads Andenæs: I really hope that they will not win, and if they do, that they will not renege on the asylum. Fear - yes strong reasons for much fear in this case.

AIDS epidemic in Russia: 'Crocodile' addicts of the 1990s to blame?,"Print version Font Size The authorities of the city of Ekaterinburg announced the outbreak of AIDS epidemic. According to physicians, as many as 26,693 cases of HIV infection have been officially reported in the city, which accounts for 1.8% of the city population.The Sverdlovsk region of Russia is the leader in terms of the number of HIV patients. In general, the human immunodeficiency virus has affected 20 regions of Russia. Billions of rubles are allocated to struggle against the deadly virus.Interestingly, however, Ekaterinburg officials subsequently rejected the information by saying that the ""the epidemic of HIV was declared in the city by mistake.""""In our region, there are many penal colonies, where the rate of HIV infection is high, - first deputy head of Ekaterinburg Health Department Tatyana Savinova said. - In addition, the population coverage for HIV tests in the Sverdlovsk region makes up 23%, while in other regions, at least 15% of the population are tested for HIV.""Ekaterinburg Mayor Yevgeny Roizman believes that the epidemic has broken out because of heroin and ""crocodile"" addict s of the 1990s.Pravda.Ru asked Director of the Federal Methodological Center for Prevention and Control of AIDS, a leading Russian scientist who devoted 20 years of his scientific activity to HIV infection problems, Vadim Pokrovsky, to comment on the situation. ""Ekaterinburg is a million-strong city, but they talk about the AIDS epidemic in such a large city in the 21st century. How can it be possible?""""In fact, this is a common process in all of Russia. Ekaterinburg is not the only Russian city with a high level of HIV infection incidence. There are many other cities, such as Irkutsk, Samara, Chelyabinsk, and even St. Petersburg, where one percent of the population is infected.""The epidemic has affected the whole country, and one should say it out loud instead of putting it in a vague form. This is an epidemic .""""Most citizens contract the infection through the use of drugs. Yevgeny Roizman, the mayor of Ekaterinburg is known as the founder of ""City Without Drugs"" foundation. How can one solve the problem? ""The problem could be about Mr. Roizman or other narcologists, who do not recognize methods of effective prevention of HIV infection in these groups of the population. In Europe, the transmission of the HIV infection via syringe needles was stopped due to needle exchange programs and substitution therapy. This is the only method that makes it possible to stop the epidemic among drug users.""Yet, Russian specialists believe that one should at first cure drug addiction , before proceeding to the HIV infection. All Russian drug addicts will be infected by that time, if it ever happens. It is vital to curb the HIV infection before eradicating drug addiction."" Pravda.Ru",1

NATO forces Russia to take retaliatory moves,"NATO forces Russia to take retaliatory moves 02.11.2016 Russia is forced to take defensive measures against the backdrop of NATO's increasing activities on Russia's western borders, Russian Defense Minister Sergei Shoygu said, speaking at a meeting of the joint board of the military departments of Russia and Belarus, RIA Novosti reports. At the July summit in Warsaw, NATO member countries agreed to build up military forces in Eastern Europe. Four multinational battalions are to be deployed in the Baltic States and Poland in 2017. To crown it all, NATO officials intend to strengthen the presence of the alliance in the Black Sea region. All these actions are being made in response to Russia's alleged threat, NATO officials say. However, Russian officials, including President Putin, have repeatedly stated that Russia would never attack any NATO country. At the same time, they added, Russia would not simply sit and watch NATO increasing its military presence near Russia's borders. Print version Font Size ""On western borders of the Unified State (Russia and Belarus - ed.), the United States and other NATO members have been building up their offensive potential by opening new bases and developing military infrastructure. There are continued attempts to impose the will of NATO members on other countries by economic and political dictatorship, as well as by military force. The information warfare is being conducted openly,"" Shoygu said.These actions, the Defense Minister said, undermine the strategic stability and force Russia to take retaliatory measures. The high level of cooperation with Belarus makes it possible to successfully address issues of strengthening the defense capacity of the Unified State, he added. ""This approach is especially relevant now, when international mechanisms designed to resolve critical situations are stalled, and hotspots of tensions have neared our borders,"" Defense Minister Shoygu said.

Can the Chinese intervene in a possible conflict between the Democratic People's Republic of Korea and the United States? Senior officer at the Center for Korean Studies at the Institute of the Far East, Yevgeny Kim, gave an interview to Pravda.Ru, in which we spoke about North Korea's nuclear program and the possibility of the denuclearization of South-East Asia. ""North Korea is a closed and little known country in many ways. Yet, who raised the question of a nuclear threat? After all, there are American atomic bombs in South Korea."" ""China has been involved in this actively during the recent years, but one should not attach much importance to it. The mandate of the six-party talks was about the denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula. The question is not only about the elimination of nuclear weapons in North Korea . One should remove US nuclear bombs from South Korea and exclude a possibility for any type of nuclear weapons to appear on the Korean Peninsula on the whole. ""US nuclear-powered submarines with nuclear weapons, US aircraft carriers with nuclear weapons and US aircraft with nuclear weapons violate the regime of the nuclear-free zone in South Korea. Look at the Goa Declaration that was signed by the leaders of Russia, China, India, Brazil and South Africa. There are more than one hundred articles in this lengthy declaration, but it contains no word about the North Korean nuclear issue.""Last year's BRICS declaration did not mention anything about the the North Korean nuclear issue. Therefore, the leaders of the five countries do not believe that North Korea is guilty of this problem."" ""Vladimir Putin said once that no one will touch a country if this country has a nuclear bomb. If it does not have a nuclear bomb, this country may experience the fate of Libya. What is Russia's stance on North Korea? Does Russia recognize the right of North Korea to have a nuclear bomb?"" ""The Americans would have shipped air defense systems to South Korea regardless of what kind of weapons North Korea would have had - nuclear or not. Russia is one of the great powers that has nuclear weapons, but Russia is not interested in the proliferation of nuclear weapons. Of course, Russia would not like to see the emergence of new nuclear powers in the world. ""At the same time, Russia understands why other countries have nuclear weapons. Russia always says that all countries should proceed from the interests of equal security. Why should the USA be worried about the presence of nuclear weapons in North Korea? North Korea cannot attack the USA. Even if North Korea has launched missiles into space , it does not mean that those missiles can carry nuclear weapons. Nuclear weapons have to be delivered to the territory of another state, and a missile has to reenter the atmosphere, where plasma can destroy it, but the missile has to remain guidable in such conditions to deliver its nuclear weapons to the target. North Korea does not have the technology."" ""Why does China keep silence?"" ""China understands the reason, for which North Korea has to develop its nuclear weapons. The Chinese realize that the Americans deploy air defense complexes to contain China and Russia, not North Korea. The Americans do not even hide the fact that they have another nuclear warhead to be delivered to Germany. Nowadays, one can test and further improve nuclear weapons without a physical explosion, and North Korea would need to switch to methods of mathematical analysis."" ""What will determine the economic development of North Korea - Sangun or reforms?"" ""Reforms, definitely. Sangun - the policy of the supremacy of the army - appeared in the mid-1990s, when the country was in dire straits. The country was forced to unite as a military camp and create the mobilization economy. Sangun made it possible to overcome a very difficult period in the history of North Korea, and the country continued its development, where rigid military control was not required. Now they conduct reforms."" ""Do you think a nuclear war may break out on the Korean Peninsula?""

If Trump wins : He has emphatically repeated a physical wall will be constructed on the Southern Border, offering job opportunities to tens of thousands of American Citizens and billions of dollars for both the national and local economies. Other employment will be created by maintaining and guarding this structure. American tax dollars will support American children, American veterans and American elderly. If Clinton wins : Illegal Mexicans present in the country with impunity, coupled with illegal driving privileges, illegal subsidies from taxpayers and dozens of other illegal ""freebies"" will not pause there. If Illegal Mexicans can break every other law in America why should sexual harassment, sexual deviancy and sexual assault be any different? Women should expect hundreds of thousands of additional sexual and physical assaults every year by people who have no legitimate excuse to be in the United States. In Mexico it is legal to have sex with children 12 years of age! Although often misconstrued or hidden by fellow-travelers , this is the fact in most of Mexico today. Likewise, ""bride kidnapping"" is not uncommon, as long as the predator-perpetrator ""trades"" something for the female child. And don't think Illegal Mexicans leave this ""culture"" at their border. In recent years have been instances in the United States when Illegal Mexicans have swapped a case of beer or other items as compensation for taking someone's daughter...and then used this ""justification"" in courts for being acquitted of a crime! If Trump wins : The 30 million Illegal Mexicans will dramatically be reduced. Their departure will lessen your daughter's classroom size while increasing resources for her school. You cannot have music, dramatics and sport programs when you double the class-size with non-contributing Illegal Mexicans. In very real terms, unless you are independently wealthy and can afford private instruction, the presence of Illegal Mexican children literally curtails your daughter's opportunities and minimizes her life choices. Moreover, at the same time the 30 million Illegal Mexicans begin to depart another 30 million Illegal Mexicans will never arrive due to strict border security. On average 2 to 3 million Illegal Mexicans are invading America every year. This will immediately cease with a Trump Presidency - to the benefit of your child's education and future employment prospects; not to mention your own quality of life. If Clinton wins : One of the most important things to know , and to remember when you vote, is many allegedly ""hard-working"" Illegals and Refugees (who have genuinely empathetic stories from their experiences) are entirely unable to function in the United States. With no disrespect, not a ""slander"" or a ""slur,"" it is a fact the vast majority are illiterate in the languages of the new homelands AS WELL AS most being illiterate in their own languages! The myth these people ""only want a better life"" or they are ""eager to work"" is revealed by the truth they simply cannot work in an Industrialized Society which already has extremely high unemployment for manual labor . Illegals and Refugees lack the training, lack the skills and most importantly lack the basic ability to learn them. In Germany it is now admitted only 1 in 50 of the Refugees are employable . Thus 49 of 50 will be on Welfare, receiving Free Housing, and collecting Taxpayer Benefits into which they never paid. At least one Syrian Refugee in Germany with 4 ""wives"" and 23 offspring claims $390,000 per year. We all hope for the best for our children, but if your daughter is less than a doctor, lawyer, or other highly educated professional - Illegals and Refugees will directly compete with her in the workplace. And if she cannot find a job there may be no Welfare Benefits for her due to it all being taken by Illegals. If Trump wins : In Germany the past 3 years are approximately 3 million Arab Refugees . Of the 3 million, even the government admits only 60,000 will find permanent employment. This means 2,940,000 uninvited people will be draining Social Security systems from hardworking taxpayers. With Trump a similar situation need never occur in the United States; where Citizens can care for fellow Citizens. If Clinton wins : She has announced in addition to 10,000 totally unvetted Syrian Immigrants, Hillary will increase their number over 500% to nearly 80,000 combined (almost all men of fighting age, with few if any women or children). Though sympathetic, these people have no documents and even the F.B.I. admits it impossible to know who is a terrorist and who a refugee. As example, whether organized terrorists or not in the first six months of this year even the ""approved"" Refugees have committed over 142,000 serious crimes in Germany; many of these being assaults of grotesque sexual nature. If Trump wins : There will be 0 new Syrian Immigrants to America since none can be ascertained non-threatening to the Citizenry. However financial and material aid will be sent to care for impoverished families in places near their homeland which are best suited by culture and religion to maintain them. If Clinton wins : While there are no exact predictors, Europe is a good indicator. In many nations girls and women have been warned not to wear shorts or skirts so as not to "" invite rape ."" Last New Year's Eve over 1,200 German women were assaulted by over 2,000 Middle Eastern Immigrants on one night alone . At a Swedish music festival this summer 5 girls were raped by Middle Eastern Immigrants in one afternoon. Many municipalities have reported ""swimming pool"" sex assaults on children as young as 6 years of age. These are not exceptions or indeed uncommon, but habitual. If Trump wins : Although not all tragedies can be prevented, with care many can be avoided. The best way is pro-active deterrence. If 80,000 Syrians are welcomed by Hillary (in only her first year of office, mind you) and only 5% are rapists that is 4,000 rapes which never need have happened. Worse, as ""Multi-Cultural Jurisprudence"" becomes pervasive in the courts (so to circumvent Immigrant riots like those seen in Paris recently ) we will witness even the worst abusers set loose to commit more crimes. Only last week in Austria , an Iraqi Immigrant who violently raped a 10-year-old in a swimming pool changing area was released by arguing his own ""Sexual Emergency"" and that the parents ""could not prove the rape was unwanted by the child."" This is a fate which awaits our daughters in America. THESE ARE NOT PROVERBIAL ELECTION ""HORROR STORIES"" - THIS IS REALITY IN EUROPE TODAY ! Do I like everything Donald Trump has ever said? Far from being the case!Do I agree with much of what Donald Trump proposes? Absolutely not!Do I trust Donald Trump will fulfill every election promise? Hardly! However since he has premised his campaign on the basis of Defending Against Harmful Immigration it is likely this singular position would be the last pledge he would or even could abandon once in office. Is Donald Trump a cad? Yes. Is Donald Trump a pompous lout? Yes. Is Donald Trump noxious? Yes.Is Donald Trump the ONLY CHOICE FOR WOMEN AND FEMINISTS ? - WITHOUT ONE SINGLE DOUBT ! For those unsettled by recent complaints against him, we cannot judge whether those who have accused Trump of inappropriate acts are telling the truth or not. There are a multitude of legitimate reasons why women wait to come forward with their stories of victimization. That being said, there are also a multitude of reasons why some women come forward only weeks before a national election. Yet even assuming everything alleged of Donald Trump is true, he has at worst used foul language in the past and made some very bad passes with inept physical overtures. NO ONE says he raped them. NO ONE says he ever tried to rape them. NO ONE says he did anything but back off once he was rebuffed. To the contrary, as of this moment there are women of all ages - from girls of 5 to grandmothers of 85 - living in Europe who are verifiable victims of forcible sexual assaults and rapes on a massive scale. These are not ""He said, She said"" or ambiguous private situations; this is an Epidemic Against Women . And it is ENTIRELY self-caused. It happened because Europeans ALLOWED it to happen. Americans CANNOT do the same! There is only ONE ISSUE in this Presidential campaign for Women - Mass Immigration From The Third World, especially of violent men from a hostile Middle East . This can be said with complete certainty because if you are raped and murdered, a real possibility under Hillary Clinton and her European Model of Misogynist Importation, you will not be ALIVE to vote in another election. For all women interested in women, protecting daughters, caring for elders, and with a call to each Authentic Feminist who actually works toward Women's Issues (rather than being Faux Feminists preening for cameras ) there is but one candidate who can and must be supported by all. Donald Trump may provide us many excuses to doubt him, from boorish behavior to partial-birth abortion. Donald Trump may give us a million reasons to loathe him, with his dirty mouth and surly disposition. And it is true Donald Trump may be another man in the Oval Office, causing us to wait just a bit longer for a female to occupy it. Yet Donald Trump is the only candidate acceptable for Women because he alone provides a clear and unambiguous stance on the ONE WOMEN'S ISSUE which counts most- keeping women safe and alive. This is not a television program where one character is fully good and one character is fully evil yet everything somehow works out in the end no matter who wins. If Hillary Clinton is elected, despite her platitudes about Women's Rights , tens of thousands of women will suffer and many of them will die. One candidate makes you feel good about yourself, but puts all women alarmingly at risk. One candidate makes you sick to your stomach, but has female-centric policies which actually protect them. There can be no hesitation that, for our families as well as ourselves , the one who deserves our vote is Donald Trump. Time is short - share this with friends, tell every woman you know ...and get yourself to the voting booth. Guy Somerset",1
Donald Trump the Hero of the Common Man,"Donald Trump the Hero of the Common Man 03.11.2016 In America, many people had given up on politics. Our Congress was bought and sold by lobbyists. Both parties seemed to be the same, the same neocon bombings of other countries. The same media spin. They felt they had been left behind. The corporations and profits were all that mattered, not the common man. They were almost resigned to the fact that they had no say anymore and that 'we the people ' was a saying and the meaning long forgotten as government got bigger and bigger,and became a Gigantic Leviathan sucking off the working-class people. Then, along came Trump. A businessman who was a showman. A thin skinned bully who mocked those he did not like. But, he was different. He was not a politician. He was not beholden to the corporate elite. In fact, the corporate elite despised him. Their media eviscerated him at every turn. He was mocked, scored, his every word grotesquely twisted to sound nothing like what he originally meant. Font Size They loved him, he loved them back And, yet, the people loved him. And, he loved them back. Rally after rally they came by the thousands to cheer their hero on. Hated by the elites and loved by the masses Trump himself began to change. Once only wanting to be a part of the elite crowd, Trump began to fall in love with his crowds. He saw himself as the hero of the common man and it felt good. Trump began to speak out against the elites who had bought and sold Congress. The said he wanted to ""drain the swamp"" and put term limits on professional politicians. The people loved him even more. The media painted and painted but... The media, controlled by the corporate elites continued to paint Mr. Trump as a womanizer, a racist, a xenophobe, and in cahoots with (gasp) Russia. To the Hillary Clinton supporters he could do not right and everything he said was suspect. He was vilified into the worst monster imaginable. No one in their right mind could possibly support him and those that did were themselves nothing but uneducated racists. But, Trump was not a racist. In 1885, he bought Mar-a-Lago. An estate in Palm Beach that he was going to turn into a chi chi club. Back then in the United States the tony clubs were segregated. Only white WASPS were members of the fancy clubs. Donald Trump said that he wanted his club to be diverse and he wanted it to be open to everyone. People told him he would lose money and no one would join, but he did not care he wanted it to be diverse. And, so it was. Mar-a-Lago was one of the first primer clubs open to everyone in Palm Beach, Florida. Hardly the actions of a racist. To those that love Trump he is the patriarch of a beautiful family. His children are beautiful and successful in their own right. He is a successful businessman who turned a million dollar loan into business ventures that made him a multi-bullionaire. They see a man who can misspeak, who can lash out, but they know his bark is worse than his bite. They see a man who isn't the greatest orator of all time and shoots from the hip, but they aren't so bothered by this because one of their loves for him is the fact that he isn't a politician with the rehearsed rhetoric. They see a man who's heart is in the right place. A man who loves America and her people. Trump is a patriot But, most of all, they saw a man who is a patriot. A man who is capable of bullying where bullying has never been done before, but maybe it was time a dominant male started calling out the evil that had befallen America. A man who wasn't afraid to call out the media bias, call out politicians in their corrupt dealings with wealthy donors. Wasn't afraid to say we needed to vet Muslim terrorists and not let them into their land. A man who was not afraid to say we need a wall on the Mexican border to stop the insane illegal immigration into America. Trump had become the voice of the common man! The voice of the silent majority that didn't think it mattered anymore. He has single-handedly destroyed the hold the corporations and elites had on his party. He has confounded all of the media, and all of every insider involved in politics. He wants to bring back the voice of the people who view him as their prince. The only person strong enough to take on the entire cabal. He has vanquished the Republican party. He is now tied in the polls with Hillary Clinton the mouthpiece and pasty of the corporate elitists and a neocon war monger. It is the prayer of Trump supporters, the common men and women in America, that their hero triumphs this week and wins in the most historic upset of our century.

Russian families with children in Europe have no way back to Russia,"Russian families with children in Europe have no way back to Russia 03.11.2016 Finnish human rights activists said that Russian citizen Svetlana Rots had had her two daughters taken away from her. The Russian girls were accommodated in a Finnish private orphanage, but were later distributed between Finnish families. The children were taken away from their mother not to let the woman take the girls out of Finland to Russia. A press release from human rights activists says that Svetlana Rots, a citizen of the Russian Federation, was born in Leningrad (currently St. Petersburg). During the recent years, the woman has been residing in Finland with her family. In November of 2015, the Finnish authorities took the children away from their parents. The Russian mother has been completely isolated from her younger, five-year-old daughter Carolina. The girl holds only Russian citizenship. The girl was taken away from her mother after the police received information saying that the woman could take the girl to Russia. Svetlana's elder daughter Sophia, aged 13, is also a citizen of the Russian Federation only. The girl was seized as well, but the Finnish authorities allowed the girl to communicate with her mother on the phone twice a week for 15 minutes. Print version Font Size It just so happens that Russian citizens can take their children to Finland , but they can not take their children back to Russia as simply an intention to visit the motherland is viewed as an act of kidnapping in accordance with European laws. According to coordinator of Russian Mothers movement, Irina Bergseth , this is not the first incident when Russian citizens in Europe have their children taken away from them just because Russian parents intend to leave the EU and take their children to Russia. ""Today, Russians with kids can enter Europe and can even have a child in Europe, but if a Russian family intends to return to Russia, Europe says that the Russian parents want to ""kidnap"" a child from the EU, so European officials act first to kidnap a child from Russian parents,"" said Bergseth. According to her, European child protection services used to kidnap Russian children mostly from mixed families (Russian-Finnish or Russian-Norwegian ), but presently, the practice has been expanded to the families where both parents are citizens of the Russian Federation. Russian human rights activists assess such incidents as a manifestations of hard core Russophobia . Currently, there is a large-scale campaign in Europe to ""persecute"" Russian families with children. ""It is necessary to set clear rules and procedures to return children, Russian citizens, to their motherland. While these rules and regulations are being developed, the Russian authorities should properly inform Russian families in Europe what they should do, if they had their children seized and taken away from them,"" says Bergseth. Earlier, Russian citizen Victoria Medvedeva found herself in a similar situation in Finland. The woman came to Finland with an intention to work there on a temporary basis. She had three of her children withdrawn from her. The Finnish authorities accommodated the children in a local orphanage. The woman's children - two daughters and a son - hold only Russian citizenship. The children were returned to Victoria Medvedeva after a while, owing to their father's interference. The family intends to leave Finland and return to St. Petersburg. Pravda.Ru Read article on the Russian version of Pravda.Ru",1

Will Trump make America great again?,"Will Trump make America great again? 03.11.2016 A few days are left before the presidential election in the United States. For the time being, Hillary Clinton has a slight advantage over her rival in the race, Republican candidate Donald Trump . In electoral votes, Clinton has 259 vs. Trump's 164 votes (270 votes are required for victory). It will be up to six doubting states to decide the outcome of the presidential election - Utah, Pennsylvania, North Carolina, Arizona, Florida and Ohio. Many experts believe that Trump will win the vote. Will he? First off, the United States is fed up with Obama and the Democrats, and it could be very well seen in the mid-term elections for Congress in 2014, when Democrats lost seven states and gave the vast majority of Congress seats to Republicans. The outgoing president had given many eloquent promises, but has not been able to keep them. Hillary Clinton is the successor of the dubious legacy of Barack Obama. She was part of Obama's government during his first four years as Secretary of State. The infamous Islamic State terrorist organization (banned in Russia) appeared during her stay in power. It was during Clinton's stay in power, when Putin started winning in the game against the USA, when the US Ambassador in Benghazi was killed and when the devastating Arab Spring started gathering pace. Print version Font Size A study conducted by Pew Research found that the highest approval rating of Obama (64 percent in February 2009) was the lowest for any US president since Eisenhower, that is, since the end of World War II. Also read: The many suspicious suicides surrounding Hillary Rodham Clinton Secondly, Clinton lies and makes mistakes all the time. She made her biggest mistake in her professional activities. She used her private email for officials messages, which is strictly forbidden in the USA. The FBI resumed investigation into the case a week before the election, having caused irreparable damage to Clinton's rating. Thirdly, a lot will depend on the turnout. Real wages of the middle class in the United States have not increased since 2008. The people who make the core of the USA want change that Obama has not given to them. ""Who's the candidate with the most rabid supporters? Whose crazed fans are going to be up at 5 AM on Election Day, kicking ass all day long, all the way until the last polling place has closed, making sure every Tom, Dick and Harry (and Bob and Joe and Billy Bob and Billy Joe and Billy Bob Joe) has cast his ballot? That's right.."" US film director Michael Moore wrote. Fourth, Trump personifies the American dream in real life. Donald Trump has made his name himself. Hillary Clinton amassed her fortune when in public service and lecturing Wall Street bankers. Trump's program says what the American people want to hear. The program raises such relevant issues as job losses, terrorist threat, immigration problems. Angry white Americans do not like the fact that various minorities in their country act as if they are a majority. Trump represents the conservative America. Therefore, immigration law, abortion ban, protection of military veterans, the revival of industry - these issues worry most Americans, especially those who go to church on Sundays and honor the commandments. Fifth, the Americans may vote contrary to propaganda. A man approached Michael Moore after a show, the director wrote in his article. ""Coming back to the hotel after appearing on Bill Maher's Republican Convention special this week on HBO, a man stopped me. ""Mike,"" he said, ""we have to vote for Trump. We HAVE to shake things up."" That was it. That was enough for him. To ""shake things up,"" Michael Moore wrote. Also read: Hillary plays Russian roulette in US presidential election Sixthly, 16 Republican candidates and the Republican establishment have tried all kinds of methods to fight against Trump , but nothing could stop him. Trump does not use anything but Twitter and meetings with electors in his election campaign, but he is still very close to Hillary Clinton. ""I think that Trump has very good chances to win. In fact, he has already left Clinton behind,"" Oleg Soskin, Ukrainian politician, economist and political scientist told Pravda.Ru. In this case, the expert believes, major geopolitical, geo-economic and strategic changes will take place as Trump's victory will bring in completely new people, forces, organizations, structures, systems, etc. For Ukraine, Trump's victory woud mark a political death for Poroshenko and his team. Germany and France will experience major changes as well, while the Baltic States will find themsleves in a difficult situation, because they completely depend on the United States. Tectonic changes will occur inside NATO as well,"" Oleg Soskin said. ""Clinton, if she wins, will protect the interests of global financial capital,"" Dmitry Mosyakov, the head of the Center for Southeast Asia, Australia and Oceania at the Institute of Oriental Studies, Doctor of Historical Sciences, told Pravda.Ru. - Trump's coming to power will entail serious changes for East Asia and the Pacific region. Trump says that America should pursue its own interests in the first place in both political and economic fields. I think that Trump will win, if the election is held honestly. He says truly Republican things to revive America's own businesses,"" the expert told Pravda.Ru. Also read: Donald Trump and the genius of idiocy ""The things that we can see happening in the USA now confirm my long-standing assumption of significant divisions of elites in the country,"" Karine Gevorgyan, a political scientist, expert on Iran, orientalist told Pravda.Ru. ""The hegemonic role of the United States has led to chaos both in domestic and foreign policies. Therefore, a serious split inside the administration may aggravate further no matter who eventually takes office as president,"" the expert added. Lyuba Lulko",1

USA: The questions the people should be asking,"USA: The questions the people should be asking 06.11.2016 Given the dimension of the United States of America, given its economic power and given the fact that it is one of those nations that cannot help sticking its nose into other people's business, meddling and intruding where it was not invited, the forcoming election is of global importance and requires responsible voting. Here are some questions the people should be asking. Question 1: Has Hillary Clinton amassed a substantial or any part of her reported great wealth (some say hundreds of millions of dollars) while in public office? If so, how is that compatible with public service? Question 2: Is there a rumor that Hillary Clinton has used the Clinton Foundation to amass a fortune and if there is, to what extent is it truthful? The Clinton Foundation and foreign policy Question 3: There is an allegation that Hillary Clinton has used the Clinton Foundation to receive millions in payments from foreign states for access to contracts in return. This being the case, how ethical is it for a public figure to use a private foundation to conduct government policy, and obtain a fortune to boot? Is this what the USA's foreign policy ethics is about? Then why vote for her? Print version Font Size Question 4: Hillary Clinton laughed and sneered when she heard that Muammar al-Qathafi, the Leader of the Libyan Jamahariya, had been cruelly murdered by terrorists. Is it correct for the leader of a country's diplomacy to giggle and guffaw at the news of a terrorist murder? Backing terrorists Question 5: Hillary Clinton was Secretary of State at the time when the Libyan government was toppled in an illegal act by NATO forces using terrorists on their own lists of proscribed groups. Is this in line with the established law of the United States of America? If not, then what does the law of the United States of America have to say about the chief of the country's diplomacy using terrorists to conduct foreign policy? Question 6: Hillary Clinton was responsible for sending Libya, the country with the highest Human Development Index in the African Continent, back to the dark ages, crawling with terrorists and infested by Islamic State. If she was capable of that as Secretary of State, then what would she do as President and how competent is she for that role? Question 7: Hillary Clinton, as mastermind of the Libyan debacle, is ultimately responsible for the acts of the terrorists she unleashed in that country. Has she, have the citizens of the United States of America, any idea of what these terrorists did? Reader discretion advised, for those easily offended please scroll down to question 8. These terrorists sliced the breasts off women in the streets, these terrorists forced five-year-old girls to watch their parents being tortured and raped and murdered with their throats cut, and as their parents' throats were still spurting blood and gasping for breath, these five-year-old girls were themselves raped before and after being beheaded. Boys as young as six have been impaled on railings (metal rails thrust through their anus until they come out of the child's throat). You cannot unleash this sort of filth, then laugh and giggle and turn your back and walk away. Or can you if you are the US Secretary of State, and get voted in as President despite it all? Question 8: How long has Hillary Clinton been in or around Government? How long has Hillary Clinton been in or around the White House? What has she actually achieved? Can she rightfully claim she is the Queen of Change? Or the Queen of barefaced liars who feathered her nest at the expense of the hard-working people of the United States of America? Question 9: Is there a rumor that a lady was paid 500,000 dollars to come on stage and lie about Donald Trump having abused her? Was it not more than a rumor? Wasn't it proven that she was paid to come into the campaign and lie? When they go low, you go high.

US Government and the Clinton female: Come to the Psychiatrist's Couch,"  America is going nuts. Suggestions stupidly abound about how Russian hackers are even going so far as to read people's emails. Of course there is absolutely zero evidence of this. Russians are being blamed for everything from flooded toilets, biting dogs, the tornadoes in Kansas, the kid's messy diapers, the car won't start and grandpa lost his dentures. Media encouraged hysteria This hysteria is being encouraged by the media, and especially pretentious, arrogant dishonest politicians and every deviant failure in life. Even in the hottest days of the Cold War such insanity didn't exist. The most blatant example of this recently was Vice President Biden boldly blaming Russia for hacking emails and trying to influence the election, promising that the United States was preparing to send a message to the Russian president, Vladimir V. Putin, over their plan to launch cyberwarfare against Russia and the Russian government. Days before, American intelligence agencies and the Department of Homeland Security declared that the Russian leadership was responsible for attacks on the Democratic National Committee and the leaking of stolen emails. Of course there was no truth to it ""We're sending a message,"" Mr. Biden told Chuck Todd, a talk show host. ""We have the capacity to do it."" ""He'll know it,"" Mr. Biden added. ""And it will be at the time of our choosing. And under the circumstances that have the greatest impact."" Later, after Mr. Biden said he was not concerned that Russia could ""fundamentally alter the election,"" Mr. Todd asked whether the American public would know if the message to Mr. Putin had been sent. ""Hope not,"" Mr. Biden responded. It was categorically proven that all of these crooked and dishonest politicians were just engaging in disinformation and war propaganda. From none other than the New York Times: ""Law enforcement officials say that none of the investigations so far have found any conclusive or direct link between Mr. Trump and the Russian government. And even the hacking into Democratic emails"" Video Do you think this is going to stop them? Do you think paranoid schizophrenic psychotic Hillary is going to stop going before Americans and telling them the Russians are doing this, that and the other thing? Hell would freeze over first. Repulsive Hillary was blaming Russians for all the problems she had caused with her corruption, her lies, her greed, her personal perversions and deviancies Hillary Clinton is a sociopath, she certainly does not feel the necessity to ever admit any of her distortions, lies and crimes. She's inherently dishonest, a sneak, a selfish person who has massive anger problems, who has hate names for all of her countrymen. She is a racist, she uses a woman card when there is no one more the antithesis of woman than her. As Pravda readers know, this failed female is responsible for the total catastrophe in the Middle East, from Iraq, to Libya especially (he, he, he we came, we saw, he died) and now Syria. Innocent Syria. Syria is a secular democracy in Middle East, well known for the diversity and tolerance of the society. No matter whether one is Sunni, Shia, Alawite, Christian ...people all consider themselves just Syrians. Divisions among the people are clearly a US/western INVENTION. Some great work has been done by: Vanessa Beeley and Tim Anderson Syrians are extremely righteous people who have always accepted, get this, ACCEPTED REFUGEES into their own country, protecting them from genocides and wars going on and now they are being attacked from without, from foreign terrorists sent there by the likes of Clinton and Obama... First ""Lady""? I wondered why ever since Clinton was first ""lady"" and I use the term lightly... Why was she so intent on bombing Christian Serbs, innocent Serbs, just defending themselves from the aforementioned mujahadeen that were first sent to Afghanistan (see video) and then transported to the heart of Europe causing the Balkan wars and the bombing of Yugoslavia by her husband, which she agitated for, to protect these terrorists. I hope most of our readers know that Bin Laden was an employee of the CIA and during the Balkan Wars, he was in possession of a Bosnian (Muslim area) passport. Yet this corrupt female rides herself that they decided to kill off their asset, Bin Laden. They are famous for killing off their assets....a warning to all considering entering such a position. Now with the revelations about Huma Abedin I understand that all this time Hillary Clinton is involved with Saudi Arabia, ISIS head choppers all various and sundry terrorists. See the report outlining this connection, heretofore hidden, secret, washed away. This is thanks to certain Washington insiders who probably don't like the idea of being wiped off planet Earth by a nuclear explosion being planned by neocons like the Clintons and Obama. Video During the debates, Clinton made her imperial declaration that she would impose a no fly zone on Syria even though no one invited the US there, nor did the US get UN permission while Russia does have the invitation and a directive from the UN. Her imperial declaration would mean World War 3. She accuses her opponent, Mr. Trump, of having ties to Russia yet Saudi Arabia provides 20 percent of campaign contributions to KKKlinton, who does their bidding. They also have given KKKlinton Foundation like 20 million, plus she was given half a million worth of jewels. How is Saudi Arabia not influencing US elections and no one dares speak of it and the connections to ISIS by all of them? Today's opinion makers haven't learned the lessons they should have from the Joseph McCarthy period of US history. The demonization of Russia and Putin makes McCarthy days seem like child's play when lives and reputations were ruined. In Hillary Clinton's world and in the US government's world, there is only free speech for themselves. All others not agreeing with their insipid, globalist, war hawk, neoliberal agenda are attacked viciously both in print and physically. International law is only brought up when terrorists are getting a major thrashing, then it's ""Oh no, ceasefire, ceasefire (another word for rearm, regroup, reinforce) oh human rights, oh killing innocent civilians, bombing hospitals...boo hoo hoo"". Of course they have been constantly doing this themselves ever since World War II. The occupation of Germany and Japan has never ended and nearly a thousand bases are maintained worldwide to maintain the empire. US military are not being used to ""defend their country"" but to defend corporations, lobbies, the military industrial complex. KKKlinton crime syndicate Obama, the KKKlinton crime syndicate, and the NWO globalists are seeking to depopulate the Earth by placing a demented paranoid psycho in power, someone connected to every filth known to man: terrorists, ISIS, Nazis, Wall Street, witches, bankers, rapists, child abusers, pharmaceuticals, GMO/Monsanto poisoning of the food, bombers spreading depleted uranium all over the planet causing cancers and birth defects with radioactive contamination for the next 4 billion years, the most feudal totalitarian anti-human dictatorships that chop off heads and other body parts, that give women no rights other than slavery, in fact someone connected to human trafficking. The US sends that failure of a UN ""ambassador"" Samantha Power to do a major job of projection (a sign of a major personality disorder) to blame Russia for committing the crimes that they themselves have committed. And you can rest assured that Russia does not ""do the same thing"" and commit war crimes, deliberately target civilians to ""break their backs"" and ""send them to the stone age."" These famous pronouncements can easily be found on the Internet. Russia does all it can to protect life, that's why Russian forces are in Syria. The psychos in Washington would have you believe that Russia is just there to protect Dr. Assad and his government. Washington consists of pathological liars. They claim that Dr. Assad is a brutal dictator killing his own people. This man is a trained physician who had planned to live his life as s doctor, but then was called upon to help his country. The truth is available to anyone on the Internet about what caused this terrorist attack on Syria, this is no civil war of a leader against his people. Those Syrians caught in this war flee to government areas for protection. During all of these ceasefires, the foreign backed terrorists continued to bomb and use chemical weapons on civilians in government areas. Never has Assad used chemical weapons and you can find the truth about this also. It all boils down to a failing empire, an empire in its final death throes, an empire gone INSANE. An endless stream of attacks on countries unable to defend themselves, regime change often of democratically elected leaders quite in violation of international law and subject to a war crimes tribunal much like that at Nuremberg: crimes against peace attacking civilians collective punishment And now their demon Hillary Clinton is seeking to finish the project of either ""full spectrum domination"" or take the world down with them. We, the free world community, have come to a conclusion and diagnosis of your mental condition, neocon criminals. Specifically, you have been judged as a danger to yourselves and others. Recommendations: indefinite confinement in a mental institution for the criminally insane. Anyone considering supporting Hillary Clinton should ask themselves these questions now knowing her connections to Saudi Arabia and ISIS/terrorists: Do you want to place a mentally ill psychotic lunatic in the White House and continue the insane policies of the neocons i.e. Clinton? Do you want to see family members thrown in a pit and shot to death ISIS style? Do you want to see family members knelt on the ground and their heads chopped off ISIS style, or maybe their hearts or organs cut to pieces? Donald Trump is a breath of fresh air to all citizens of the world who long for peace; long for attacks against defenseless countries to stop; for people to be treated equally and have jobs and security, health care and a future free from terrorism. It's not dangerous or anti-American to want to have good relations with Russia. Russia is a peaceful, democratic Christian country...not some monster bent on an empire such as Clinton and the neocons have promoted for the globalist takeover of all the peoples of the Earth. Let's not let planet Earth become a barren lifeless planet or a horror worse than Nazi Germany where no one is safe from being attacked by terrorists. The choice is clear, war with Clinton or peace and prosperity, a return to traditional values with Donald Trump and terrorists burning in hell where they belong.",1
USA: The questions the people should be asking,"USA: The questions the people should be asking 06.11.2016 Given the dimension of the United States of America, given its economic power and given the fact that it is one of those nations that cannot help sticking its nose into other people's business, meddling and intruding where it was not invited, the forcoming election is of global importance and requires responsible voting. Here are some questions the people should be asking. Question 1: Has Hillary Clinton amassed a substantial or any part of her reported great wealth (some say hundreds of millions of dollars) while in public office? If so, how is that compatible with public service? Question 2: Is there a rumor that Hillary Clinton has used the Clinton Foundation to amass a fortune and if there is, to what extent is it truthful? The Clinton Foundation and foreign policy Question 3: There is an allegation that Hillary Clinton has used the Clinton Foundation to receive millions in payments from foreign states for access to contracts in return. This being the case, how ethical is it for a public figure to use a private foundation to conduct government policy, and obtain a fortune to boot? Is this what the USA's foreign policy ethics is about? Then why vote for her?   Question 4: Hillary Clinton laughed and sneered when she heard that Muammar al-Qathafi, the Leader of the Libyan Jamahariya, had been cruelly murdered by terrorists. Is it correct for the leader of a country's diplomacy to giggle and guffaw at the news of a terrorist murder? Backing terrorists Question 5: Hillary Clinton was Secretary of State at the time when the Libyan government was toppled in an illegal act by NATO forces using terrorists on their own lists of proscribed groups. Is this in line with the established law of the United States of America? If not, then what does the law of the United States of America have to say about the chief of the country's diplomacy using terrorists to conduct foreign policy? Question 6: Hillary Clinton was responsible for sending Libya, the country with the highest Human Development Index in the African Continent, back to the dark ages, crawling with terrorists and infested by Islamic State. If she was capable of that as Secretary of State, then what would she do as President and how competent is she for that role? Question 7: Hillary Clinton, as mastermind of the Libyan debacle, is ultimately responsible for the acts of the terrorists she unleashed in that country. Has she, have the citizens of the United States of America, any idea of what these terrorists did? Reader discretion advised, for those easily offended please scroll down to question 8. These terrorists sliced the breasts off women in the streets, these terrorists forced five-year-old girls to watch their parents being tortured and raped and murdered with their throats cut, and as their parents' throats were still spurting blood and gasping for breath, these five-year-old girls were themselves raped before and after being beheaded. Boys as young as six have been impaled on railings (metal rails thrust through their anus until they come out of the child's throat). You cannot unleash this sort of filth, then laugh and giggle and turn your back and walk away. Or can you if you are the US Secretary of State, and get voted in as President despite it all? Question 8: How long has Hillary Clinton been in or around Government? How long has Hillary Clinton been in or around the White House? What has she actually achieved? Can she rightfully claim she is the Queen of Change? Or the Queen of barefaced liars who feathered her nest at the expense of the hard-working people of the United States of America? Question 9: Is there a rumor that a lady was paid 500,000 dollars to come on stage and lie about Donald Trump having abused her? Was it not more than a rumor? Wasn't it proven that she was paid to come into the campaign and lie? When they go low, you go high. I am not going to mention any names, but wasn't there more than a rumor about a certain family of Hillbillies in the White House, lies and er...? Timothy Bancroft-Hinchey",1
Mikhail Saakashvili quits as Odessa governor,"Mikhail Saakashvili quits as Odessa governor   Source: REX The Governor of the Odessa region, Mikhail Saakashvili , who is best known for eating his tie on TV while serving as President of Georgia, announced his resignation on Monday, November 7. ""I have decided to resign and start a new stage of the struggle. I am not going to give up. I am a soldier who walks as much as he can and then continues walking as much as he must,"" Mikhail Saakashvili, former president of Georgia said at a press briefing. According to him, it is difficult to improve the state of affairs in one region, while corruption continues prospering in the rest of Ukraine ""capitalizing on the blood of soldiers, victims of the Maidan and betraying the idea of ​​the Ukrainian revolution."" Saakashvili has repeatedly accused the Ukrainian authorities of corruption. On September 13, he called Petro Poroshenko's Bloc a criminal group. In December 2015, at a meeting of Ukraine's National Board of Reforms, an open conflict sparked between Saakashvili and Ukrainian Minister of Internal Affairs Arsen Avakov. The Interior Minister asked Saakashvili a question about the privatization of the Odessa Portside Plant. In response, the former president of Georgia stated that he was not going to discuss anything on the subject. Instead, Saakashvili added, he was going to prove that ""you [Avakov] are a thief."" Avakov splashed water from his glass at Saakashvili during the scandal. President of Ukraine called the incident shameful. Saakashvili was appointed the head of the Odessa region on May 30, 2015. Prior to the appointment, he received Ukrainian citizenship in accordance with the decree signed by President Petro Poroshenko. From 2004 to 2013, Saakashvili served as the President of Georgia. He has rarely visited Georgia since then, where there are four criminal cases pending against him. One of them was filed on charges of embezzlement of public funds for personal needs.

NATO declares full combat readiness because of conflict with Russia,"NATO declares full combat readiness because of conflict with Russia   AP photo NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg said that against the backdrop of growing tensions in relations with Russia , hundreds of thousands of NATO troops would be brought to a higher readiness. To restrain the ""Russian aggression,"" the alliance intends to prepare an impressive amount of ground troops, although Stoltenberg did not specify the exact number of the troops. According to the UK permanent representative to NATO Adam Thomson, the alliance seeks to speed up the response time of 300,000 servicemen from 180 days to two months. Residents of NATO countries do not want a military conflict with Russia , nor are they ready to deal with it, a poll conducted by Pew Research Center said. The survey found that residents of several NATO member states were not ready to come into a military conflict with Russia, even if she attacked one of the alliance members, RT reports. According to the poll, 53% of French, 51% of Italian and 58% of German residents are ready to sacrifice the principle of collective security. At the same time, one can hear NATO officials saying the mantra about the unity within the alliance. The main purpose for the existence of NATO is collective defense. If one member of the alliance is attacked, others are supposed to come to its rescue. According to the poll, however, 53% of French respondents did not support the idea of ​​the country's defense (51% share the same point of view in Italy and 58% - in Germany). The poll was conducted in eight countries of the alliance, but only in two of them - the USA and Canada - the majority of respondents supported the idea of using military force.

"Fifteen years after NATO bombings, Montenegro wants to join NATO","Fifteen years after NATO bombings, Montenegro wants to join NATO 07.11.2016 | Source: AP photo Montenegro's prosecutor for investigations in the field of organized crime, Milivoye Katnich, said that a group ""Russian nationalists"" was plotting to assassinate Montenegrin Prime Minister Milo Djukanovic, who is known for his pro-Western orientation. ""Organizers of a criminal group, who are nationalists from the Russian Federation, proceeded from the fact that the government of Montenegro chaired by Milo Djukanovic would not be changed as a result of elections, so one had to overthrow the government by force,"" the prosecutor said, Pravda.Ru reports. Pravda.Ru asked an expert opinion from an expert at the Institute of European Studies, Stevan Gayich. ""Is it a provocation of the pro-Western government? Who is standing behind it?"" ""What the prosecutor's office of Montenegro, and the Djukanovic regime in general, have been doing recently can be described as walking in the fog. The opposition does not recognize the elections, and the government has found itself in a deep political crisis. Djukanovic has already announced that he will not be prime minister if his Democratic Party of Socialists (DPS) forms the government. The socialists already say that the DPS has supposedly formed a government, meaning that Montenegro is sure to be a NATO member. In fact, however, the government has not been formed. They defend the interests of the West, so the fight has risen to a higher geopolitical level. ""No evidence has been provided. In my opinion, this story is completely fabricated in a very poor way to stir up some noise during the elections and create an atmosphere of fear among opposition voters."" ""How should Russia respond?"" ""Russia should at least respond on the level of diplomacy. Montenegro, as a historically Serbian state, used to be a pro-Russian country. NATO bombed Montenegro 15 years ago, and one had to completely change the identity of the people to make Montenegro a NATO member. One of the key points of the identity of the people of Montenegro, the Serbian people, is their attachment to Russia. One had to strike a serious blow on this peculiarity of the people of Montenegro to create a new identity."" On October 16, Montenegro held parliamentary elections. Twenty Serbian citizens were detained on suspicion of preparing a terrorist attack and a coup on the election day. According to preliminary data, the people wanted to attack citizens and police officers who gathered in front of the parliament with a view to proclaim the victory of one of the political parties and imprison the prime minister of Montenegro. Pro-Western Democratic Party of Socialists (DPS) of Prime Minister Milo Djukanovic won the elections. Pravda.Ru Read article on the Russian version of Pravda.Ru",1
"USA Continues Drive to Plutocracy, Dismantling of State","USA Continues Drive to Plutocracy, Dismantling of State 07.11.2016 Source: Pravda.Ru archive By John Stanton Interest groups and lobbyists have been busy peddling their client's interests since 1816 when Delaware manufacturer Isaac Briggs teamed up with his colleagues in an attempt to convince federal lawmakers to impose tariffs on the import of foreign made manufactures. Alexis de Tocqueville writing in his two volume set Democracy in America (1835, 1840) observed the unique American characteristic of banding together in civic and issue specific interest groups for the purpose of influencing lawmakers, regulators and public opinion at the local, state and national levels. Print version Font Size Congressional legislation to limit the influence of lobbyists in the US Congress and the federal government at large arguably did not being in earnest until the 20th Century. The landmark Foreign Agents Registration Act 1938, passed on the eve of World War II, ""requires persons acting as agents of foreign principals in a political or quasi-political capacity to make periodic public disclosure of their relationship with the foreign principal, as well as activities, receipts and disbursements in support of those activities requiring foreign company or government."" That act remains in force today. Nice Try The Federal Regulation of Lobbying Act of 1946, the Lobbying Disclosure Act of 1995 and the Honest Leadership and Open Government Act of 2007 are notable for their attempts to inform the public who was lobbying for what interest and for how much money. The Open Government Act of 2007 mandated a one year waiting period for federal public servants before they could make the move through the revolving door to lucrative for-profit opportunities. President Barak Obama issued an Executive Order in 2009 known as the Ethics Commitments by Executive Branch Personnel. That decree sought to impose a two year waiting period for executive branch appointees. US executive branch agencies can also write their own lobbying rules or modify those contained in legislative acts. Members of the US Congress can also play an active role above and beyond legislative actions. On December 18, 2008, then Senators John Kerry from Massachusetts and Richard Lugar of Indiana sent a memorandum of understanding (MOU) to the Clinton Foundation, and the soon to be confirmed US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, limiting the Clinton Foundation's interactions with foreign governments. In the MOU, the Clinton Foundation was instructed to spin off the Clinton Global Initiative placing strictures on Bill Clinton's ability to accept contributions from foreign governments. It appears that the Clinton's ignored the MOU with the recent revelations of Qatar's $1 million gift which went unreported. Thanks to Wikileaks, the DNC hack, Edward Snowden, Chelsea Manning and others, the internal workings of the US-Corporate State have been pried open to reveal a can of filthy worms entangled with each other in every which way. And not a damn thing will change no matter who runs the country. The American people, their constitution, Bill of Rights and ideals set forth in the Declaration of Independence are being tortured by opportunists. Besides that, they were written by ""white people"" back in the 1700's and so they hold no weight with large segments of the American citizenry. That, of course, plays right into the hands of the 'color of money' tech and financial interests who seek to eliminate the US nation-state leaving only the military, intelligence and the dollar's printing presses as backstops. No Win Situation In practice, all the well-intentioned federal legislation, tireless efforts of lobbyist watchdogs and anti-revolving door advocates had done little to inhibit much of the influence peddling undertaken by foreign agents and governments, US law firms, interest groups, trade associations, corporations and lobbying houses. Nor have their efforts slowed the speed of the revolving door though which officials who on one day are protecting and defending the Constitution of the United States emerge on the other side claiming fealty to a corporation's shareholders. The rules, regulations and procedures governing the process are not worth the paper they are printed on. The United States Supreme Court ruled that influence peddling by individuals or non-profit organizations are protected by the free-speech First Amendment to the Constitution of the United States. In 2010 the court's Citizens United v. Federal Election Commission extended that concept to for-profit associations, corporations and labor unions. Predictably, organizations and wealthy individuals have flooded the federal government and the 2016 election cycle with money. According to the public interest website Opensecrets.org--which tracks lobbying and revolving door activity--from 2008 to 2016 over $15 billion was spent by assorted organizations for US federal level influence peddling for all manner of issues ranging from defense and finance to sports and healthcare. The National Football League works hard at the local, state and federal levels for public funds to get their stadiums subsidized at the expense of taxpayers. In 2016 alone $1.6Bln was billed by lobbyists to their clients. In that same year 10,498 individuals and organizations registered as lobbyists. But even knowing how the system works, Americans see no alternative because they do not want to do the very difficult work of rebooting the system or holding their so called leaders accountable. A Look at AT&T, Time Warner Merger & Influence In October, the world's third largest telecommunications giant AT&T, a creature of the former Ma Bell System monopoly, offered cable and content provider Time Warner shareholders an $85 billion merger package. Both Boards of Directors gleefully approved the deal. Now that merger must receive the approval of the US Department of Justice and assorted state and federal regulatory bodies. If approved by regulators, the merger would create one the world's largest media conglomerates with one side of the monster, AT&T, very tight with the US National Security Agency. To increase the likelihood of success, AT&T, for its part, has mobilized some 100 lobbyists in Washington, DC, and scores more across the nation to cajole public utility, state legislatures and governors into supporting the merger. The company is already on the march in the US congress and at federal agencies like the Federal Communications Commission. Even the self-proclaimed titans in the US Congress who decry the influence of money in politics or swarms of lobbyists are on the dole. In 1999 Senator John McCain from the US state of Arizona and then Chairman of the Senate Commerce, Science and Transportation Committee, that oversees the telecommunications industry, introduced a bill that cleared the hurdles for the AT&T's acquisition of MediaOne Group making AT&T, at the time, the largest cable company in the United States, the Center for Public Integrity said in a report. ""His efforts did not go unrewarded: Two weeks after he introduced his bill, AT&T employees and their spouses contributed $10,000 to his presidential campaign in addition to $3,000 they gave him three days after AT&T announced its merger plans."" AT&T's federal influencers include revolving door types like former Senators John Breaux of Louisiana and Trent Lott of Mississippi who now work for heavyweight Washington, DC law-firm and influence house Squire, Patton and Boggs. AT&T will also apply pressure from its own Board of Directors, one of whom is former President Bill Clinton's chief economic advisor Laura D'Andrea Tyson. Coincidently she once served as a board member for Ameritech Corporation, formerly part of the AT&T-Bell System and now owned by AT&T. And how about this? The Board also includes the former Chairman of the US Federal Communications Commission from 1997 to 200, William Kennard. Inches or Sins? America is bankrupt and on the highway to hell. The outcome of the 2016 election will not halt that process unless the American people find a way out of the political, financial, cultural and military morass they and their leaders have created. There are two paths forward for Americans, it seems. The first is offered in dialogue from the movie SEVEN in which the serial killer John Doe (played by Kevin Spacey) innovatively murders seven people based on the Seven Deadly Sins. Sure, John's methods are unsound but the 'point' he makes about the sickness and tolerance levels of society are spot on. John Doe: ""A woman... so ugly on the inside she couldn't bear to go on living if she couldn't be beautiful on the outside. A drug dealer, a drug dealing pederast, actually! And let's not forget the disease-spreading whore! Only in a world this shitty could you even try to say these were innocent people and keep a straight face. But that's the point. We see a deadly sin on every street corner, in every home, and we tolerate it. We tolerate it because it's common, it's trivial. We tolerate it morning, noon, and night. Well, not anymore. I'm setting the example. What I've done is going to be puzzled over and studied and followed... forever.""The second path and a better alternative to John Doe's shock doctrine is from movie dialogue from Any Given Sunday in the famed inches speech by Coach D'Amato (played by Al Pacino). The football team has descended into the hell of cliques, internal clashes, off-field antics, and disagreements over play calling. No football team can be successful in such a situation. The team has to come together for some purpose. Americans face that challenge now. Coach D'Amato: ""Either we heal as a team or we're 'gonna' crumble inch by inch, play by play until we're finished. We're in hell right now, gentlemen...we can stay here, get the shit kicked out of us, or we can fight our way back into the light. We can climb 'outta' hell... one inch at a time. You see life's this game of inches, so is football. Because in either game - life or football - the margin for error is so small. I mean, one half a step too late or too early and you don't quite make it. One half second too slow, too fast and you don't quite catch it. I know if I'm 'gonna' have any life anymore it's because I'm still willing to fight and die for that inch, because that's what living is, the six inches in front of your face. The inches we need are everywhere around us. That's a team, gentlemen, and either we heal, now, as a team, or we will die as individuals. That's football guys, that's all it is.""

Banana Republic Election in the United States?,"Banana Republic Election in the United States? 07.11.2016 Print version Font Size Nothing is more hypocritical than to hear that the US government is going to send ""election observers"" to other countries. For nowhere on the planet are elections more easily rigged than in the United States of America. In ""Votescam: The Stealing of America"" (1992) the late Collier brothers summarized the alarming state of affairs, which still prevails today. In Chapter one, ""Electronic Hoodwink"", they begin by quoting the first words spoken by President-elect, George Bush in his Nov. 8, 1988 victory speech in Houston, Texas. Bush said: ""We can now speak the most majestic words a democracy can offer: ""The people have spoken . . . "" The Colliers comment in the following brilliantly written passage: ""It was not ""the People"" of the United States who did 'the speaking' on that election day, although most of them believed it was, and still believe it. In fact, the People did not speak at all. The voices most of us really heard that day were the voices of computers strong, loud, authoritative, unquestioned in their electronic finality . . . It only makes common sense that every gear, every mechanism, every nook and cranny of every part of the voting process ought to be in the sunlight, wide open to public view. How else can the public be reasonably assured that they are participating in an unrigged election where their vote actually means something? Yet one of the most mysterious, low-profile, covert, shadowy, questionable mechanisms of American democracy is the American vote count . . . Computers in voting machines are effectively immune from checking and rechecking. If they are fixed, you cannot know it, and you cannot be sure at all of an honest tally."" In fact, according to the Nation Magazine article published in August, 2005, ""How They Could Steal the Election This Time,"" by veteran reporter Ronnie Dugger, only four mega-election vendors, ES &S (Election Systems & Software), Hart, Diebold and Sequoia processed 96% of the USA vote on election night. Circa 2013, a company named Dominion acquired Diebold and Sequoia. Privately owned computer software And the processing of the nation's ballots are done, in 1988, in 2004, and in 2016, on secret, privately owned computer software which election officials in the USA agree by contract not to inspect. In other words, the vote in America is utterly unverifiable on these machines. America processes over eighty percent of the presidential vote on secret computer programs owned by only three mega-election vendors. This is at the very least an unholy concentration of power. If the three mega-vendors are working together behind the scenes, then it is the few that own this election software that selects the President. As Joseph Stalin said, ""Those who cast the votes decide nothing; those who count the votes decide everything."" This issue of computerized election fraud simmered sub rosa from 1988 until August 1, 2016, when Donald Trump stated at a Columbus, Ohio Rally that he was afraid the ""November election is going to be rigged against me."" The nation's national press went into a frenzy. Jonathan Chait screeched in his headline for nymag.com, ""Donald Trump, Discovering New Way to Undermine Democracy, Calls Election Rigged."" In fact, it was NOT the raising of healthy questions by Trump that was undermining democracy. It was so-called reporters like Chait who didn't like anyone raising any concerns at all. On C-Span on August 21, 2016, best-selling author Roger Stone asserted that is was dangerous NOT to ask questions about how the vote was counted. After all, the Founding Fathers did encourage a healthy skepticism of government, including the part of the government that runs the elections. The situation in the United States is absurd. The fact that the public has no guarantee that the vote is actually that of the people is insane, and tears at the very fabric of democracy. Press concern is so grave about Trump's charge of a possibly rigged election, that in the last two of the three Presidential debates, NBC's Lester Holt and FOX's Chris Wallace both asked Trump if he would accept the election results. In the third debate, Trump stunned Wallace by saying he'd wait and see after he looked at the evidence, and that he was going to keep everyone in suspense. No way votes can be verified Three Supreme Court cases stated that the US voter's right to vote consisted of two parts: 1) the right to cast a ballot; and 2) the right to KNOW that one's ballot is counted accurately. With secret computer counts, there is simply no way to verify the vote. None. This is the first major election in America where the people are learning just how compromised the computer based vote has become. On October 18, 2016, computer expert Ethan Pepper appeared on the Sean Hannity radio show and noted that any election computer can be hacked; that if you get in you can switch a million votes as easy as switching one vote; and he also raised the question of WHO owns the election computer software by noting that George Soros was closely associated with those who provided 16 states with the Smartamatic voting machines. This highlights the greatest danger: that the election vendors themselves OWN the election software and that THEY are the prime suspects for rigging elections. After all, they don't have to hack in, they ARE in as the programmers of the software. And with local election officials signing contracts not to inspect the source code of the computer software, these same election vendors know that no one is looking over their shoulder. On October 26th, FOX Cable News discussed the computer voting machines in Texas that were caught by numerous voters switching their Trump vote to a Hillary vote in early election voting. This phenomenon also surfaced in Maryland. Trump has tweeted and facebooked his 21 million followers on Twitter, Facebook, and Instagram about the computerized ""vote-flipping"" from Trump to Hillary in Texas. The issue of computerized election fraud was now planted in the public mind as a serious issue for the first time since election computers were introduced into the USA circa 1973. On October 31, 2016, the Drudge Report led with two links on how election computers were hacked. He linked to the new video by Bev Harris on youtube and on blackboxvoting.org entitled, ""Fraction Magic."" The Big TV Networks have been playing defense ever since. Rigging the election Every few hours one of the big Networks are running a story about how it would be almost ""impossible"" to rig a national election. But the networks had to report between airing these stories about a week ago that Ebay, Twitter, and the New York Times websites had been hacked, thus totally undermining their stories about the safety of election computers. The situation can be fixed in the USA, or prevented in other countries, by throwing the computer systems out altogether, and counting the paper ballots by hand, in public with all invited to observe, BEFORE the ballots leave the public sight. On November 5, 2016, FOX news carried commentary that whichever side wins in the Presidential race, the other will cry ""computer votefraud."" So the issue has finally become front and center in the Presidential campaign. Dr. David Dill of Stanford University is quoted in a 2004 Nation Magazine article, ""How They Could Steal the Election This Time"": ""Why am I always being asked to prove these systems aren't secure? The burden of proof ought to be on the vendor. You ask about the hardware. 'Secret.' The software? 'Secret.' What's the cryptography? 'Can't tell you because that'll compromise the secrecy of the machines.'... Federal testing procedures? 'Secret'! Results of the tests? 'Secret'! Basically we are required to have blind faith."" People of the USA act like citizens of Banana Republic Blind faith? That's what the subjects and slaves of Banana Republics and tin-horn dictatorships are reduced to. And that's what the people of the United States have now been reduced to since at least as far back as 1988, even though most Americans don't know it. 2016 has been a year of awakening on the election fraud issue. Will that awakening continue to grow so that the United States of America and all other nations? Will the United states and other nations replace easily-rigged election computers, and restore transparent, honest elections with hand-counted paper ballots at the neighborhood polling place once again? As it stands, there is absolutely no way to know who really won the upcoming presidential election in America. The power elite can rig their voting machines to whatever outcome they want. One of the ways the cabal in the United States can be stopped is by a verifiable vote where the America people can be assured they live in a democracy where their vote actually counts and that the will of the people is carried out in the elections.

How far can USA go to take revenge on Russia for 'cybercrimes?',"How far can USA go to take revenge on Russia for 'cybercrimes?' 07.11.2016 The United States continues an extremely aggressive campaign to accuse Russia of cyberattacks that may undermine confidence in the results of the US presidential election. US top officials have released quite a number of statements about possible responses to Russia that would at least create a stir inside the Kremlin. NBC has recently reportedб citing high-ranking sources in the US intelligence community, that US military hackers infiltrated the computer networks responsible for managing power supply and telecommunication systems of Russia. US hackers have reportedly gained access to ""Kremlin's networks"" and made them vulnerable to cyber attacks from the United States. Presidential press secretary Dmitry Peskov, commenting on the report, said that the security of Russian computer systems was ensured in accordance with current threats. The Russian Foreign Ministry demanded an official reaction from the United States in connection with the NBC report. Print version Font Size ""The absence of an official response from the US administration would speak for the existence of state cyber-terrorism   . Should the threats be implemented, Moscow will have a right to bring appropriate charges against Washington,"" official spokeswoman for the Russian Foreign Ministry Maria Zakharova said. It is worth noting that NBC plays a leading role in the campaign about the response from the USA to the attacks from hackers working for the Russian intelligence and the Kremlin."" In mid-October, US Vice President Joseph Biden told NBC about the elaboration of responsive measures against Russia. NBC later reported that the Obama administration was considering unprecedented covert operations against Russia in response to what US officials see as interference in the American presidential elections ."" Noteworthy, the head of NBC Universal Jeffrey Shell appears on Russia's list of sanctioned persons. However, the report said that the US administration was engaged in the process to collect certain documents to ""discredit"" the Russian leadership. In general, however, this is exactly what the US and Western media have been doing during the recent four years. Generally speaking, the subject of external interference in US elections is a new feature of American election campaigns. To which extent is Russia prepared to respond to Washington's threats? One may believe, of course, that all of this is simply a part of the election campaign. Yet, the subject of the ""Russian threat"" has become one of the central topics of Hillary Clinton's campaign. Will it continue developing if she takes offices as president? Washington Post columnist David Ignatius wrote, for example, that Obama allegedly personally warned Vladimir Putin about the inadmissibility of interference in the American elections. The Russians have supposedly taken the warnings. This is just an example of the implementation of political technology. This technology seems strange for Russia, but it lives very well in the USA. A lot has been done for the purpose, and it does not look like the project is going to end after November 8. InfoWatch CEO Natalya Kaspersky believes that Russia should take the threats from the USA seriously. ""Technically, such attacks are possible,"" she told Pravda.Ru. ""We have pretty good protection systems. Unfortunately, it is difficult for Russia to resist to the US technology, because basic infrastructure elements are of American origin. No matter what methods of protection we may apply to a particular system, we will not be able to go as deep as we need if the system is of American origin. It will be hard struggle,"" she noted. ""Of course, we would need to have Russian software and preferably hardware at basic infrastructure elements,"" said Natalya Kaspersky. The head of Safer Internet centre Mark Tverdynin said that NBC reports were ""exaggerated."" ""It is unlikely that someone has penetrated into our computer systems, because such attempts would be visible at once. If it had happened, our authorities would have reported about it. I think that Russia can show good resistance to such attacks. It appears to be a propaganda move,"" the expert told Pravda.Ru. ""Switching to domestic software and hardware is a must, of course, but it would require significant resources. We need to use the scientific and technical potential. This requires a priority attention, as this is a part of Russia's national defense,"" the expert added.

FBI Plan B fails: Clinton to be next president,"FBI Plan B fails: Clinton to be next president 07.11.2016 The FBI Director James Comey notified the US Congressmen that presidential nominee from the Democratic Party Hillary Clinton would not be prosecuted because of revelations connected with her e-mail. As Jason Chaffetz, chairman of the US House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform, reported, 'FBI Dir just informed us 'Based on our review, we have not changed our conclusions that we expressed in July with respect to Sec Clinton'. As Pravda.Ru reported, in late October the FBI Director James Comey announced that there were detected new e-mails of Clinton, which required additional investigations. The investigation got 'very high priority' level, and the FBI said that they had managed to gather a lot of evidence. Experts believe it indicates that Hillary Clinton will be the next president. It should be noted that corresponding is not the only trespass of Clinton. The US authorities always denied that monarchies of the Persian Gulf funded Jihadists, asserting that support came from rich donors of those countries. As it is evidenced in the e-mails of a member of the Clinton's campaign John Podesta, they lied. Moreover, it was found out that the US presidential candidate had created a weapons mafia for personal profit. Pravda.Ru",1
Kurds decide to get on US nerves,"Kurds decide to get on US nerves 07.11.2016 | Source: AP Photo Falah Bakir, Head of the Kurdistan Regional Government (in Iraq) Department of Foreign Relations, reported, that he had asked for military and humanitarian aid while meeting with the Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Mikhail Bogdanov. 'We asked for humanitarian aid to render support to refugees, that came to the Iraqi Kurdistan from other regions of the country, as well as from Syria,' Bakir said. The situation in the Kurdish area of Iraq has reached its critical point. Have they addressed someone else, or just Russia? Anton Mardasov, a military expert at the Institute of Innovative Development, head of the Department of the Middle Eastern conflicts , commented Pravda.Ru on the issue. The Iraqi Kurds had great relations with the Soviet Union , at the time Primakov headed the Kurdish direction. Masud Barzani (President of the Kurdish autonomy in Iraq)studied in the USSR. Thus, there are some ties. But any deliveries to the Iraqi Kurdistan require agreement with the central Iraqi government in Baghdad. For the moment it's not quite clear what the Kurds are asking for. It should be noted that there are several US military facilities in Kurdistan. What is more, huge oil industry is operating in the Iraqi Kurdistan, it means they do not have financial difficulties and can afford buying everything they need. Thus, I believe it's a political step. Maybe they'd like to get on the Americans' nerves. The situation is very difficult. So, we should cooperate and carry on a diplomatic and political dialogue, but real steps should be calculated very thoroughly. Pravda.Ru Read article on the Russian version of Pravda.Ru",1
Why NATO is put on war footing against Russia,"Why NATO is put on war footing against Russia 07.11.2016 Jens Stoltenberg claimed that given growing tensions in relations with Russia, hundreds of thousands of the NATO military men would be brought to higher level of readiness. Before that he stated that there's no danger and constructive relations with Moscow should be built. Now, according to him, the NATO authorities intend to prepare significant ground forces, which would be capable of containing 'Russian aggression'. What for are these acts?Andrey Koshkin, Ph.D. in Political Science:'First of all, it should be noted that we've caught the US at double standards in politics, and policy of the NATO military political alliance is the same. They react to Washington's order, which says that they should build-up potential, as Russian aggression is to be shown constantly. And how can it be shown? In order to show Russia's aggression, its own residents and armed forces should be shaken up. How can they be shaken up? Just switched to a more high level of readiness. That is what they are doing. If the Armed Forces are switched to a more high level of readiness, common residents of the Western states will react immediately. Yes, the danger is real if the Armed Forces are put on a war footing, and these are funds after all. The funds should be taken from taxpayers, that is why a new wave of anti-Russian hysteria has been set off in the mass media. Pravda.Ru",1
Russia outstrips USA in anti-meteorite defence,"Russia outstrips USA in anti-meteorite defence 07.11.2016 AP photo The US government has held exercises to simulate a collision of planet Earth with an asteroid up to 250 meters in diameter. The asteroid may supposedly ram into Earth on September 20, 2020. Pravda.Ru asked coordinator of Kosmopoisk public association, cryptophysicist, researcher and writer Vadim Chernobrov what means of protection against space bodies Russia had. ""The Americans often carry out large-scale and regional exercises, the legend of which is about meteorites. Russia should not be envious about such measures at all, because Russia holds similar exercises on a regular basis without advertising them. ""One of the most recent exercises was held in the Tyumen region. I have to say that the world's largest of such exercises was conducted in Russia in the first half of 2013, although the event had not received any coverage at all. The event was held soon after the fall of the Chelyabinsk meteorite. As we know, pieces of that space body started falling on Earth on February 10. The last pieces fell on 20 February - the process took ten days.

The legend of the exercises did not contain a word about the meteorite danger, but everyone knew that the event was connected with the fall of the Chelyabinsk meteorite . In fact, their goal was to show both the defence minister and the president, that our troops, if necessary, would be ready to go to any location in Russia and take all necessary measures in this regard."" Prior to 2050, as many as eleven asteroids may approach our planet at distances smaller than the average radius of the lunar orbit (385,000 kilometers).

Most Russians wan to ignore criticism from the West,"Most Russians wan to ignore criticism from the West 08.11.2016 | Source: AP photo One should not pay much attention to the criticism of Russia that comes from the West, more than half of Russians (59%) said in a recent opinion poll conducted by Levada Center, Interfax reports.The West perceives Russia as a competitor in an attempt to weaken the Russian Federation, 43% of respondents said. Thirty-five percent of respondents said that the criticism of the West was hostile. Every fourth (25%) respondent believes that Western critics often criticize Russia for what they should be criticized themselves . Every fifth respondent (21%) said that Europe and the US have little understanding of life in Russia, ""but they still want to teach us.""Critical remarks against Russia from Western countries are not worthy of attention, 30% of respondents said. The survey was conducted on October 21-24 among 1,600 people in 137 settlements of Russia.The majority of respondents 74% noted that the West wants to weaken and humiliate Russia by tightening sanctions against the country. According to 13 percent of respondent, the sanctions were imposed on Russia in an attempt to restore the geopolitical balance after Russia reunited with the Crimea.

Trump is USA's antique hero. Clinton will be next president,"Trump is USA's antique hero.

Earlier, however, the FBI had flagged Clinton's email case as a file of high priority. It was said that the FBI had collected a lot of evidence. All of a sudden, it was announced that Clinton would be cleared. Pravda.Ru asked political scientist and publicist Leonid Krutakov to comment on such a development. ""Was it a though-out move to show that Clinton is not guilty?"" ""Did you expect a criminal case against Clinton right before the election? I thought of such a plan if Trump were winning, but now that they have cleared her name, it means that Hillary Clinton will win the election. One can be sure for 100 percent that Hillary Clinton will be the next President of the United States of America. ""I do not think that the FBI Director made that decision independently. This is a political figure, this is a job to which people are appointed by someone else. It is stupid to believe that one FBI director will stand up against the whole elite that prints money and runs business and international politics. The times of ancient heroes have passed. Trump has tried to become one. He has proclaimed a new era, not only in America but in the world, and the electorate that has consolidated around Trump will not go anywhere after the election. ""One needs another war and another threat to America to make Trump's electorate change their mind. As we remember, George W. Bush won the election in no less controversial election battles, when votes in Florida were recounted manually.

Khodorkovsky: Putin is not going to cozy up to Washington,"Print version Font Size The number of predictions about the state of affairs in the US-Russian relations after the presidential election in the United States continues to grow. Former oligarch Mikhail Khodorkovsky did not stay aside and predicted that there would be nothing good in the US-Russian relations after the election, regardless of who wins the vote. If Hillary Clinton takes office as president, the relations between Russia and the United States will deteriorate further. According to the ex-oligarch, Putin was originally prepared for Clinton's victory in the election, therefore, he has been allegedly trying to damage the relations between the two countries during the recent months. The logic is as follows: ""He'd better to go down to the bottom so that she could make only one step - up."" ""If Mrs. Clinton wins, then the bottom that Putin sees will not be the real bottom. She knows how to hit Putin to make him fall even lower. She has an extensive experience, and she will not forgive - I'm talking about the American establishment here - she will not forgive interference in the internal electoral process in the United States,"" Mikhail Khodorkovsky, the head of Open Russia told Politico . When Khodorkovsky speaks about Clinton's ""extensive experience"" does he have Libya in mind? And of course, it is only Hillary Clinton, who knows all about the real bottom. If the Russian president was originally prepared for the victory of the former Secretary of State, then it is not clear why he would need to interfere in the ""internal electoral process."" Did he want to cause even greater damage to the US-Russian relations to give Clinton a chance to start it all over again? Or Putin? Or both? Why would he need to interfere, if she would not ""forgive?"" Noteworthy, on the eve of election day in the USA, former US ambassador to Russia Michael McFaul gave an interview to Russian media. McFaul stated in the interview that he did not think of Hillary Clinton as a supporter of a hard line course against Russia.""I think the claim that the fear-mongering that Trump himself and Trump supports say to scare American voters that Secretary Clinton is going to start a war with Russia is completely absurd, completely has nothing to do with the reality. Only a total crazy person would start a war with Russia,"" McFaul told Interfax . Clinton understands that there will be no war between the U.S. and Russia, ""she is not crazy,"" he added. ""I think she takes a very pragmatic approach to defend America's national interests and security and economic interests of our allies,"" McFaul said. ""She's not going to become president to say ""it is my goal to improve relations with Russia"". What is she's going to do instead is she is going to say that ""it is my goal with Russia to accomplish policy items A, B and C."" And then she is going to decide which strategy, which instrument of policy [will achieve that]. Sometimes it will be engagement and sometimes [it will] be containment,"" Michael McFaul said, Interfax reports. Unlike the former ambassador, Mikhail Khodorkovsky does not leave Hillary Clinton any room for maneuver. What if Donald Trump leaves? There will not be anything good for Russia anyway, Khodorkovsky believes. A conflict between the two countries will be highly likely as well, because Putin is not going to cozy up to Washington. ""We all know people like Trump, and it is unlikely that Putin will play up to Trump's ambition, like, for example, Kadyrov (Chechen President - ed.) plays up to Putin's ambition,"" Khodorkovsky said.What does Kadyrov got to do with it? Is it just because his name rings the bell in the West? According to Khodorkovsky, it is difficult to predict what will happen after Putin refuses to subordinate Russia to Trump's will. ""Putin will not be able to do this, so it means that a conflict with Trump is inevitable.""Why is the ex-oligarch confident that the Republican candidate will wish to subjugate Russia? What does he know about Trump's thoughts on Russia? Does Khodorkovsky know something that everyone else does not know? The former oligarch does not expect anything positive in relations between Russia and the United States, and it seems that this is the most desirable option for him. Anton Kulikov",1
Truth about Mosul to emerge at mass funerals,"Truth about Mosul to emerge at mass funerals 08.11.2016 AP Photo Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, leader of the IS terror group, has fled from Mosul, as the Iraqi army reported. Intelligence sources have also confirmed information about escape of the head of terrorists, who was allegedly leaving the city among its residents to cover himself against airstrikes. The data was confirmed by the Western intelligence services as well. However, before that al-Baghdadi published an audio where he called to stay in the city and fight, opposing with all the possible means without regard to own lives. Beside that, the warlord threatened Turkey, calling this country to be a new field for ISIS. Anatoliy Tsyganok, head of the Centre for Military Prognosis , commented Pravda.Ru on the events. Can this information be trusted? I have serious doubts. First of all, because there is a so-called terror military leadership, 24 people were deliberately chosen for this purpose. Seven of them had been imprisoned in Guantanamo, others - in the Iranian prisons. This situation is a fake. Print version Font Size Mosul is really being bombed now. If the situation is compared with that in Aleppo, it should be noted that there are just some 200-250 civilians in Aleppo and humanitarian corridors operate there. While in Mosul the number of civilians reaches a million and a half, and there are no humanitarian corridors at all. In Aleppo there are journalists, and there are none of them in Mosul. Information which comes from the Americans is quite negative. And one will be able to check it only after mass funeral in Mosul. How will events in Mosul be developing? What will Turkey face? The Americans always compare today military acts with those when they were fighting in Iraq before, when six out of eight Iraqi corps just surrendered, because generals were bribed. And creating ISIS, they decided that they knew its military authorities. I doubt that they will manage to bribe them. And the idea itself to take Mosul by 8 November is crazy. One should understand clearly that fighters prepared defence in a very clever way . Moreover, they built 2-3km long catacombs. We've evidenced may times when they were attacking at one place, and exited at another. The Islamic State fighters will oppose, I have no doubts. And it will be a long-lasting process. And what about Turkey? It's very interesting. Note that three years ago they wanted to dethrone Bashar al-Assad, then after reconciliation with Moscow they changed their stance. Motivation is very simple. First of all, some power should be present in Syria. And the opposition cannot decide who will be the president. While for the president it's also quite hard to rely on the opposition. What is more, if speaking about the Turkish authorities. What are they doing? Certainly they may be trying to make use of the situation to take some lands from the Syrian government. But it's an old story. Second, they want to take territory which is defended by Kurds. And in this case the Turkish government gets into a conflict with the Americans, who said 15 years ago that they would create a Kurdish state. In fact, they have created it in the territory of Iraq. Thus, given it, the Turks will fight, but not for Mosul . Beside that, when Americans say that they are allegedly legitimate and backed by countries, its is also an insanity. That is only Russia which is at request of Damascus in Syria, and the Americans have been deployed here illegally. I believe countries which fight in Aleppo have their own goals, which do nor correspond with those of Bashar al Assad's government, the Kremlin or Turkey's government. What is going on in Syria may create a certain configuration of military and diplomatic forces in two or three years. The war in Syria has been on for almost 15 years, but talks about it were started just 5 years ago. Norwegian experts found oil fields in Syria, which according to their estimations surpass all the fields of Qatar . That is, war is going on for oil. Six years ago the US president said an interesting thing: he would interfere in situation in the Middle East to bring order under the US scenario, and so that there's no possibility to deliver oil reserves. Namely this is the main task of the US in the region. Pravda.Ru Read article on the Russian version of Pravda.Ru",1
"James Comey to be taken out, knows too much about Clintons","James Comey to be taken out, knows too much about Clintons 08.11.2016 | Source: AP Photo James Comey, Director of the FBI, can be sacked for a 'thoughtless step' - intrusion into elections. Valerie Jarrett, Obama's adviser, managed to convince him of necessity to undertake such a step, Daily Mail reported with a reference to a source in the White House. At the same time, other sources assert that Comey himself is ready to resign, not waiting for Obama's decision. In the FBI many believe that the Director has prejudiced reputation of the bureau and lost his weight among employees . Reopening of investigation against the presidential candidate Hillary Clinton 'for no apparent reason' and spontaneous closure of the case... Isn't Comey though a political figure? Could he have initiated everything by himself? Viktor Olevich, a political analyst , has commented Pravda.Ru on the issue. James Comes is a high-ranking political manager in the American system. He has long-standing relationship with the Republican party, he has been its adherent for several decades. He was taking various stances, which correlated with the Republican party's policies, including that regarding a conflict between the US law-enforcement and Afro-American community, where his stance was closer to the Rights than the current Administration of the White House. Head of the FBI took part in a corruption investigation regarding Bill Clinton in the early-2000, when a multimillionaire Marc Rich was pardoned by the president Bill Clinton. As a result of the investigation, the former president was not prosecuted. Nonetheless, Comey's attitude to Clintons is still quite suspect, negative. It's not by chance that last Friday, 11 days before elections, investigation was renewed by decision of the FBI Director. Moreover, a dossier on that investigation of Clinton's corrupt activity - Jams Comey carried out 15 years ago - was leaked via the FBI Twitter account. These are absolutely interrelated events. In such way, Comey tried to pressurize Clinton's campaign. However, just two days ago Comey announced that the new investigation was stopped. It's clear that certain negotiations between Comey's bureau and other parts of the US establishment took place. Those talks resulted in the fact that a case on potential disclosure of a state secret while using a private server when Hillary Clinton was a State Secretary, was closed yer again. It's no surprise that Obama's Administration is going to get rid of unwanted head of the FBI and substitute him for a person that will be favourable for new administration of Hillary Clinton, as she will evidently win today.

FBI Director may be sacked for intrusion into elections,"FBI Director may be sacked for intrusion into elections 08.11.2016 James Comey, Director of the FBI, can be sacked in the nearest future because of a thoughtless step - 'intrusion into elections'. As the British Daily Mail reported with a reference to a source in the White House, it was Obama's adviser Valerie Jarrett who convinced him of necessity to undertake such a step. Head of the FBI alienated both Democrats and Republicans. Thus, the Congress will support the leaving president in this issue. Obama has already discussed with Jarrett all the possible legal and political consequences of such decision. At the same time, other sources assert that Comey himself is ready to resign, not waiting for Obama's decision. In the FBI they believe that the Director has prejudiced reputation of the bureau and lost his weight among employees . Reopening of investigation against the presidential candidate Hillary Clinton 'for no apparent reason ' and further closure of the case without consulting with experts have concerned law-enforcement as well as prosecutors.

Russia's countersanctions for Syria will hit the West below the belt,"Russia's countersanctions for Syria will hit the West below the belt 08.11.2016 Print version Font Size The West and Russia are entering the third year of the war of sanctions . Washington threatens to impose new sanctions against Russia, this time for Syria. Russia will take ""painful measures"" in response, Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov said. Pravda.Ru offers the list of counter sanctions that we made up on the basis of experts' opinions. 1. Russia's first answer would be the abolition of neo-liberal economic policies and transition to a new economic development strategy . This will block channels of Western influence on our country and thus become the most asymmetric, but a tough answer to Western sanctions, said Ruslan Dzarasov, Doctor of Economics, head of the department of political economy at the Russian Economic University named after Plekhanov.The expert noted that ""we continue to adhere to the export growth model, taking capital to the West and forming the budget on the basis of financial interests of capital rather than domestic consumers."" Russia, the expert said, should introduce a combination of state planning and market sector, ""similar to what the USSR was doing during the 1920s .""""The state should ensure the financial transparency of corporations, expand the rights of trade unions and workers, strengthen social control over big business, show influence on the formation prices in economy to eliminate price disparity in favor of the mining export sector to the detriment of the manufacturing industry,"" Ruslan Dzarasov told Pravda.Ru.2. Russia could refuse from saving its reserves in US dollars . Russia does not take the first place in terms of dollar savings in the world, but it could still cause a serious blow on the Western financial system, Valentin Katasonov, Doctor of Economics, Professor at the Moscow State Institute of International Finance, the head of Russian Economic Society named after S.F. Sharapov, told Pravda.Ru.""A lot of Russia's liabilities in national gold and currency reserves are nominated in US dollars. Should they are put on the market, the US dollar will suffer greatly ,"" leading expert at the Union of Oil and Gas Industrialists, Rustam Tankan said. Noteworthy, some privately run Russian companies already abandon the US dollar in their activities. Megafon, one of Russia's three leading cellular providers, converted about 40 percent of dollar deposits in euros and Hong Kong dollars. The company transferred the funds to accounts in major Chinese banks. Norilsk Nickel took similar measures. The Hong Kong dollar is a Chinese foreign clone of the dollar, and the USA is unable to impose any sanctions on this currency . Russia has started abandoning from the US dollar as a reserve currency by opening the Raw Materials Exchange of St. Petersburg, where Russian energy carriers are traded in rubles. 3. Russia could freeze assets of US investors in the Russian economy . ""Foreign citizens are the ultimate beneficiaries of our shadow holdings. There are tricky financial mechanisms in the timber industry, for instance,"" Igor Gerasimov, member of the Committee for Business Security at the Chamber of Commerce, security expert, told Pravda.Ru. The shadow mechanism works as follows. A wood-working company does most of the work, while most of the profit goes to a ""general contractor."" The latter pays the company a relative price for production, plus a minimum profit. Most of the profit goes to specific individuals, to accounts of foreign companies. Therefore, Russia could adopt laws about the nationalization of natural resources and city-forming enterprises, said Igor Gerasimov.4. The State Duma of the Russian Federation has already discussed a draft law to relieve state-run and privately-owned Russian companies from debts totaling $700 billion . These debts are held by Western banks of the countries that threatened to impose sanctions against Russia.5. Sanctions in the field of high technology will be no less sensitive. ""Russian titanium will cease to arrive at European companies, and this will certainly be a very significant act of pressure on our partners,"" Alexei Mukhin, general director of the Center for Political Information told Pravda.Ru. Boeing and United Technologies, as well as Europe's Airbus Group, purchase most of their titanium from Avisma, a Russian company, which happens to be the world's largest titanium producer . Yet, it goes about only 30 percent of needs. The USA remains entirely dependent on Russia in the field of rocket engines . RD-180 is a six-ton ​​liquid rocket engine with a thrust of more than 400 tons. The USA has been using Russian rocket engines since 2000. US Congress passed the budget, which provided for the allocation of hundreds of millions of dollars to purchase an ""unlimited"" number of RD-180 rocket engines. 6. Russia's sanctions against Western airlines would lead to their elimination . A great deal of airlines fly across the territory of Russia and save a lot of money on this, chairman of the Federation Council Committee on International Affairs, Andrei Klimov, told Pravda.Ru.""If all of a sudden, the Russian authorities try to do something in this field, it will generate huge profits to companies from such countries as the United Arab Emirates, but at the same time it will cause serious financial damage to German, French and other air carriers,"" - said the expert.7. Many large companies in the West have a strong lobby in legislative authorities. Therefore, the input of targeted sanctions under the pretext of violation of rules and regulations would be a very strong response . Starting from 1 November 2016, Russia banned imports of salt from the EU, the US, Canada, Australia, Iceland, Liechtenstein, Montenegro, Albania and Ukraine. On February 15, 2016 Russia banned imports of soybeans and corn from the United States, including through third countries. Russia still imports various food products from the United States, spending millions of dollars a year (PepsiCo, Starbucks, Cargill, McDonald's), pharmaceuticals (Pfizer), cosmetic products (Procter & Gamble, Johnson & Johnson), plastics, machinery, textiles, footwear, automobiles (Ford, General Motors) as well as products under the ""secret code"" worth $554 million in the first half of 2016.

Information that Lord Malloch-Brown, Director General of a company which produces election technology and voting machine, has close partnership relations with global fraudster and speculator George Soros, occurred in the US media in mid-October. And it was the last straw for the Americans. It's also confirmed implicitly by the fact that Soros himself has stood for Hillary Clinton many times. A famous financier of colour revolutions makes everything possible not to let Donald Trump come to power, as the latter has claimed several times that in case he won, he would cease policy of 'implanting democracy' in other countries. Taking into account sorrowful experience of the Soros' structures in the post-Soviet countries as well as those in the Central and Eastern Europe, these relations really allow to seriously suspect the financier and sponsor of colour revolutions of attempts to influence unbiased will of the American citizens.

Ukraine remains in a state of shock as well as the Ukrainian administration was hoping for Clinton's support in the struggle against Russia. Print version Font Size To be honest, no one was expecting Donald Trump to win. It is worth recalling that from the start of the presidential campaign, everyone saw Trump as a clown and an absolute outsider of the campaign, while Hillary Clinton was seen as the leader. This years' presidential election in the United States has been, perhaps, the ""dirtiest"" and most scandalous election from the point of view of all the compromising materials that the candidates had to face in their campaigns. At some point, the leaders of the Republican Party were opposed to their own candidate. So why Trump? If one looks at recent polls by Gallup Foundation and other institutions of political sociology, one can see a huge percentage of ordinary Americans who do not trust both the election procedure and the existing political elites in both the Republican and the Democratic Party. According to the majority of US citizens, federal politicians do not represent the interests of the people - they represent the interests of certain corporations. Most importantly, many Americans understand that this is a system that they live in. Donald Trump with his slogan ""Make America Great Again!"" is a jack-of-the-box, who is not associated with all this party and, more broadly, backstage responsibility that has been blooming on Capitol Hill for many years. Hillary Clinton, is an old paralytic witch, whose laughter makes one shudder, but she carries the function of an appendage of American multinational corporations in politics. Donald Trump and his simple and somewhere populist decisions has challenged to revise both domestic and foreign politics of the United States. He has questioned the USA's membership in NATO and the funding of multiple US bases all over the world. Trump wants to give up on all that and use the money for the USA, and this is what US tax-payers are looking forward to. Common Americans are fed up with ideas of world hegemony and international confrontation. The American people are tired of corruption and excessive spending on the maintenance of their exceptional status. Donald Trump has promised to change all this. Donald Trump is indeed unpredictable in both negative and positive terms because he has never worked in any forms of the US government. He has zero experience in international affairs, which makes him an absolutely unpredictable persona, journalist Vladimir Poznerб a US citizen, believes. Democrats should have listened to what the people were saying. There were many petitions on the website of the White House to withdraw the Magnitsky Act, lift sanctions against Russia and revise USA's relations with the Russian Federation. What did the Democrats do? They deleted those petitions and reset website vote counters. Will the new USA try to improve the relations with Russia? Here is what Trump said about Russia a while ago: ""I had a major event in Russia two or three years ago, which was a big, big incredible event. ""And you know what?"" he continued. ""They want to be friendly with the United States. Wouldn't it be nice if we actually got along with somebody?"" The US-Russian relations appear to be just a tiny part of the visible displeasure of American voters with the US political system. One can recall Al Gore, who received the majority of votes of citizens, but a minority of votes of electors. George W. Bush took office as president, but the American society did not have the degree of discontent and tension that one can see now. If the ""Gore scenario"" reoccur, America will face mass riots. Ordinary people are tired of the policy that had been formed in the USA after the Cold War. The US expert community that called Trump an absolute outsider, admit their defeat. Sociologist and professor at Princeton University, Sam Wang, said that the entire (sociological) industry has failed in the presidential election in the United States. Other experts have found a cause for Trump's triumph. Michael McFaul, former US Ambassador to Russia, tweeted: ""Putin intervened in our elections and succeeded. Well done"". There were no Russian observers in the US election. Suffice it to recall Putin's remarks about the banana country: ""Does anyone really think that Russia could influence the American people's choice in any way? The number of mythical, dreamt-up problems include the hysteria - I can't think of another word - that has broken out in the United States about the influence of Russia on the current elections for the US president. What, is America a banana republic?!,"" Putin said. ""Correct me if I am wrong. America is a great power,"" Putin said. The US expertocracy, as well as party policy-makers have long ceased to regard the American society as a standalone entity policy. Rather, they see the American society as a mass of people that one can easily manipulate with. Roughly speaking, the development of American democracy has led to the formation of a decorative role for the society. Yet, as we can now see, propaganda and manipulations do not have the last say, not even in the USA. British experts had also excluded the victory of the Brexit vote. They did not even believe that UK citizens would vote to leave the EU. They also hoped for mass manipulations and media propaganda. In general, Donald Trump has managed to grow into a universal, popular candidate. Who knows, maybe he will make America great without destroying the whole world for the purpose. Will he be change that Barack Obama failed to bring to life? Politonline",1

Donald Trump will be the new President of the United States of America. The Republican won 276 electoral votes with the necessary minimum of 270 votes and he has made himself to the post of the head of the United States. 
Pravda.Ru has turned for a comment to Paul Craig Roberts who is an American economist, journalist, blogger and former civil servant. 
The US presidential election is historic, because the American people were able to defeat the oligarchs. Hillary Clinton, an agent for the oligarchy, was defeated despite the vicious media campaign against Donald Trump. This shows that both the political establishment of both political parties and the media no longer have credibility with the American people.It remains to be seen whether Trump can select and appoint a government that will serve him and his goals to restore American jobs and to establish friendly and respectful relations with Russia, China, Syria, and Iran.It also remains to be seen how the oligarchy will respond to Trump's victory. Wall Street and its agent, the Federal Reserve, can cause an economic crisis in order to put Trump on the defensive. Rogue agents in the CIA and Pentagon can cause a false flag attack that would disrupt friendly relations with Russia. Trump could make a mistake and retain neoconservatives in his government.With Trump there is at least hope. Unless Trump is obstructed by bad judgment and obstacles put in his way, we should expect an end to Washington's orchestrated conflict with Russia, the removal of the US missiles on Russia's border with Poland and Romania, the end of the conflict in Ukraine, and the end ofWashington's effort to overthrow the Syrian government. However, achievements such as these implythe total defeat of the oligarchy. Although Trump defeated Hillary, the oligarchy still exists and is stillpowerful.Trump said that he no longer sees the point of NATO 25 years after the Soviet collapse. If he sticks tohis view, it means a big political change in Washington's EU vassals. The hostility toward Russia ofthe current EU and NATO officials would have to cease.We do not know who Trump will select to serve in his government. It is likely that Trump is unfamiliarwith the various possibilities and their positions on issues. It really depends on who is advising Trump and what advice they give him. Once we see his government, we will know whether we can be hopefulfor the changes that now have a chance. If Trump is actually successful in curbing the power and budget of the military/security complex and in holding Wall Street politically accountable, he could be assassinated.

Trump victory: A new political awakening,"Trump victory: A new political awakening 09.11.2016 Donald Trump's historic Challenge victory over Hillary Clinton's Establishment saw another law being written in the modern geopolitical rule book in a world where globalization has marginalized millions, for whom ""change"" can only mean something better. Trump translates as businesslike pragmatism... Donald Trump won a brilliant victory over Hillary Clinton for one clear reason: because he adoped a businesslike and pragmatic approach, directing his message at his target, dealing the cards throughout the game and delivering what people wanted to hear. The target Around a quarter of the electorate in the United States of America live on under one thousand USD per month; a substantial slice of the electorate is one paycheck away from the street. Globalization has meant little for these people, other than fewer jobs, as factories relocate abroad to the Philippines and as Filipinos come home to work for less and to drive down wages. Donald Trump understood the discourse of America's blue-collar workers and on election day, they turned out en masse . The opinion polls Print version Font Size However, the Trump vote was also an anti-establishment one and this was the magical hidden number of voters who eluded the election pundits and opinion poll makers. Those who regard the Establishment as having failed them participate neither in re-electing the Establishment, nor in participating in any of its mechanisms, including opinion polls, so these cannot take into account a growing percentage of the population and this by far exceeds the three per cent margin of error the pundits work with. Today, the opinion polls have become meaningless. Dealing the cards Throughout the campaign, Donald Trump appealed as the dealer even on polemical issues. The Mexican Wall had Hillary supporters crying blue murder and had the Mexican President jumping up and down as the world media buzzed. But Trump dealt the card. Ditto women's rights, immigration, Moslems, terrorists in America's communities and all other sexy soundbites from start to finish. Trump was out there, sometimes visiting five States a day while Hillary Clinton became famous for her prolonged absences. Delivering what people wanted to hear Clinton, as the Establishment candidate, could only offer more of the same (how can you speak about ""change"" when you have been part of the system for three decades and how much change did Obama deliver?) Trump, as the Challenger, played his role to perfection, attacking the system, promising much more in terms of jobs, working conditions and prosperity. Foreign policy Again, Trump has been making the sounds of a businessman and a pragmatist in relation to foreign policy. A businessman likes a level playing field, a businessman likes to set and know and play by the rules, clear rules, a businessman has values, a businessman respects his partners and tries to get along with them. This, if the Trump presidency is not hijacked by a cabal of lobbies, if Trump himself is not neutered, or worse, will dictate a businesslike and fresh start for the international community. Conclusion Hillary Clinton's embodiment of the Establishment, as an insider, saw her regarded as being out of touch in the corridors of power. The allegations surrounding the way the Clinton Foundation was perceived as a mechanism to facilitate favors in return for donations did nothing to further her cause and the arrogance with which she and the Democrats conducted policy, such as the interference in Ukraine, such as her giggling fit when told that terrorists had murdered Gaddafi, such as the continuation of the policy of siding with terrorists in Syria, served her political epitaph in this election and placed a heavy tombstone on her career. In a word, Hillary ""almost"" Clinton. For Trump, with both Houses in his favor, the cards are stacked for him to start dealing. I repeat, if the lobbies do not neuter him, or worse, he may be the best dealer the USA has had for many decades. And time will tell. Donald Trump may be out of the box but he is not out of his mind.

Saakashvili reveals age-long friendship with Trump,"Saakashvili reveals age-long friendship with Trump 10.11.2016 Mikheil Saakashvili reported that he had known Donald Trump for many years, was a friend of him and called to be careful. As he wrote on his Facebook, 'I've known him for over 20 years, we are friends. I predicted this cautiously. It's a strong personality with unpredictable policy. We should be more careful and organized than ever'.Donald Trump has won the US presidential elections. Mikheil Saakashvili was a president himself in Georgia. And resigned as a Governor of the Odessa region the other day. It should be recollected that the Ukrainian authorities tried to help the Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton at these elections. In summer the Ukrainian Anti-Corruption Bureau opened investigation against ex-chairman of Trump's presidential campaign Paul Manafort who had allegedly got some millions dollars from former ruling Party of Regions. Petro Poroshenko in his turn hoped that whoever came to power in the US after elections, Kiev would still get support.Poroshenko's Administration also sent a request for a meeting with Trump at the UN General Assembly during Poroshenko's being in New York. However, Trump's representatives ignored the request. Pravda.Ru",1
Trump’s success shocks global markets,"Trump’s success shocks global markets 10.11.2016 Victory of Donald Trump at the US presidential elections has shaken up global markets, which staked on the Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton.

How to Survive Being Lost in the Woods: Tips & Tricks that May Save Your life – 11/17/16,"Posted by Devin Peterson on 11/16/2016 to Outdoor Survival Many of us head out into the woods or the wilderness to “lose ourselves” in the beauty of Mother Nature, but this stops being fun and can become horrible if we are unlucky enough to actually get lost while out there. You might not think it can happen to you, but even the best, most experienced hikers get lost. There are loads of things to consider once you realize you are lost and it is helpful to have an action plan in case it ever happens to you. We’ve come up with a list of questions you should ask yourself once you determine you are in fact lost to try and help you take control of the situation. This is a good way to start, but to get a full idea of what you need to know check out this complete guide of how to survive being lost in the woods . 1. Can I get help? 
Once you have admitted to yourself that you are lost one of the first things you want to consider is how you are going to get help. Here’s a few ways that you could do this, some more obvious than others. Check your cell phone - obviously if you have service and can reach either a friend or can call 9/11, this situation is going to be much easier. Stay in the area and yell - you never know who might be in the area or how close to a trail you might be. Stick around in the same spot and shout at the top of your lungs for help. If someone is in the area, they’ll come find you. Make a fire - if you are in an area where it might be hard to find you, try to make a small fire using heavier, smokier woods. This could alert someone to your presence and could direct anyone looking for you to where you are. 2. What time is it? 
Now that you have tried a few things to try and get help, you need to assess the situation and the time of day that it is will play a huge role in what you decide to do next. Depending on what your clock says you can: Begin looking for a place to camp Retrace your steps Rest until it gets cooler Have an idea of which way is East and which way is West. 
The idea of using the sun to help you orient yourself is useful, but obviously depends on you knowing where it is you are headed. You may think East is the way back, but if you are already East of where you started this could be dangerous. Also, the sun is actually very rarely aligned perfectly with East and West. This could be helpful in some situations, but be careful basing major decisions on this information. 3. Do I have enough water? 
No matter if you have enough time to try and find your way back to where you came or if you have decided to make camp, you are going to need water. Also, since you are now lost, it is important that you ration the water you do have until you find a new source. If you decide to walk around looking for where you came from, you are going to get thirsty and want to drink, which will deplete your supply. If you can find a water supply, stick to it and start thinking about how you can purify it to make sure it is safe to drink. Here are some of the most effective ways: Boil the water - this is relatively easy and safe to do, but it might be difficult if you are not carrying a pot or some other receptacle to hold the water Make a filter - you can make a filter using rocks and leaves and any burnt wood you might be able to find. This is not the cleanest way to do this, but could be effective in desperate situations Use chemicals - if you are a prepared hiker you might be carrying some iodine or chlorine with you that you can drop into the water you collect in order to make sure it is clean. If you don’t have this, see the first two options. 
If it is impossible to do any of these, the only thing left to do is to look for a running stream and chance drinking out of it. This is risky and not recommended, but if you really need water you may not have any other choice. If you can’t find a stream you could use one of the following water collection techniques: Collect condensation from trees with plastic bags Collect rain water with a shirt or a towel Neither of these is ideal, but desperate times call for desperate measures. 4. Where can I get food? 
If you are not carrying any food with you or it looks like you are going to be on your own for a while, you are going to need to figure out where your food is going to come from. If you are near a lake or a pond or in an area with wildlife, you could try to be inventive and fashion a fishing pole or a spear out of some branches to try and get food. However, if the area you’re in doesn’t allow for this or you’re not handy enough, there are some plants easily found that can be eaten that offer nutrients for emergency situations. Here are a few: Pine needles - sounds weird, but they are full of Vitamin C, especially the light green parts that come out in Spring Dandelion leaves - they taste quite bitter, but are full of iron and will help you maintain your energy level Elder weed - legend has it that the Roman army helped feed itself on this plant while out campaigning. It’s got lots of nutrients and can be found anywhere. 
When you have to resort to eating in the woods, just be careful. The most harmless looking berry can be poisonous. You should be okay, but play it safe. Hopefully you never need this 
It is good information to have in case you ever are lost in the woods, but hopefully proper preparation and practicing safe hiking techniques will mean you will never have to ask yourself the questions we’ve discussed. Having said that, do you have any experience surviving in the woods? Let us know what you did to stay alive, but again, let’s hope it doesn’t happen.",1

PUTIN ISSUES INTERNATIONAL ARREST WARRANT FOR GEORGE SOROS … DEAD OR ALIVE,"Share on Facebook Share 
Russia have officially declared that Billionaire George Soros is a wanted man in their country, citing him and his organizations as a “threat to Russian national security”. 
Putin banned Soros from Russia last year due to the fact that Soros helped to nearly destroy the Russian economy in the early 1990’s. 
Veteranstoday.com reports: 
Matt Taibbi of the Rolling Stone said of Goldman Sachs six years ago: 
“The first thing you need to know about Goldman Sachs is that it’s everywhere. The world’s most powerful investment bank is a great vampire squid wrapped around the face of humanity, relentlessly jamming its blood funnel into anything that smells like money. 
“In fact, the history of the recent financial crisis, which doubles as a history of the rapid decline and fall of the suddenly swindled dry American empire, reads like a Who’s Who of Goldman Sachs graduates.” 
Obviously Soros wants to be like Goldman Sachs. Phil Butler puts it well when he says: “George Soros has a finger in every political pie there is. If there is a crisis on our world, it’s a safe bet he’s had a hand in it.” 
One can say that Soros and Goldman Sachs are ideologically part of the same brotherhood. Their strategy is a little different, but the end result is the destruction of lives via the economic system (be it capitalism or socialism) and political manipulation. 
That’s why Soros seems to think that he is invincible. He thinks he can move the political and economic planet in a few blinks of an eye and no one can tell him to stop. In fact, he writes books such as The Alchemy of Finance. Soros thinks he can kill political stability throughout Europe and indeed in America with no challenge. 
Soros is certainly old, but he doesn’t want to be obsolete. His organization has recently been caught conducting covert operations designed to destabilize Russia. Here is an interesting quote from the leaked files of Soros’ Open Society Foundation: 
“Our inclination is to engage in activities and with actors that will understand and counter Russian support to movements defending traditional values…Naming and shaming from us is problematic: we are also in the business of channeling money into other countries for political purposes.” ",1
"Tens of thousands march for, against Venezuela government","This handout picture released by the Venezuelan Presidency shows supporters of Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro cheering during a gathering in Caracas on October 26, 2016. (Photo by AFP) 
Tens of thousands of pro and anti-government protesters have gathered on the streets of Venezuela's capital Caracas. 
During Wednesday’s mass rallies, in which over 20 people were injured and 39 were detained, the opponents accused President Nicolas Maduro of violating the constitutional order and blocking a recall referendum aimed at removing him from power. 
They also called for his immediate resignation. Opposition supporters take part in a rally against Venezuela's President Nicolas Maduro next to a poster of him in Caracas, Venezuela, October 26, 2016. (Photo by Reuters) 
“This is a way of pressuring Maduro so he understands that he has to go,"" said one protester. ""Being passive is no use anymore. We have to apply more pressure,"" another one added. 
Meanwhile, large numbers of pro-government protesters gathered near the Miraflores presidential palace in a show of support for Maduro. 
As the protests were being held, the president engaged in crisis security talks in reaction to the demonstrators’ demands. In a televised speech after the talks, he called for ""political dialogue and peace in Venezuela.""

Maduro is adamant about Washington's role in his country’s political and economic woes, and has accused the opposition of conspiring with the US against the South American country. 
""They are desperate, they have received the order from the north to destroy the Venezuelan revolution,"" he added. 
On Tuesday, Maduro accused the opposition of attempting a “parliamentary coup” by voting to launch an impeachment process against him. 
“There has never been a parliamentary coup in Venezuela, and we shall not allow anything like this to happen, the right-wing here and there should know this,” Maduro said during a massive rally by his supporters outside the presidential palace.

The opposition-controlled National Assembly agreed to initiate the impeachment process against Maduro earlier on Tuesday in reaction to blocking a bid to recall him last week. 
The political standoff in Venezuela has worsened since the October 20 suspension of the opposition push to hold a referendum to try to recall Maduro. Back then, four state courts said the signature-gathering process for the referendum had been “fraudulent,” effectively blocking it. Loading ...",1

PressTV-Hezbollah shares Aoun’s victory: Lebanon FM,"Lebanon Lebanese Foreign Minister Gebran Bassil gestures to his supporters during a rally to show support for FPM founder Michel Aoun, near the presidential palace in Baabda, near Beirut, Lebanon, October 16, 2016. (Photo by Reuters) 
Lebanon’s Minister of Foreign Affairs Gebran Bassil says the Lebanese resistance movement Hezbollah shares the victory of Michel Aoun in securing the country’s presidency. 
Aoun, a strong Hezbollah ally, was chosen by Lebanese lawmakers as the country’s president on Monday. 
Addressing a large number of people who had converged at a square in Beirut to celebrate Aoun’s election, Bassil, who is also the head of the Free Patriotic Movement (FPM) and Aoun’s son-in-law, said his movement never doubted Hezbollah’s “loyalty” and “honesty.” Aoun is the founder of the FPM. 
He said Aoun’s victory was based on his own perseverance as well as the positions adopted by Sayyed Hassan Nasrallah, who is Hezbollah’s secretary general. 
In a phone call on the same day, Nasrallah congratulated Aoun on his election as the head of the Lebanese state. This image, taken in the southern suburbs of Beirut on October 31, 2016, shows people celebrating the election of Michel Aoun as the new president of Lebanon. 
Nasrallah endorsed Aoun last week, advising Lebanese political factions to set aside their differences in order to fill the presidential void in the Arab country. 
Lebanon had been without a president for over two years amid political bickering in the parliament. 
After the election, Aoun vowed in a speech to the parliament that he would spare no effort in trying to bring about the liberation of Lebanese territories occupied by Israel. 
He said his top priority would be to strengthen the army in order for it to become capable of defending the country against all threats to its independence and sovereignty. 
Hezbollah has been defending Lebanon against Israeli aggression since the movement’s inception, including during a full-fledged Israeli war in 2006.

Le terrorisme régional protège Israël,"Le terrorisme régional vise à protéger les intérêts d'Israël Wed Oct 26, 2016 9:35AM Iran Le ministre iranien de la Défense, le général Hossein Dehqan. ©Tasnim #iran #terrorisme 
Selon le ministre iranien de la Défense, le général de brigade Hossein Dehqan, l'objectif de la création et de la propagation du terrorisme et de l'extrémisme dans la région est de protéger le régime israélien. 
Le général Hossein Dehqan, ministre iranien de la Défense, a indiqué, lors d'une réunion du comité stratégique de défense de ce ministère, que la création et l'extension du terrorisme et de l'extrémisme visaient à protéger les intérêts du régime israélien, à maintenir l'instabilité dans la région et à y prolonger la présence des forces d'occupation arrogantes. 
""Les États-Unis et leurs alliés régionaux et internationaux scandent des slogans humanitaires d'un côté, mais de l'autre ils donnent le feu vert aux groupes terroristes tels que Fatah al-Cham (ex-Front al-Nosra), les autorisant ainsi à enfermer les civils dans les zones de combat et à les utiliser comme boucliers humains pour endiguer les opérations antiterroristes de l'armée syrienne, ce qui assure la survie des terroristes,"" a dit le ministre iranien de la Défense. 
""Pourtant, l'une des priorités et des principales préoccupations des commandants du front de la Résistance, est de sauver le peuple et de préparer leur évacuation hors des régions non sécurisées. C'est avec ce même souci qu'ils ont sauvé, d'ores et déjà, la vie de milliers de gens sans défense"", poursuit-il. 
""Dans tout lieu où une opération antiterroriste se dirigeait vers la victoire, les États-Unis et leurs alliés ont recouru à des projets mensongers de cessez-le-feu et procédéà des démarches prétendument pacifistes, dans le but, en fait, de sauver les terroristes, alors qu'au moment où les terroristes commettaient crimes et massacres, ils n'avaient fait qu'observer le silence."", a regretté le général Dehqan. 
""Dès le début de la formation des groupes terroristes takfiristes, la RII avait mis en garde contre les maux inimaginables que causeraient ces derniers en menaçant la sécurité de la région, voire du monde entier. L'ordre de l'Arrogance poursuit toutefois tous ses soutiens à ces groupes extrémistes"", a-t-il rappelé. 
Le ministre iranien de la Défense a exigé alors que l'on mette fin à la crise régionale, ce qui n'est possible, selon le responsable iranien, qu'avec la fin du soutien des États-Unis et de leurs alliés au terrorisme, le rejet du projet de démembrement des pays de la région, la reconnaissance des gouvernements légaux et l'aide à la lutte contre le terrorisme.

PressTV-US troops could be prosecuted for war crimes,"Military An American soldier talks with Saudi troops. (File photo by the US Army) 
A US congressman has warned that American troops could be prosecuted for providing military support to the Saudi war on Yemen. 
Ted Lieu made the warning in a letter to US Secretary of State John Kerry and Defense Secretary Ashton Carter, saying the US government’s denial of target selection for Saudi airstrikes in Yemen does not excuse Washington from legal responsibilities. 
“I find it deeply troubling that the US apparently has no advanced knowledge of what targets will be struck by jets that are refueled by US personnel with US tankers,” Lieu said in his letter. 
“The US would appear to be violating LOAC [laws of armed conflict] and international standards by engaging in such direct military operations if US personnel are not aware if targets are civilian or military, if the loss of life and property are disproportional, or if the operation is even militarily necessary,” he noted. A Yemeni boy walks past a mural depicting a US drone and reading: ""Why did you kill my family."" (Photo by AFP) 
Pointing to the 18-month involvement of the US in Saudi war on the Yemeni people, the Democratic congressman stressed that Washington had knowledge of a bombardment campaign hitting civilian targets, including schools and hospitals, multiple times. 
“US personnel are now at legal risk of being investigated and potentially prosecuted for committing war crimes. Under international law, a person can be found guilty of aiding and abetting war crimes. Under US law, a person can be found guilty for conspiring to commit war crimes,” Lieu wrote. 
The Pentagon has been providing logistic and surveillance support to Saudi Arabia in its military aggression against Yemen, the kingdom’s impoverished southern neighbor, which has killed more than 10,000 Yemenis since its onset in March 2015. 
The unprovoked war started by a coalition of Saudi-allies in an attempt to undermine the Houthi Ansarullah movement and reinstate former Yemeni President Abd Rabbuh Mansur Hadi, a staunch ally of the Riyadh regime. 
Washington has on several occasions criticized the Saudi regime for its crimes against humanity in Yemen, but has shown no sign of ending its support for Riyadh.

(Photo by AFP) 
In August, the US State Department approved the sale of more than 130 Abrams tanks, 20 armored recovery vehicles and other equipment worth about $1.15 billion to Saudi Arabia. 
Saudi-led bombardments have struck hospitals, markets and other places where civilians gather. 
In September, Amnesty International reported that a US manufactured bomb had been used in a Saudi strike against a Doctors Without Borders hospital in Yemen’s northwestern province of Hajjah which claimed the lives of 19 people. 
In October, more than 140 people lost their lives and over 525 others sustained injuries after Saudi military aircraft struck a hall in the Yemeni capital of Sana'a, where rows of people were attending a funeral.

PressTV-‘Clintons worked with US enemies’,"Interviews The FBI probe was inevitable “because of the metastasizing of the links and the connections that the Clinton Foundation had, most specifically and grievously to Saudi Arabia, to Qatar,” says American analyst Scott Bennett. 
The ongoing federal investigation into the Clinton Foundation was expected because of the Clinton family’s ties with US enemies, says Scott Bennett, a former US Army psychological warfare officer. 
The FBI has been probing possible pay-to-play schemes at the family foundation for over a year now and is “likely” to press charges against it, Fox News reported Wednesday, citing informed officials. 
Bennett told Press TV on Friday that the probe was inevitable “because of the metastasizing of the links and the connections that the Clinton Foundation had, most specifically and grievously to Saudi Arabia, to Qatar,” and many other countries blacklisted by Washington. 
It was revealed on Friday that the Clinton Foundation took a $1 million gift from Qatar during Hillary Clinton’s tenure as the US secretary of state, without her informing the State Department. 
Hillary decided to not inform the department of the transaction, despite signing an ethics agreement with regards to the foundation when she became secretary of state. 
According to the foundation’s website, Qatar has so far given the Clintons a total of between $1 million and $5 million over the years. 
Aside from Qatar, Saudi Arabia has also been one of the Clinton Foundation’s biggest donors. It became known in 2008 that the kingdom had given them between $10 million and $25 million. 
“So those terrorist entities, which have been labeled as the enemies of the United States, have been appearing as Clinton Foundation donors,” Bennett said. 
“That is a serious crime, it is treason, it is corruption, it is bribery of officials,” said the analyst. 
Bennett argued that all the leaks and investigations concerning the Clinton family were coming from “those personnel in the American government who have had enough.” 
“They have stepped up, they have released emails, they have hacked into their own computers and in some cases they have provided it to WikiLeaks,” he added. 
Whistle-blowing website WikiLeaks has released thousands of Hillary’s campaign chairman and top aide John Podesta’s emails since last month, exposing some of the well-kept secrets surrounding the Clinton family and Hillary Clinton’s bid for the White House. 
Bennett predicted that the case would “most probably” lead to indictments and some people would be arrested as early as this weekend. Loading ... ",1

Britain’s Prince Charles and his wife Camilla have arrived in Bahrain on a three-nation tour of the Persian Gulf states amid strong criticism of London’s continued arms sales to the repressive regime in Manama. 
The plane carrying the British royals touched down at Sakhir Air Base in central Bahrain on Tuesday on the last leg of the tour, which had already taken them to Oman and the United Arab Emirates. 
They were received by Bahrain’s Crown Prince Salman bin Hamad bin Isa Al Khalifah and then taken to a nearby palace to meet with the country’s King Hamad bin Isa Al Khalifah. 
Since 2011, the United Kingdom has sold 55 million dollars worth of arms to Bahrain. The year saw the eruption of peaceful anti-regime protests on the island. 
London has been under fire by international rights organizations for selling military equipment to Manama, which is involved in a harsh and deadly crackdown on opposition activists. 
It was reported late last month that the UK will open a massive permanent military base in Bahrain and deploy warships to the Persian Gulf. A Bahraini protester shouts slogans during clashes with regime forces in the village of Sitra, south of Manama, on February 12, 2015. (Photo by AFP) 
The military base, which is the first such facility being opened by Britain in 40 years in the Persian Gulf region, will be launched next month, Britain’s Express newspaper reported. 
Britain will station around 600 military forces at the Royal Navy Facility and will deploy its warships to patrol the surrounding waters and guard oil and gas shipments in the waters. 
When Britain kicked off the project in 2014, Defense Secretary Michael Fallon described it as “a permanent expansion of the Royal Navy’s footprint” in the Persian Gulf. The project has bypassed the parliament. 
According to data released by the UK Trade and Investment in September, the UK government has become the world’s second biggest arms dealer, with bulk of its weapons fueling deadly conflicts in the Middle East. Loading ... ",1
PressTV-'I can't punch Trump now he's president',"Politics US actor Robert De Niro (Photo by AFP) 
Hollywood actor Robert De Niro, who had criticized Americans for putting an “idiot” like Donald Trump in a position where he might become the US president, now says he respects him because he is the president-elect of the United States. 
Before the November 8 presidential election, De Niro had been enlisted along with several other actors to speak in a non-partisan video encouraging Americans to vote in. But the 73-year-old actor defied script and delivered a scathing rebuke of Trump. 
“He's so blatantly stupid. He's a punk, he's a dog, he's a pig [...] a mutt who [...] doesn't do his homework, doesn't care. He's an idiot. Colin Powell said it best: He's a national disaster. He's an embarrassment to this country,” the Raging Bull actor said. 
“It makes me so angry that this country has gotten to this point that this fool, this bozo, has wound up where he has,” he stated. 
“He talks how he wants to punch people in the face? Well, I'd like to punch him in the face,” De Niro said. 
But after the Republican presidential nominee was declared the 45th president-elect on Wednesday, De Niro clarified that he would no longer like to punch Trump because the man was elected to the highest seat in political office. 
The veteran actor, however, told Jimmy Kimmel on his late-night show on ABC News that he is “not feeling good” after Trump’s victory, which caused protests and student walkouts across the country. 
Protesters on Wednesday slammed Trump’s divisive campaign rhetoric against immigrants, refugees, Muslims and ethnic minorities. 
De Niro said he has to respect Trump because of his new position - which means no punching. 
“Are you still going to punch Donald Trump in the face?” Kimmel asked the actor, “because you could now get arrested for that, I think."" 
“I can’t do that now, he’s the President,” replied De Niro. “And I have to respect that position, although we all know what he… We have to see what he’s gonna do and how he’s really gonna follow through on certain things. As we can see now in a lot of cities, a lot of people are getting very upset and protesting.” 
Many renowned figures, including some heads of states and other high-ranking officials, had publicly denounced Trump -- some even used abusive language against him -- in the run-up to the November 8 presidential election. But several of them have now softened their stance and some even sent messages of congratulations to the president-elect. Loading ...",1
Bahrainis support senior Shia cleric Sheikh Qassim,"Persian Gulf This photo shows anti-regime protesters taking part in a demonstration in the village of Musalla, Bahrain, on November 11, 2016. 
Bahrainis have taken to the streets in several villages and towns in support of senior Shia cleric Sheikh Isa Qassim. 
On Friday, a mass protest was held near Imam Sadiq mosque in the village of Diraz, the hometown of the cleric. 
The demonstrators condemned Manama’s continued ban on holding Friday prayers in the village. 
On June 20, Bahraini authorities stripped the 79-year-old cleric of his citizenship, less than a week after suspending the al-Wefaq National Islamic Society, the country’s main opposition bloc, and dissolving the Islamic Enlightenment Institution, founded by Qassim, and the opposition al-Risala Islamic Association. 
People in the villages of Shakhoura and Abu Saiba also demonstrated in solidarity with Sheikh Qassem and the political detainees despite tightened security measures. 
Similar anti-regime demonstrations were held in the villages of Ma'ameer, Karbabad, Shahrakan, Sehla al-Janoubia and Musalla as well as the town of A'ali and the island of Nabih Saleh. 
The protesters also condemned the Al Khalifah regime for its persecution of the Shia community. 
Thousands of anti-regime protesters have held numerous demonstrations in Bahrain on an almost daily basis ever since a popular uprising began in the country on February 14, 2011. The protesters demand that the Al Khalifah dynasty relinquish power. 
Scores of people have lost their lives and hundreds of others sustained injuries or got arrested as a result of the regime’s crackdown. Loading ...",1
PressTV-Sanders to Trump: Don’t target minorities,"Politics US Senator Bernie Sanders 
Former US Democratic presidential candidate Bernie Sanders has threatened President-elect Donald Trump, warning that his camp will be Trump’s “worst nightmare” if he goes after minorities in America. 
""If Donald Trump takes people's anger and turns it against Muslims, Hispanics, African Americans and women, we will be his worst nightmare,"" the Vermont senator wrote on his Twitter page on Thursday. 
The 74-year-old senator had earlier issued a statement after the New York businessman’s victory in the US election on November 8, promising to work with him on certain issues but also to oppose him should he pursue divisive and discriminatory policies. 
“To the degree that Mr. Trump is serious about pursuing policies that improve the lives of working families in this country, I and other progressives are prepared to work with him,” Sanders said. 
“To the degree that he pursues racist, sexist, xenophobic and anti-environment policies, we will vigorously oppose him,” he added. 
During the primaries, Sanders ran a close race with Clinton and promised to continue the fight all the way until the Democratic National Convention in June, where the party’s nominee was going to be named. 
Towards the end of the race, however, Sanders changed his tone and bowed out in favor of Clinton. He also appeared next to her during the DNC and supported his party opponent in the Democratic campaigns. 
On July 12, 2016, Sanders formally endorsed Clinton after facing mounting pressure from major Democratic figures, including outgoing US President Barack Obama himself.

(Photo by AFP) 
On Tuesday, Trump stunned the world by defeating heavily favored Clinton in the presidential election, sending the United States on a new, uncertain path. 
Trump rode a wave of anger toward the elite US establishment to win the White House race against Clinton, a longtime Washington insider. 
The New York businessman garnered 290 electoral votes in the 2016 US election, while his rival and the former secretary of state received 232 votes despite winning the popular vote. 
Thousands of people since then have rallied in cities across the US to protest against Trump's presidential election victory, condemning his controversial campaign rhetoric against Muslims, immigrants, women and other groups. 
This is while Trump said in his victory speech he would be president for all Americans. ""It is time for us to come together as one united people,” he said. 
The real estate mogul's election campaign had been marred by his disparaging remarks against minorities in the US. His comments include a call to ban all Muslims from coming to America as well as stopping Mexican migrants by building a long wall along the US-Mexico border. 
He has also sought for a database to track Muslims across the United States and said that the US would have ""absolutely no choice"" but to close down mosques. 
Trump’s proposal was widely condemned by Muslim and human rights groups as well as his Democratic rivals and many of his Republican proponents who describe the proposal as divisive, counterproductive and contrary to American values. Loading ... ",1

At least 47 people, including women and children, have been killed and over 110 others injured in a huge bomb explosion in Pakistan’s Balochistan province. 
The blast hit Shah Noorani shrine in Lasbela district on Saturday evening, Balochistan's Home Minister Sarfaraz Bugti said. 
The shrine is located about 100 kilometers north of the port city of Karachi. Staff members of a local hospital in Karachi wait for casualties of a bomb blast at Shah Noorani shrine in Balochistan province, Pakistan, November 12, 2016. (Photo by AP) 
The injured, he added, would be taken to hospitals in Lasbela, Khuzdar or Civil Hospital in Karachi as there are no medical centers available in the area. 
Pakistani Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif denounced the bomb attack, calling on authorities to speed up the rescue operation. 
Reports say some 500 people were in the shrine when the bomb went off. 
""Every day, around sunset, there is a dhamaal (a Sufi ritual dance) here, and there are large numbers of people who come for this,"" said Nawaz Ali, the shrine's custodian. 
The Daesh terror group has claimed responsibility for the deadly attack. 
Pakistani security officials are saying the terrorist attack was in response to the killing of Jundullah chief by Pakistani police which took place in the early hours of Friday morning. 
On October 24, Daesh also claimed responsibility for the killing of at least 60 people in an attack by its terrorists on a police college in Baluchistan’s provincial capital Quetta. It was one of the deadliest attacks on Pakistan's security forces in recent years. 
In August, Daesh claimed responsibility for another attack on a gathering of mourners at a hospital in Quetta, where 70 people were killed. The attack was also claimed by Pakistani Taliban faction Jamaat-ul-Ahrar. 
Pakistan’s restive and mineral-rich Balochistan province is rife with separatist, extremist and sectarian violence and has been the scene of several bomb and gun attacks over the past years. Loading ... ",1
Clinton campaign blames FBI director for loss to Trump,"Politics FBI Director James Comey (AFP file photo) 
Hillary Clinton’s top advisers blame FBI Director James Comey for the Democrat’s bruising loss to President-elect Donald Trump. 
Navin Nayak, the head of the Clinton campaign’s opinion research division, sent an email to senior staffers Thursday, outlining “early signals” as to why the candidate lost the November 8 presidential election, POLITICO reported on Friday. 
“We believe that we lost this election in the last week,” said Nayak’s email, which was published by POLITICO. “ Comey’s letter in the last 11 days of the election both helped depress our turnout and also drove away some of our critical support among college-educated white voters — particularly in the suburbs.” 
“We also think Comey’s 2nd letter, which was intended to absolve Sec. Clinton, actually helped to bolster Trump’s turnout,” he continued. 
The letter also highlighted several other challenges the Clinton team faced throughout the campaign, including a desire for change after two terms by a Democratic president and the reluctance of some Americans to vote for a female candidate. Hillary Clinton makes a concession speech after being defeated by Donald Trump in New York on November 9, 2016. (Photo by AFP) 
Despite those challenges, Nayak said, Clinton was on course to win until the last week, when “everything changed"" and the momentum began to shift in favor of Trump. 
“Voters who decided in the last week broke for Trump by a larger margin (42-47). These numbers were even more exaggerated in the key battleground states,” he said. 
The FBI director angered Democrats late in October by announcing in a letter to Congress that the agency had uncovered new emails connected to the Clinton email investigation. 
Just over a week later, Comey notified Congress that Clinton would not face charges over the newly discovered messages. 
Nayak said Comey’s letters encouraged Trump supporters and depressed the turnout for Clinton on Election Day. 
“There is no question that a week from Election Day, Sec. Clinton was poised for a historic win. In the end, less than 110K votes out of tens of millions cast on Election Day made the difference in this race,” he wrote. 
“In the end,” Nayak concluded, “late breaking developments in the race proved one hurdle too many for us to overcome.” 
Clinton had been leading Trump throughout the campaign in most of the polls except for the last week of the election when she lost ground to Trump.",1

The commander of US forces in Afghanistan has promised an investigation into the recent death of more than 30 Afghan civilians, including women and children, in an airstrike. 
General John Nicholson said Saturday that the airstrike on the village of Buz Kandahari, just outside the northern city of Kunduz on Thursday, would be probed. 
Three Taliban leaders were supposed to be targeted in the raid, but the forces met “significant enemy fire from multiple locations"" and called for help from a US aircraft, which left 33 civilians, including 17 children, dead. 
""An initial investigation has determined that efforts near Kunduz on November 3 to defend Afghan National Defense and Security Forces likely resulted in civilian casualties,"" Nicholson said in a statement. ""We will work with our Afghan partners to investigate and determine the facts and we will work with the government of Afghanistan to provide assistance."" 
The targets were high-ranking elements of the Takfiri group that were supposed to be hit in their houses, according to Afghan Defense Ministry spokesman Dawlat Waziri. 
""They weren't ordinary people who had gathered. They were leading fighting in Kunduz. They were the commanders of their military commission,"" Waziri said. 
Taliban militants were removed from power following the 2001 US-led invasion of Afghanistan, but they have stepped up their activities in recent months, attempting to overrun several provinces. 
Afghan forces have been engaged in fierce clashes with Taliban to contain the ongoing insurgency across various parts of the violence-wrecked country. 
The rising violence in Afghanistan comes despite the presence of thousands of foreign troops in the country. Loading ... ",1
PressTV-Russian warships flotilla off Syrian coast,"Syria This October 19, 2016 photo provided by Norwegian Armed Forces shows a plane taking off from Russian aircraft carrier Admiral Kuznetsov (R) with helicopters escorting nuclear-powered battle cruiser Pyotr Veliky (L) southwest of the city of Trondheim in international waters on its way to the Mediterranean. 
A fleet of Russian warships has entered the eastern Mediterranean off the coast of Syria amid speculations that Moscow and Damascus are about to launch a massive operation against terrorists in the northern Syrian city of Aleppo. 
The commander of Russian aircraft carrier Admiral Kuznetsov told state-owned Russia-1 television network on Saturday that the military vessels were positioned in the “designated zone... in the eastern Mediterranean and are now jointly carrying out tasks, maneuvering to the west of the Syrian coast.” 
Captain 1st rank Sergei Artamonov added that fighter jets have already started taking off from the carrier’s deck to survey the conflict zone. 
“Flights are being carried out from the deck... they are working on coordination with the shore port. The flights have been going on practically every day for the last four days,” the high-ranking Russian naval commander pointed out. 
The remarks came a day after Russia’s Interfax news agency reported that Russian MiG and Sukhoi warplanes routinely fly from the Kuznetsov aircraft carrier into the Syrian airspace to “determine combat missions.” 
Meanwhile, the commander of the Pyotr Veliky nuclear-powered battle cruiser, Captain 1st rank Vladislav Malakhovsky, said on Saturday that no foreign aircraft dared to “come closer than 50 kilometers” away from the Russian fleet. This file photo shows Russian frigate Admiral Grigorovich on its way to the Mediterranean. (Photo by Reuters) 
On November 4, Russian frigate Admiral Grigorovich passed through the Bosphorus Strait in northwestern Turkey and arrived off the Syrian coast. 
Grigorovich is reportedly capable of launching land-attack Kalibr cruise missiles, which are equivalent to US Tomahawk ones and equipped with the latest high precision guidance systems. 
Russia has been bombing Daesh and Jabhat Fateh al-Sham, formerly known as the al-Nusra Front, terror groups in Syria since September 30, 2015 at the official request of President Bashar al-Assad. 
Backed by Russia’s aerial campaign, the Syrian troops have retaken several militant-held areas in the Arab country. 
Syria has been gripped by foreign-backed militancy since March 2011. United Nations Special Envoy for Syria Staffan de Mistura estimates that over 400,000 people have been killed in the conflict. Loading ... ",1
PressTV-Putin: Why would we attack anybody?,"Russia Russian President Vladimir Putin delivers a speech during an international conference dedicated to the 175th anniversary of Sberbank in Moscow on November 10, 2016. (Photos by AFP) 
Russian President Vladimir Putin has stressed that his country’s military is not a threat and would not be attacking anybody. 
“Our Armed Forces are not threatening anybody…I would like to stress once again, to make sure everyone hears – not only people in this hall,” said Putin while giving a speech in Russia’s Yaroslavl on Saturday. 
Referring to claims that Russia might attack other countries, especially its neighbors in the Baltics, Putin asked, “Why would we do this?” 
“We have the biggest territory in the world, like I said, everyone knows it, and we need to provide effectively security for our own country, for our own people,” he added. 
He noted that Russia’s armed forces are perfectly capable of providing security, and that developing the forces will continue. He also hailed efforts made so far to make the military “efficient… modern and highly effective.” 
“The number of military drills has increased multiple times, including snap checks, which for some reasons from time to time worry our counterparts, let’s call them as such for now,"" he added. 
He added that other countries' drills do not worry Russia. The Russian army must be “compact, but highly effective. Thus we shall continue the structural reform, and we shall keep optimizing the personnel, but without any mass cuts."" Russian female cadets take part in the military parade at Red Square in Moscow on November 7, 2016. 
Putin’s remarks come at a time that NATO aims to send “battle groups” to the Baltic states and Poland early next year. The groups will consist of 40,000 forces. It will be the biggest military buildup near Russia since the Second World War. More forces would also be deployed if necessary. 
NATO suspended all ties with Moscow in April 2014, after the then-Ukrainian Crimea Peninsula voted in a referendum to join Russian territory. Loading ... ",1
PressTV-Americans ‘repudiated Clinton foreign policy’,"Interviews US Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton stands with President Barack Obama during an election eve rally on November 7, 2016 in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. 
The American people have “repudiated the foreign policy” of President Barack Obama and former secretary of state Hillary Clinton which was “a complete disgrace” for the United States, according to James Fetzer, an American scholar and political analyst. 
Professor Fetzer made the remarks in a phone interview with Press TV on Monday, days after Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump stunned the world by defeating the heavily-favored Democratic candidate, Hillary Clinton, in the November 8 election. 
During the election campaign, Trump repeatedly expressed his willingness to work with Russian President Vladimir Putin and other leaders in order to resolve global problems, including the issue of Daesh terrorism, which he has blamed on the policies of the Obama administration. 
On the other hand, Clinton has shown eagerness to confront Russia and continue the interventionist policies US administrations have practiced since 9/11. 
Professor Fetzer said that “Clinton was behind the massacre of Libya, the butchery of Benghazi, the transfer of weapons to ‘rebels’ in Syria.” 
More than five years after the overthrow of Muammar Gaddafi, Libya has become a failed state, with the central government holding no sway over the country, and Africa’s wealthiest nation has become a haven for terrorist organizations. 
And since 2011, the United States and its allies have been sponsoring terrorists wreaking havoc in Syria. 
Professor Fetzer stated that Clinton was being advised by Israeli intelligence, telling her ""how to conduct American foreign policy. It was a complete disgrace.” 
“The American people have repudiated the foreign policy of Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton,” the scholar said. 
“Donald Trump is going to restore a measure of sanity. He is going to end the wars in the Middle East. He is going to restore the reputation of the United States for integrity, and dealing with the international community,” he noted. 
“He respects Russia as should any president of the United States, where Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton fell miserably short,” the analyst pointed out. 
“I believe we are already seeing signs that the situation for the world community is going to vastly, dramatically improve, that the United States is going to conduct itself in accordance with international law, and restrain from regime change, and hopefully we will no longer be the greatest aggressor nation in the world,” Fetzer said in his concluding remarks.

PressTV-Catch a glimpse of spectacular Supermoon Monday,"Society Naza says the upcoming full moon will appear up to 14 percent bigger and 30 percent brighter than usual. 
The brightest moon in almost 69 years will be lighting up the night sky this week in a treat for star watchers around the globe. 
The phenomenon, known as the supermoon, will reach its zenith in Asia and the South Pacific on Monday night. 
It will then reach its most brightest mode in North America before dawn on Monday. 
Across the international dateline in New Zealand, it will reach its brightest after midnight on Tuesday local time. 
If skies are clear, the upcoming full moon will appear up to 14 percent bigger and 30 percent brighter than usual, according to NASA. This image shows a near full moon in Aravica, Arizona, on October 13, 2016. (Photo by AFP) 
The moon’s distance from Earth varies because it is in an egg-shaped, not circular, orbit around the planet. 
Since the moon’s orbit is elliptical, one side (perigee) is about 50,000 kilometers closer to Earth than the other (apogee). 
The word syzygy is the scientific term used for when the Earth, sun, and moon line up as the moon orbits Earth. 
When perigee-syzygy of the Earth-moon-sun system occurs and the moon is on the opposite side of the Earth from the sun, we get a perigee moon, which is more commonly known as supermoon. 
This coincidence already happened one time on October 16. 
On November 14 and December 14, it happens again, as the moon becomes full on the same day as perigee. On November 14, it becomes full within about two hours of perigee—arguably making it an extra -supermoon. 
The full moon of November 14 is not only the closest full moon of 2016 but also the closest full moon to date in the 21st century. 
The next time a full moon comes this close to Earth will be November 25, 2034. Loading ... ",1

Thousands of Britons have signed a petition to express their outrage over Queen Elizabeth’s use of £369 million in taxpayers' money to repair the Buckingham Palace. 
More than 94,000 people had signed the petition as of Sunday, two days after the government of Prime Minister Theresa May allowed the royal family to repair the palace with public funds. 
The UK Parliament should discuss the petition when it hits the 100,000 mark. 
On Friday, the Chancellor of the Exchequer Philip Hammond granted the 90-year-old Queen a 66-percent rise in funding required for the palace’s refurbishment over the next 10 years. 
The money would be used to replace cables, pipes and boilers installed 60 years ago to prevent a “catastrophic” event that might destroy the palace, according to Master of the Queen’s Household Tony Johnstone-Burt. 
Petitioners argued that the royals should foot the massive bill themselves given the vast extent of their wealth. 
“The Crown and its estates should be made to fund its own renovations,” wrote Mark Johnson, who posted the petition. 
Protesters said the money could be used to mend the faltering National Health Service (NHS) or help families get more affordable homes amid a housing crisis.

“It is wholly unreasonable to cut the benefits of the sick and disabled, take away housing benefits from the poor, and then pay for this,” said one signatory of the petition. 
The anti-monarchy campaign group Republic also took issue with the announcement, denouncing it as a “disgrace.” 
“What's worse is this appalling increase is only a small part of the annual cost of the Royal family, which we put at £334m,” said Graham Smith, a member of the group. 
Over the past years, the UK government has been generous towards the royal family despite cutting billions in public money. 
Under former treasury minister George Osborne, the Queen’s sovereign grant for 2016 was increased by 7 percent, bringing the total to £42.9 million a year. Now the annual grant would be inflated by two-thirds, rising to £76 million in 2017. 
The grant is financed by the profit coming from the royal family’s 350,000 acres of land across the UK. Loading ... ",1

In a post on his Twitter account, his son, Adam, said that his father was transferred for the third time to a police hospital after suffering from chest pain. 
The 52-year-old president of the Bahrain Center for Human Rights has been repeatedly detained for organizing pro-democracy demonstrations and publishing Twitter posts deemed “insulting” to the Bahraini authorities. 
He was pardoned for health reasons last year, but was re-arrested on June 13 following an intensive search of his house in the northwest of the country. Reports suggest he has been subjected to harassment in jail. 
Thousands of anti-regime protesters have held numerous demonstrations in Bahrain on an almost daily basis ever since a popular uprising began in the kingdom on February 14, 2011. 
They are demanding that the Al Khalifah dynasty relinquish power and a just system representing all Bahrainis be established. 
On March 14, 2011, troops from Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates were deployed to Bahrain to assist the Manama government in its crackdown on peaceful protesters.

Car bomb kills over 80 people south of Iraqi capital,"Iraq Iraqi firefighters work to extinguish the fire caused by a car bomb explosion at a gas station near the city of Hilla, November 24, 2016. 
A car bomb has reportedly exploded south of the Iraqi capital, Baghdad, killing around 100 people, mostly Shia pilgrims. 
According to security sources, a truck loaded with explosives went off on Thursday at a gas station in the Shomali village in the suburbs of the city of al-Hilla, located 120 kilometers (75 miles) southeast of the capital Baghdad and around 80 kilometers (50 miles) from Karbala. 
Reports say most of the victims were Iranian nationals. The photo shows the site of a blast at a gas station near Hilla, south of the Iraqi capital, Baghdad, November 24, 2016. 
The incident occurred at a time when buses packed with Shia pilgrims were parked at the gas station. The people were returning from Arba’een mourning rituals in the holy city of Karbala. 
“At least seven buses with pilgrims were inside the petrol station at the time,” an unnamed police lieutenant colonel told AFP. People carry away the bodies of victims from the site of a bomb attack near Hilla, Iraq, November 24, 2016. 
AFP also quoted an unnamed police intelligence source as saying that “those buses were loaded with Iranians, Bahrainis and Iraqis. Ambulances and civil defense are on their way to the site.” 
The Takfiri Daesh terrorist group claimed responsibility for the deadly bombing. 
In recent weeks, Daesh has resorted to similar acts of violence in areas outside its control in a desperate attempt to undermine a large Iraqi battle aimed at liberating the northern city of Mosul, the terror group’s last remaining foothold in the country. 
‘Iran won’t waver in backing Iraq’ 
Hours after the incident, Iran’s Foreign Ministry spokesman strongly condemned the fatal terrorist blast, expressing sympathy with the Iraqi government and nation as well as all the families of the victims. 
Touching on reports that Iranian citizens were among the victims, Bahram Qassemi said, “The Foreign Ministry and the Islamic Republic of Iran’s Embassy in Baghdad are investigating the issue with seriousness” and will take necessary measures in that regard. 
The Iranian official also stressed that such pre-planned and savage assaults emanate from the desperation of the terrorists, who are taking successive blows on the battlefield. 
“These brutal and inhumane acts will not affect the Iraqi government and nation’s determination and the Islamic Republic of Iran’s support for the oppressed Iraqi people in the unrelenting fight against terrorism,” Qassemi said. The photo shows the site of a blast at a gas station near Hilla, south of the Iraqi capital, Baghdad, November 24, 2016. 
‘Terrorists killing pilgrims will be brought to justice’ 
In another development, Iraq’s President Fuad Masum strongly condemned the terrorist attack in Hilla, emphasizing that such terrorist crimes would not go unpunished. 
Issuing an official statement hours after the terrorist attack, which was claimed by the Daesh Takfiri group, Masum emphasized that terrorists, who target the lives of innocent pilgrims traveling to Iraq from Islamic countries, will be brought to justice. 
He also called on Iraq’s security forces to double their efforts and take necessary measures to uproot terrorist groups that endanger the life and safety of the pilgrims visiting Iraq’s holy shrines.

‘Takfiris spilling blood in the name of religion’ 
Meanwhile, Lebanon’s resistance movement, Hezbollah, condemned the explosion as a crime committed by the terrorists, who have no conscience and spill the blood of innocents in the name of the religion. 
In a statement released on Thursday, Hezbollah extended its condolences to the Iraqi nation over the tragedy, calling for more efforts to root out terror outfits in Iraq and restore security to the country.

Iranian Parliament Speaker Ali Larijani says the European Union can play a significant role in the settlement of the Syrian crisis and the campaign against terrorism. 
Larijani made the remarks in a meeting with visiting Finnish President Sauli Niinistö in Tehran on Wednesday. 
He said that Iran supports political solutions to crises in the Middle East, including the conflict in Syria, while some extra-regional players as well as regional sponsors of terrorist groups sabotaged diplomatic solutions through adopting wrong approaches. 
The top Iranian parliamentarian also warned against the spillover of terrorism to other regions across the world. 
“Unfortunately, military intervention by outsiders in regional issues and adopting a military approach and double standards on terrorism” have led to a rise in the number of terrorist groups and contributed to their activities, Larijani said. 
He also blamed the “extremist and deviated” ideology of Wahhabism for the spread of terrorism in the region, stressing that neither Sunnis nor Shias support terrorist or extremist acts. 
Elsewhere in his remarks, Larijani welcomed the expansion of ties between Tehran and Helsinki. 
The Finnish official, for his part, called for the further promotion of ties between his country and Iran. 
He also expressed regret about terrorist attacks in Afghanistan, Iraq and Syria and the lack of a political will to end the conflicts. 
‘Terrorists pose threat to their own countries’

The senior Iranian official also raised the alarm over the issue of “state terrorism” pursued by the Zionists.

Syria rejects West accusations over chemical attacks,"Syria A man receives treatment at a hospital following a Daesh chemical attack in the Sheikh Maqsood neighborhood of Syria’s Aleppo, April 7, 2016. (Photo by RT) 
Syria has dismissed as baseless recent allegations brought against the Damascus government by Western countries in connection with chemical attacks in the war-torn Arab country. 
“The Syrian Arab Republic has repeatedly denied all allegations circulated by some Western circles and their agents about the use of chemical poisonous materials by Syrian sides, like chlorine gas,” during military operations against terrorists, Syria’s Foreign Ministry said in a statement carried by the official SANA news agency on Wednesday. 
The statement came four days after an international inquiry blamed Syrian government forces for a toxic gas attack in Qminas in northwestern Idlib province on March 16, 2015. 
The accusation was made in the fourth report from the 13-month-long probe by the United Nations and the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons. 
However, the Syrian Foreign Ministry statement said that there was no ""tangible evidence"" for the inquiry's findings. 
“Syria has repeatedly warned against repercussions of politicizing this issue regarding the credibility of the work of international relevant sides,” the ministry added. 
It also stressed that the Syrian government remains committed to all its obligations under the Chemical Weapons Convention, a multilateral treaty that bans chemical weapons and requires their destruction. 
Daesh has frequently used chemical weapons in both in Syria and Iraq, where the Takfiri terrorist group is mainly active. 
A report by the Syrian-American Medical Society published back in March said that Daesh had carried out more than 160 attacks involving “poisonous or asphyxiating agents, such as sarin, chlorine, and mustard gas” since the beginning of the conflict in Syria. The report added that over 1,490 people had been killed in the chemical attacks.

John Steppling, author and commentator, told Press TV that the Israeli authorities “have been getting away with the violations of international law for 50 years,” as a result of the US’ all-out support for their crimes. 
“They (the Israeli authorities) pretty much do what they want because the United States protects them,” he added. 
According to the author, “Israel doesn’t care what the UN says, what do they care [about is] that the United States gives them three billion dollars a year in military aid regardless of anything.” 
The analyst also expressed concern about “what will happen once Hillary Clinton becomes president, as she has a very close relationship with Israel, [and] very close relationship with Netanyahu, and Israel may very well feel empowered to take even bolder steps in what has been frankly incremental genocide against Palestinians.” 
The occupied territories have been the scene of increased tensions ever since Israeli forces imposed restrictions on the entry of Palestinian worshipers into the al-Aqsa Mosque compound in August 2015. 
Over 250 Palestinians have been killed by Israeli forces since the beginning of last October. Loading ...",1
Philippine President Duterte wants US troops out in two years,"More Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte speaks during a banquet hosted by Japan's Prime Minister Shinzo Abe (not pictured) in Tokyo on October 26, 2016. (Photo by AFP) 
Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte says he wants US troops out of his country in the next two years, amid rising tensions between Manila and Washington. 
Duterte told an economic forum in the Japanese capital Tokyo on Wednesday that Manila was also willing to scrap defense pacts with Washington if necessary. 
""I want, maybe in the next two years, my country free of the presence of foreign military troops,"" Duterte said in a clear reference to US forces, adding, ""I want them out and if I have to revise or abrogate agreements, executive agreements, I will."" 
Duterte told reporters on Tuesday before leaving for Japan that if he stayed longer, he would not sign the Enhanced Defense Cooperation Agreement (EDCA) with the United States. 
President Duterte has promised that he would review the defense pact. He has already said that the presence of the US troops in the island of Mindanao could complicate Manila’s operations against the Abu Sayyaf militant group, notorious for different terrorist attacks in the country. 
In a meeting with business leaders in the Chinese capital Beijing last week, Duterte said the Philippines would ""separate"" from the United States and realign with China and Russia.

Last month, the Filipino leader harshly criticized the US and President Barack Obama, saying he was not a “puppet” of America. “I am the president of a sovereign country and I am not answerable to anyone except the Filipino people.” 
Washington is critical of Duterte’s bloody war on drugs. The attitude has led to tensions between the Philippines and the United States. Loading ...",1
5.4-magnitude earthquake jolts central Italy,"The photo taken on October 4, 2016, shows destruction in the village of Amatrice that was rattled by an earthquake on August 24. (Photo by AFP) 
An earthquake measuring 5.4 on the Richter scale has hit central Italy, including the capital Rome. 
Italy's national geophysics institute said the quake struck at a depth of nine kilometers in the Macerata area of the central region of Marche on Wednesday. 
The United States Geological Survey (USGS) confirmed the magnitude, saying the epicenter was seven kilometers south-southwest of Visso village in Macerata. 
There was no information immediately available about potential casualties or damage caused by the quake, which was felt in the towns of Pescara, Ancone and L'Aquila, which was jolted by a 6.3-magnitude quake in 2009 that killed over 300 people. 
Wednesday’s quake rattled windows and doors in the capital of Rome. 
The quake comes about two months after nearly 300 people were killed as a strong earthquake hit central Italy. 
On August 24, a powerful earthquake measuring 6.2 on the Richter scale hit Italy, and almost flattened scores of towns and villages in the central parts. The quake was followed by a series of aftershocks, the strongest of which measured 4.2, rattling the already hit areas. Loading ...",1
‘US undermining Daesh fight to get footing in Syria’,"Interviews Syria should be able to choose its allies in the battle against Daesh, says American political analyst James Petras. 
The Pentagon's plan to launch an offensive against the Daesh (ISIL) terrorist group in Syria is only aimed at undermining a successful attempt by the Syrian government and its allies to defeat the terror group, says James Petras, an American political commentator. 
US Defense Secretary Ashton Carter told NBC News on Wednesday that the Pentagon is planning a ground offensive to oust Daesh from the Syrian city of Raqqah, the terror group’s stronghold in the country. 
Carter, who was in Iraq earlier this week amid the ongoing battle to retake the city of Mosul from Daesh, said the Raqqah offensive would begin when Iraq’s second largest city is cleared. 
He claimed that US forces won't be directly involved in any of the operations. 
“This is a ploy to have the US in northern Syria,” Petras said, arguing that the US was seeking to undermine international efforts to defeat Daesh in a bid to reinforce its own foothold in the conflict-ridden country. 
“I don’t believe that the attack on Raqqah is a positive move because I think it brings the US closer to its policy of establishing a no-fly zone in northern Syria which will directly affect the efforts of the Syrian government and its allies—Iran and Russia—to defend the country.” 
The analyst noted that Raqqah is a “problem for the Syrian people” and Damascus should be allowed to choose its allies in the battle. 
Petras went on to note that Carter’s remarks bear similarities to US Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton’s plans for a “conflagration” in the Middle East. 
The ongoing Western efforts in Syria have a different nature. Washington and its allies have come under fire for openly seeking to remove President Bashar al-Assad from power. 
Carter’s claim that US ground forces will have no part in the fight against Daesh came at a time when more than 5,000 American soldiers were stationed in Iraq, tasked with providing training and intelligence to Iraqi forces. Loading ...",1
"In Khartoum, protest against 'land grab' turns violent","Sudan This file photo shows people in the Jreif district of the Sudanese capital Khartoum protesting against the government's land policies. 
Clashes involving police have erupted in the Sudanese capital Khartoum as hundreds of people demonstrated in protest against the government's land policies. 
The peaceful protest turned violent after riot police fired tear gas canisters at the demonstrators in East Jreif district. 
“Our land belongs to our ancestors and the government wants to give it to investors. We are protesting to save our land,” a protester said, regretting that the government had shown no intention of compensating the land owners in case their property was seized. 
Some protesters pelted police officers and members of security forces with rocks. Others burned tires and tried to close off all the streets in East Jreif. 
Police had a heavy presence with reports saying that 15 trucks of riot policemen armed with batons were deployed in the area. 
People stage routine protests in Sudan, complaining about local grievances, but most of the demonstrations are crushed by security forces. A similar demonstration in East Jreif last year led to the death of a protester. Anti-government rallies in April also left two students dead. 
There was no immediate report of possible casualties during the Wednesday rally in Khartoum. 
A government decision to slash fuel subsidies in September 2013 sparked mass protests in Sudan. Thousands of people took to the streets in the capital and some other towns, calling for President Omar al-Bashir to step down. Human rights groups say about 200 people were killed, hundreds were wounded and more than 800 were arrested in the protests. The government challenges the figures. Loading ...",1
"Secret talks between Mozambique opposition, EU mediators canceled","More The file photo shows former rebel Renamo fighters in Gorongosa, Mozambique. (Photo by AFP) 
Secret peace negotiations between Mozambique's opposition leader Afonso Dhlakama and EU mediators were annulled at the weekend after fighting erupted between the country's army and former rebel fighters, local media say. 
The meeting aimed to contribute to talks that began in May to find a solution to the conflict between the government and Dhlakama’s rebel group turned political party Renamo. 
""We had agreed (with President Filipe Nyusi) that two mediators would come ... to meet me,"" the independent weekly Canal de Mocambique quoted Dhlakama as saying. 
Dhlakama said he had cancelled the meeting after the army increased its presence near the place of the meeting. 
""There was a violent shootout. I even heard explosions from here,"" said Dhlakama, who has been in hiding in the central Gorongosa mountains since October 2015. 
""So I called (chief mediator Mario) Raffaelli to tell him that armed forces had come to ambush me,"" he added. 
Dhlakama quoted the mediator as saying that he was ""convinced"" that the ruling Frelimo party ""wanted to capture me during the meeting."" 
""It is obvious they have a plan to kill me,"" he added. 
Raffaelli declined to comment on the matter but an EU diplomat, who spoke on condition of anonymity, confirmed that two mediators had gone to Gorongosa for a meeting with the opposition leader. 
The diplomat said Dhlakama had told the mediators to ""turn back at the very last moment."" 
The political situation in Mozambique has been tense for months with Dhlakama refusing to recognize the results of the 2014 elections, where the Frelimo party was declared the winner. The party has been in power since the southern African country’s independence from Portugal in 1975. Dhlakama also threatened to seize power by force in the northern half of the country. 
Renamo and the Frelimo-led government had been engaged in a civil war for 16 years that was brought to an end in 1992. 
Renamo's armed wing has conducted a string of fatal assaults in central Mozambique in recent years as it seeks to increase its share of power. 
On October 19, the warring sides resumed a new round of peace talks despite the killing of an opposition negotiator on October 9. 
The mediators continued separate talks on Tuesday with representatives of each side. Loading ...",1
UNESCO passes anti-Israel resolution despite Tel Aviv brickbats,"Palestine The file photo shows a view of al-Aqsa Mosque in East Jerusalem al-Quds. 
The United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) has approved a motion that endorses the right of the Palestinians to the al-Aqsa Mosque compound and slams Israeli provocations around the holy site. 
UNESCO's 21-member World Heritage Committee adopted the resolution in Wednesday's secret ballot at the agency’s headquarters in Paris. 
Ten countries voted for, two against, eight abstained and one was absent in the voting. 
The resolution expresses UNESCO’s deep concerns over Israeli construction works and archaeological excavations in the Old City of Jerusalem al-Quds. 
Saeb Erekat, the secretary general of the Palestine Liberation Organization, welcomed the passage of the motion and accused the Tel Aviv regime of resorting to a campaign of distorting facts in a bid to legitimize its occupation of East Jerusalem al-Quds. 
“Through an orchestrated campaign, Israel has been using archaeological claims and distortion of facts as a way to legitimize the annexation of occupied East Jerusalem,” Erekat said. 
He further noted that the UNESCO resolution urges “respecting the status quo of its religious sites, including the al-Aqsa Mosque compound that continues to be threatened by the systematic incitement and provocative actions of the Israeli government and extremist Jewish groups.” 
Earlier this month, UNESCO’s 58-member Executive Board approved a similar resolution, prompting a furious reaction from Israel as the regime suspended its ties with the agency. 
Wednesday’s vote further infuriated Israel, with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu announcing that the regime’s ambassador to UNESCO, Carmel Shama-Hacohen, had been recalled for consultations. 
""We will decide what the next steps will be,” Netanyahu said in a statement. 
Elias Sanbar, Palestine’s UNESCO envoy, fired back at those upset with the resolution and warned that Israelis were “politicizing religion and this is very dangerous."" 
Makram Mustafa Queisi, Jordan’s ambassador to UNESCO, also stressed that UNESCO tried to tackle the issue from a “technical point of view” while many parties were politicizing it.

Palestine became the 195th full member of UNESCO in October 2011, triggering a cut in Tel Aviv’s funding to the agency. 
The occupied territories have already been the scene of increased tensions ever since the Israeli regime imposed restrictions on the entry of Palestinian worshipers into the al-Aqsa Mosque compound in August 2015.

UK announces new troop deployment near Russia's borders,"Military British Defense Secretary Michael Fallon (Photo by AFP) 
British Defense Minister Michael Fallon says the UK is set to deploy hundreds of troops to the Baltic region in Europe to support its NATO allies in the face of a “more assertive Russia.” 
Fallon told a NATO ministerial meeting in Brussels on Wednesday that Britain would send 800 soldiers to Estonia to fulfill its pledge to deliver one of four battalions to NATO’s Enhanced Forward Presence in Eastern Europe. 
“Backed by a rising defense budget, this deployment of air, land and sea forces shows that we will continue to play a leading role in NATO, supporting the defense and security of our allies from the north to the south of the alliance,” Fallon said. 
NATO had announced in July that it would deploy, on a rotational basis, four multinational battalions to Poland and the Baltic states—Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania—to deter what it referred to as “any Russian incursion.” 
During his address at the meeting, Fallon also said that four British Typhoon fighter jets would be dispatched to Romania under the NATO Southern Air Policing mission, which is supposed to protect the Baltic states' airspace against possible attacks from Russia. 
“This is about two things: reassurance, and that needs to be done with some formidable presence, and deterrence,” Fallon had said in an earlier interview. “This is not simply a trip-wire….This is a serious military presence.” 
The move is likely to draw criticism from Moscow, which has been angered by NATO’s military buildup on its Western borders. 
The US-led military alliance cut its ties with Moscow in 2014 and has been reinforcing its presence near Russia’s borders ever since. 
The UK and Russia have strong disagreements over a number of issues, mainly the conflicts in Syria and Ukraine. 
The two countries’ military forces have been involved in a series of aerial and naval confrontations, with Britain sending its jets and warships on several occasions to intercept Russian bombers and naval fleets. 
The latest of those encounters occurred on Thursday, when the Russian aircraft career Admiral Kuznetsov and its seven-ship task force were “shadowed” by two British warships on a course to sail through the North Sea and English Channel, on their way to Syria. Loading ...",1
Pakistan army says Indian troops killed two civilians in Kashmir,"Pakistani troops are seen in a village near the Line of Control (LoC) in Pakistan-administered Kashmir, October 1, 2016. (Photo by AFP) 
Pakistan’s army says Indian troops have killed two civilians in the disputed region of Kashmir. 
A military statement said on Wednesday that “unprovoked” firing by the Indian forces took place along the “working boundary,” which separates Pakistan’s Punjab province from Indian-controlled Kashmir. 
The two were killed in the village of Chaprar, the statement said, adding that ""eight civilians were also injured by the Indian fire."" 
Separately, a Pakistani civilian who was injured due to an earlier cross-border shelling succumbed to injuries on Wednesday. 
The Pakistani military said, ""Another civilian... who was injured by the Indian firing at Line of Control (LoC) Monday (October 24), succumbed to injuries today."" 
Tensions have been running high along the Line of Control, which divides the two neighbors in Kashmir. Pakistani villagers show the wall of a house damaged by heavy mortar shells fired by Indian troops in the border village of Chaprar on October 24, 2016. (Photo by AFP) 
The Pakistani Foreign Ministry summoned a senior Indian diplomat to lodge a protest ""over the unprovoked firing by India on the LoC and the working boundary on October 25 and 26."" 
The ministry called on India to ""instruct its troops to respect the ceasefire"" and ""refrain from intentionally targeting the villages and maintain peace."" 
Relations between the two countries have plummeted in recent months, with India blaming Pakistan for a raid on an army base in Indian-controlled Kashmir in September that killed 19 soldiers. New Delhi responded with what it called ""surgical strikes,"" infuriating Islamabad. 
Kashmir has been divided between India and Pakistan but claimed in full by both since the two countries gained independence from Britain in 1947. 
India and Pakistan agreed to a ceasefire in Kashmir on November 26, 2003, and launched a peace process the following year. Since then, there have been sporadic clashes, with the two sides trading accusations of violating the ceasefire along their de facto border. Loading ...",1

"US spy chief gives false intel on Syria to Obama, Clinton: Analyst","Interviews James Clapper, Director of US National Intelligence Agency, speaks at the Council of Foreign Relations in New York City on October 25, 2016. (AFP photo) 
James Clapper, the US director of national intelligence, has warned that the establishment of a no-fly zone in Syria could prompt Russia to shoot down US planes. This comes as Hillary Clinton, the Democratic nominee for the 2016 US presidential election, has called for establishing a no-fly zone in the Arab country. Russia has recently deployed mobile S-400 and S-300 missile batteries to western Syria, which are ready to shoot down cruise missiles and aircraft. 
Gordon Duff, a senior editor with the Veterans Today, told Press TV that James Clapper who spoke out against former secretary of state’s emphasis on a no-fly zone over Syria is responsible, because the American officials obtain their intelligence on the Syrian conflict from the spy chief. 
“The public position of the United States vis-à-vis Syria was established based on intelligence supplied exclusively by James Clapper,” Duff noted, adding, “He (Clapper) is the one that talks about the gas, he’s the one who talks about the barrel bombs, [and] everything that’s been disproven.” 
He said, “Every crazy scheme that the US comes up with to blame Syria for killing its own people or the Russians for slaughtering people in hospitals, it all comes from James Clapper, the director of the National Intelligence Agency, who fed that information to Secretary Clinton, who fed that information to President [Barack] Obama.” 
“Clinton said that she favored a no-fly zone only if acceptable for both Russia and Damascus and after negotiations,” which is a very different story than the one said by the spy chief for political purposes, Duff said. 
Duff added that the imposition of “no-fly zone obviously is going to help no one but al-Nusra [Front] and ISIS (Daesh)” terrorists. 
Damascus and Moscow carry out airstrikes against terrorist groups who wreak havoc in the Arab country, but the US and its allies push for imposing a no-fly zone on Syria to pursue their agenda in the war-ridden state. 
Since March 2011, Syria has been gripped with foreign-backed militancy, which has left hundreds of thousands of people dead or wounded and millions of others homeless. Loading ...",1

Clashes have erupted outside South Africa's parliament as police struggled to disperse students protesting against financial hardships and the deteriorating economic situation in the country. 
The protest on Wednesday outside the national assembly building in Cape Town saw a direct confrontation between the police and about 2,000 students. 
The protesting students were mainly angry at the increased tuition fees in the universities. They also voiced anger at South Africa’s grim economic prospects. 
Other cities across the country have seen similar protests over the past weeks, some of them violent. Officials in Cape Town, Johannesburg and elsewhere have even ordered the temporary closure of the universities to calm down the situation. An injured student is helped by classmates during a protest outside the parliament in Cape Town, South Africa, October 26, 2016. (Photo by Reuters) 
The clashes on Wednesday came as Finance Minister Pravin Gordhan delivered a speech in the parliament to warn about South Africa’s weakening economy, although he vowed that the government would do anything to help students in the country cope with financial problems. 
“We will do everything that is possible to regain normality on our campuses. We want the violence to stop,” Gordhan said, adding, “Many students face financial hardships that undermine their ability to succeed academically.” 
Gordhan said South Africa’s 2016 growth forecast stood at 0.5 percent. He also stated that an extra 17 billion rand ($1.2 billion) would be earmarked for funding university students. 
He warned that a growing sense of political uncertainty in South Africa could seriously harm the country’s financial position in the world. 
“Much more disturbing, and more difficult, is the rise in our own communities of anger and discontent, spilling over into violence and destructive protests,” Gordhan said, adding, “It is not just that our economic outlook is distressed, and there is the possibility of downgrades in credit ratings.” 
Gordhan’s promise of spending cuts and fighting corruption has triggered a new political stand-off in South Africa. He has been ordered to appear in court on November 2 to face charges of fraud in what many see as a direct clash between him and people loyal to President Jacob Zuma. The minister enjoys a good deal of public support over his record in office. 
Some senior members of Zuma’s African National Congress (ANC) have dismissed charges against Gordhan as politically motivated, calling on Zuma and the ANC’s senior figures to resign to save the party from the current political turmoil. Loading ...",1

Saudi commits crimes on global scale with US green light: Houthi,"Yemen This still shows Abdul-Malik al-Houthi, the leader of Yemen’s Houthi Ansarullah movement, delivering a televised speech. (file photo) 
The leader of Yemen’s Houthi Ansarullah movement says Saudi Arabia commits crimes across the globe with the US green light. 
Abdul-Malik al-Houthi said on Wednesday that the Al Saud family has adopted a hypocritical approach in the Muslim world, the proof of which is Takfiri violence gripping the region. 
""When Washington gives the Riyadh regime the green light, sedition sparks in all countries, with the Saudi offensive being in line with such a trend,"" he added. 
The Houthi leader also warned that Saudi Arabia is seeking to damage security in some Arab countries such as Egypt, Yemen, Syria and Iraq through petrodollars and deceptive propaganda works. 
Instead of countering the enemies of Islam, including the US and Israel, the kingdom has been engaged in spreading Takfiri ideology and arming terrorists, Houthi noted. 
'Saudi has Yemenis’ blood on its hands' 
On October 8, in one of the deadliest attacks Yemen, Saudi warplanes bombarded a funeral hall packed with mourners in Sana’a, killing over 140 people and injuring at least 525 others. 
Human Rights Watch, a New York-based rights group, said that the Sana’a bombing constitutes an apparent war crime, while Amnesty International said the attack was a reminder of the need for the suspension of arms sales to Saudi Arabia.

Saudi Arabia committed crimes by the Sana’a attack, but it tried to acquit itself of the assault, Houthi said, adding that there was no clear sign suggesting an end to the Saudi offensive. 
He also stressed that Yemenis cannot rely on the United Nations as the world body has not adopted a position regarding the Saudi attack in Sana’a. 
Houthi further wished victory for the Palestinian nation and the resistance front in Lebanon and Syria as well as the Iraqi people in their anti-terror operation in the city of Mosul. 
The Riyadh regime resumed its deadly airstrikes on Yemen on Sunday hours after a three-day truce in the conflict-ridden country expired. 
Yemen has seen almost daily military attacks by Saudi Arabia since late March 2015, with the UN putting the toll from the aggression at more than 10,000. 
The offensive was launched to crush the Houthi Ansarullah movement and its allies and reinstate the former Yemeni government. The US has been providing logistic and surveillance support to the kingdom in the bloody military campaign. Loading ...",1

Refugee death toll in Mediterranean hits record high in 2016: UN agency,"EU In this October 21, 2016 photo provided by Sea-Watch aid group refugees sit in an inflatable boat, background left, while a speedboat labeled Libyan Coast Guard, background right, and Sea-Watch members in a boat foreground arrive off the Libyan coast in the Mediterranean Sea. (Via AP) 
The UN refugee agency, also known as the UNHCR, says the number of refugees who died in the Mediterranean Sea on their way to Europe in 2016 has reached an all-time high. 
""We can confirm that at least 3,800 people have been reported dead or missing in the Mediterranean Sea so far this year, making the death toll in 2016 the highest ever recorded,"" said the UN refugee agency spokesman, William Spindler, on Wednesday. 
The alarming surge, which surpassed the death toll of 3,771 for 2015, comes despite a considerable decline in the number of refugees crossing the Mediterranean in 2016. 
More than a million people reached Europe via the Mediterranean in 2016, while fewer than 330,000 crossings have been reported so far this year. 
The number of refugees heading to Europe has declined as the European Union in March signed a controversial deal with Turkey aimed at stemming the flow of refugees into the continent by forcing those deported from the EU to either be located in Turkey or go back to the original country of departure. 
Since then, the route between Libya and Italy across the central Mediterranean has become the main way as pathways to Greece have been closed down. 
According to the agency, the likelihood of perishing in the shorter route between Turkey and Greece was one in 88, while one death for every 47 arrivals was reported in the most perilous route between Libya and Italy in 2016. 
The UNHCR attributed the surge mainly to the overcrowded “lower quality vessels, flimsy inflatable rafts” often used by smugglers. In this October 21, 2016 photo provided by Sea-Watch aid group refugees sit in an inflatable boat off the Libyan coast in the Mediterranean Sea. (Via AP) 
25 refugees found dead in Mediterranean Sea, MSF says 
Earlier on Wednesday, Doctors Without Borders, known as the MSF by its French acronym, said 25 bodies had been retrieved from a refugee boat during a rescue operation in the Mediterranean. 
The MSF said its ship, Bourbon Argos, found the bodies aboard the vessel 26 nautical miles off Libya late on Tuesday. The vessel was carrying 107 survivors. The victims had apparently been burned, suffocated or drowned. 
The recovery operation, which took place with the help of a team from the Berlin-based non-governmental organization Sea-Watch, took a long time as the boat was flooded with a mixture of fuel and seawater. 
""The mixture of water and fuel was so foul that we could not stay on the boat for long periods. It was horrible,"" said Michele Telaro, the MSF project leader. 
The MSF also saved 139 people aboard another dinghy on Tuesday. Sea-Watch recovered a body in another operation. 
The Italian Coast Guard reported that 500 refugees were rescued from overcrowded boats on Tuesday. 
Most of the asylum seekers that have triggered the unprecedented influx of refugees Europe has been dealing with over the past few years flee conflict-ridden zones in North Africa and the Middle East, particularly Syria.

Carter: US laying groundwork for Raqqah offensive,"Foreign Policy US Secretary of Defense Ashton Carter (Photo by AFP) 
US Defense Secretary Ashton Carter says the Pentagon is planning a ground offensive to oust the Daesh (ISIL) terrorist group from the Syrian city of Raqqah, the terror group’s stronghold in the country. 
Speaking to NBC News on Wednesday, Carter said Washington was ready to equip Syrian and Kurdish fighters to launch the assault in the near future. 
“It starts in the next few weeks, hat has long been our plan and we will be capable of resourcing both [groups],” the Pentagon chief noted. 
Carter, who was in Iraq earlier this week amid the ongoing battle to retake the city of Mosul from Daesh, said the Raqqah offensive would begin when Iraq’s second largest city is cleared. 
The Iraqi army, backed by volunteer forces, has been engaged in a large military offensive to cleanse Mosul of Daesh terrorists since last week. A coalition of US-led countries has been reportedly providing air support to the operation. 
“It's been long a part of our plan that the Mosul operation would kick off when it did. This was a plan that goes back many months now and that Raqqah would follow soon behind,” Carter added. Iraqi forces gather in the al-Shura area, south of Mosul, October 24, 2016. (Photo by AFP) 
Carter acknowledged that US forces won't be directly involved in any of the operations. 
More than 5,000 American soldiers are currently stationed in Iraq, tasked with providing training and intelligence to Iraqi forces, according to US military officials. 
The US-led coalition has also been carrying out airstrikes against purported Daesh positions in Syria since 2014. 
However, the ongoing Western efforts in Syria have a different nature. Washington and its allies have come under fire for openly seeking to remove President Bashar al-Assad from power. 
Amnesty International, a UK-based rights group, said Wednesday that the US-led airstrikes have killed hundreds of civilians across Syria. 
Carter’s remarks came only a day after British Defense Secretary Michael Fallon said UK special forces will soon resume training “moderate” militants in Syria to bolster the fight against Daesh. 
The new effort would be an extension of a failed $500 million program by the Pentagon that was supposed to “train and equip” up to 5,000 militants every year, but was discontinued in November last year, after failing to attract enough volunteers. 
Russia, which has been pounding Daesh across Syria upon a request from Damascus, says the Western-trained militants’ only use is to oust Assad. Loading ...",1

Iran’s Zarif to hold talks with Russia’s Lavrov on Syria in Moscow,"Politics Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif (Photo by AP) 
Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif will pay an official one-day visit to Russia for talks on the Syrian crisis. 
Iranian Foreign Ministry Spokesman Bahram Qassemi said on Wednesday that the top diplomat is due in Moscow on Friday. 
He said that Zarif is scheduled to attend a trilateral meeting with his Russian counterpart, Sergei Lavrov, and Syrian Foreign Minister Walid al-Muallem on regional developments, including the conflict in Syria. 
According to Qassemi, Zarif will also hold a separate meeting with Lavrov to discuss Tehran-Moscow relations. 
Meanwhile, Russia's RIA news agency, citing the Russian Foreign Ministry, reported that Zarif and Lavrov will also discuss the situation in Iraq. 
Muallem's scheduled visit on Friday had earlier been announced by the Russian Foreign Ministry. 
Iran and Russia have similar stances on the ongoing deadly crisis in Syria. Moscow and Tehran reject any foreign interference in the affairs of the war-hit country, stressing that only the Syrians are entitled to decide their own fate. 
Iran has been providing military advisory assistance to the Syrian government in its campaign against terrorism. 
Russia has also been carrying out airstrikes against terrorists' positions in Syria since September last year at the official request of the Damascus government. 
Syria has been gripped by foreign-backed militancy since March 2011. Over 400,000 people have so far been killed in the conflict, according to estimates by UN Special Envoy for Syria Staffan de Mistura . 
In neighboring Iraq, the Arab country’s army is also pressing ahead with a massive operation aimed at recapturing Mosul from Daesh Takfiri terrorists, who captured the strategic city in June 2014. 
The army has been liberating more areas aroundMosul, with the Iraqi Joint Operations Command announcing that counter-terrorism units were only two kilometers away from the city. Loading ...",1
Egypt court upholds life sentence for Brotherhood leader Badie,"Egypt The file photo shows Mohammed Badie, a senior figure of Egypt's now outlawed Muslim Brotherhood. 
Egypt's Appeals Court has upheld a draconian life sentence that was handed down to Mohammed Badie, the spiritual leader of the now outlawed Muslim Brotherhood. 
The court ruled on Wednesday that Badie, along with 36 others, who served as ministers in the government led by the country's first democratically elected president, Mohamed Morsi, who was supported by the Brotherhood between 2011 and 2013, deserved life behind bars for inciting violence and murder. 
Badie has been viewed as a key element in the Muslim Brotherhood, a party which operated under numerous restrictions during the era of the country's former dictator, Hosni Mubarak. The senior Brotherhood figure played a major role in the popular uprising that led to the ouster of Mubarak in January 2011. 
During the Wednesday session, the court also upheld the death sentences for 10 other individuals, who had been tried in absentia. 
A criminal court in 2014 tried 47 defendants, who include former youth and supplies ministers, for charges of murder, attempted murder, resisting authorities, assaulting policemen, sabotage, and blocking a main road in the Nile Delta city of Qalyubia. 
The general legal procedure against the Muslim Brotherhood began in July 2013, when Morsi was ousted in a military coup. The head of the Egyptian armed forces, Abdel Fattah el-Sisi, came to power afterward. Sisi is believed to have orchestrated the coup as well as the ensuing crackdown on the Brotherhood. 
Estimates provided by human rights campaigners show that 1,400 people have been killed and 22,000 have been arrested in relation to the crackdown on the members and supporters of the Muslim Brotherhood. 
Morsi himself has been sentenced to 20 years in jail for escaping prison in 2011. The Appeals Court endorsed the sentence last week, rejecting his appeal. Loading ...",1

Saudi killing of Yemeni people worst type of terrorism: Ayatollah Khamenei,"Politics Leader of the Islamic Revolution Ayatollah Seyyed Ali Khamenei (R) and Finnish President Sauli Niinistö meet in Tehran on October 26, 2016. (Photos by leader.ir) 
Leader of the Islamic Revolution Ayatollah Seyyed Ali Khamenei says Saudi Arabia’s killing of Yemenis is ""the worst type of terrorism."" 
“Terrorism is not limited to terror acts committed by some unofficial groups, and mass killings of people by certain governments, such as the Saudi attack on people in a mourning procession in Yemen, which left hundreds killed and injured, are the worst type of terrorism,” the Leader said in a meeting with visiting Finnish President Sauli Niinistö in Tehran on Wednesday. 
Ayatollah Khamenei also described terrorism as one of the “painful” sufferings gripping the human society, and called for a sincere fight against the scourge. 
“Countering terrorism needs the serious resolve of all those who have an influence within global powers,” the Leader said, calling on world pundits and governments to take measures to deal with the phenomenon. Leader of the Islamic Revolution Ayatollah Seyyed Ali Khamenei (R) receives Finnish President Sauli Niinistö (C) in the presence of Iran’s President Hassan Rouhani in Tehran on October 26, 2016. 
Ayatollah Khamenei also said the US and certain Western countries are not sincere in the fight against terrorism. 
“These governments calculate all issues based on their own interests, and they do not think about eradicating the malady of terrorism in Iraq or Syria,” the Leader added. 
Ayatollah Khamenei further criticized UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon’s failure to condemn the Saudi war on Yemen. 
“The UN secretary general said explicitly that it is not possible for the body to condemn the killing of Yemeni children as the UN depends on the Saudi government’s money,” the Leader said, stressing that this approach is indicative of the “deplorable moral state” of politicians at the helm of international organizations.

US secretly using Tunisia airbase for drones spying on Libya: Sources,"Military An MQ-9 Reaper remotely piloted aircraft flies by during a training mission November 17, 2015 at Creech Air Force Base in Indian Springs, Nevada. (Photo by AFP) 
The US military forces have secretly been using an airbase in Tunisia for drone operations to gather intelligence from inside oil-rich Libya, officials say. 
The announcement was made by unnamed sources cited in a Washington Post report on Wednesday. 
Libya has been struggling to contain the Daesh Takfiri terrorists, who started expanding their presence in the country following the overthrow and death of longtime dictator, Muammar Gaddafi, in 2011. 
The base has apparently been in use since late June in an alleged effort to support the Libyan government’s fight against the terrorists currently in control of the northern city of Sirte. 
The US has also been using bases in Niger and Djibouti but those ones are farther away. 
Efforts by the administration of President Barack Obama to Access the airbase were meant to keep drones and small Special Operations teams within striking distance of the militants and close a “blind spot” for US and Western spy agencies. 
The officials also asserted that the drones were unarmed and tasked with gathering intelligences, adding, they could be armed in the future if Tunis agrees. 
The Tunisian government is yet to issue a possible response to the report. 
Drones tasked with assassination in the North African country usually fly out of Naval Air Station Sigonella on the Italian island of Sicily. 
The reason for keeping use of the airbase secret has been mentioned as part of the Obama administration efforts not to harm Tunisia’s “young democracy,” as put by the Washington Post . 
Washington conducts targeted killings through remotely-controlled armed drones in several African and Middle Eastern countries. 
The United States claims the airstrikes target members of al-Qaeda and other militants, but according to local officials and witnesses, civilians have been the victims of the attacks. 
The airstrikes, initiated by former US President George W. Bush, have been escalated since Barack Obama took office in 2009. 
International organizations and human rights groups say the airstrikes flout international law. Loading ...",1

Tens of thousands of pro and anti-government protesters have gathered on the streets of Venezuela's capital Caracas. 
During Wednesday’s mass rallies, in which over 20 people were injured and 39 were detained, the opponents accused President Nicolas Maduro of violating the constitutional order and blocking a recall referendum aimed at removing him from power. 
They also called for his immediate resignation. Opposition supporters take part in a rally against Venezuela's President Nicolas Maduro next to a poster of him in Caracas, Venezuela, October 26, 2016. (Photo by Reuters) 
“This is a way of pressuring Maduro so he understands that he has to go,"" said one protester. ""Being passive is no use anymore. We have to apply more pressure,"" another one added. 
Meanwhile, large numbers of pro-government protesters gathered near the Miraflores presidential palace in a show of support for Maduro. 
As the protests were being held, Maduro engaged in crisis security talks in reaction to the demonstrators’ demands. In a televised speech after the talks, he called for ""political dialogue and peace in Venezuela.""

Maduro is adamant about Washington's role in his country’s political and economic woes, and has accused the opposition of conspiring with the US against the South American country. 
""They are desperate, they have received the order from the north to destroy the Venezuelan revolution,"" he added. 
On Tuesday, Maduro accused the opposition of attempting a “parliamentary coup” by voting to launch an impeachment process against him. 
“There has never been a parliamentary coup in Venezuela, and we shall not allow anything like this to happen, the right-wing here and there should know this,” Maduro said during a massive rally by his supporters outside the presidential palace.

British Prime Minister Theresa May is facing growing criticism over her comments about Brexit at a leaked private speech to Goldman Sachs. 
The premier, who has publicly made the case for a hard Brexit following a June referendum, speaks of the “benefits” of being an EU member in the hour-long session, whose audio file was leaked to the Guardian on Tuesday night, drawing harsh criticism on Wednesday. 
“I think the economic arguments are clear. I think being part of a 500 million [population] trading bloc is significant for us. I think, as I was saying to you a little earlier, that one of the issues is that a lot of people will invest here in the UK because it is the UK in Europe,” she is heard saying. “If we were not in Europe, I think there would be firms and companies who would be looking to say, do they need to develop a mainland Europe presence rather than a UK presence? So I think there are definite benefits for us in economic terms.” 
The leader of the rival Labour Party, Jeremy Corbyn, attacked the prime minister for having failed to address her own concerns about leaving the European Union. 
Corbyn has previously been calling on the Tory-held government for a clear plan to exit the bloc.

(Photo by AFP) 
“The prime minister has given her private views on Brexit to Goldman Sachs bankers, but refuses to give the British people a clear plan for negotiations,” said the Labour leader. “It shouldn’t take a leaked tape for the public to find out what she really thinks.” 
The former Labour leader and leading member of the Open Britain campaign group, Ed Miliband, also reacted to the comments, saying, the leaked comments prove that May shares the concerns of all the Britons on Brexit. 
“If private warnings are to be matched by proper public debate, it is essential that the government is not allowed to hoard vital analysis of the impact on our economy of leaving the single market. This work is being done in government and it must now be published,” he said, asserting that May’s comments “demonstrated that the prime minister was just as worried privately as the rest of us are publicly about the economic impact of the hard, destructive Brexit her government seems set on.” 
According to the Guardian , the audio file was leaked as May was “prioritizing cutting immigration over staying in the single market, while refusing to elaborate any further on her plans for taking the UK out of the EU.” British Foreign Minister Boris Johnson leaves the weekly cabinet meeting at 10 Downing Street in London on October 25, 2016.

In an unpublished newspaper column written before the June 23 referendum for the Telegraph , UK Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs Boris Johnson, who is another Leave campaigner in the public, also defended remaining an EU member. 
“This is a market on our doorstep, ready for further exploitation by British firms. The membership fee seems rather small for all that access. Why are we so determined to turn our back on it?” he wrote, calling the EU a “boon for the world and for Europe.” Loading ...",1

Israeli troops have razed to the ground at least three houses in the East Jerusalem al-Quds, in the latest demolition of Palestinian property in the occupied territories. 
Local media reported that Israeli forces demolished the buildings in the neighborhoods of Beit Hanina and Silwan on Wednesday without prior notice, displacing at least 44 Palestinians including children. 
The United Nations has documented a dramatic rise in demolitions, saying 124 Palestinians, including 60 children, were left homeless in the occupied West Bank in a single day in April. 
The UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) also said in August that a total of 726 Palestinian structures had been razed in the occupied West Bank and East Jerusalem al-Quds since January, and that the demolitions had affected 1,020 Palestinians. 
The world body noted that there were 533 demolitions and 688 displaced Palestinians in the entire 2015, meaning that demolitions so far this year have increased more than 36 percent. This picture taken on March 14, 2011 shows a general view of a construction site in the West Bank settlement of Modiin Illit. (Photo by AP) 
The demolitions have raised alarm among diplomats and human rights groups over Tel Aviv's sustained violation of international law. The demolished structures include houses and schools. 
The Israeli razing of Palestinian homes along with its illegal settlement expansion in the occupied Palestinian territories have dimmed hopes of any peace in the region. 
Over half a million Israelis live in more than 230 illegal settlements built since the 1967 Israeli occupation of the West Bank, including East al-Quds. The settlements are considered by the international community as illegal. 
The occupied territories have witnessed increased tensions ever since Israeli forces imposed restrictions on the entry of Palestinian worshipers into the al-Aqsa Mosque compound in East Jerusalem al-Quds in August 2015. 
Nearly 250 Palestinians have lost their lives at the hands of Israeli forces since the beginning of last October. Loading ...",1
Theresa May refuses to withdraw support for Saudi Arabia,"Foreign Policy During a debate at the House of Commons in Parliament on Wednesday, British Prime Minister Theresa May shunned answering the call of Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn to end the country's weapons sales to Saudi Arabia. 
British Prime Minister Theresa May has refused to withdraw support for Saudi Arabia’s place at the UN Human Rights Council despite the regime’s atrocities in Yemen. 
During a debate at the House of Commons in Parliament on Wednesday, May shunned answering the call of Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn to end the country's weapons sales to Saudi Arabia. 
""The issues are being investigated… We are very clear that the only solution that is going to work for Yemen is actually to make sure that we have the political solution that will give stability in Yemen,"" May told Corbyn and the parliamentarians. 
Instead of answering the direct question, May spoke about the UK government’s contribution to the humanitarian aid provided to the crisis-torn country. 
Corbyn also questioned May’s support for Saudi Arabia’s membership in the UN Human Rights Council. A crucial vote on the membership of Riyadh in the council will take place later this month.

London has repeatedly been blamed by human rights groups, including Oxfam and Amnesty International, for fueling the Yemeni war by supplying Saudi Arabia with weapons. 
Since the conflict began last year, the British government has approved more than £3 billion ($3.7 billion) in arms sales to the Saudis and military contractors hope more deals are in the pipeline. 
Yemen has been under almost daily airstrikes by Saudi Arabia since March 2015. International sources put the death toll from the aggression at almost 10,000. 
Rights groups have also condemned the Kingdom’s crackdown on dissent and prosecution of pro-reform activists. Loading ...",1
Iran’s carpet exports to US at $50mn,"Iran’s carpet exports to US at $50mn Thu Oct 27, 2016 5:55AM Economy Iran says it exported about $50 million of hand-woven carpets to the United States since the removal of sanctions in January. 
Iran says its exports of hand-woven carpets to the United States have reached around $50 million since the removal of sanctions in January. 
Hamid Kargar, head of the Iran National Carpet Center, told Reuters that Iran was under pressure in the US market by rivals such as like India, Pakistan and Turkey during the years that the sanctions were in place. 
Kargar emphasized that the world’s largest buyer imported more than $80 million worth from Iran in 2010, before the trade embargo on the country was tightened. 
He emphasized that a growth in exports of hand-woven carpets will have a positive impact on the lives of the carpet weavers in the country. 
There are almost 1 million carpet weavers in Iran, 700,000 of whom are working full-time, Kargar said. 
Between March and September this year, Iran exported $134 million worth of handmade carpets, or 2,330 tons, to 80 countries, Reuters said. That was a 17.7 percent increase in value and 10 percent rise in weight compared to a year earlier. 
During the sanctions years, Iran partially compensated for its loss of market share in the United States and Europe by finding new buyers in Russia, China, South Africa and some Latin American countries, the report added. It still holds about 30 percent of the global trade in handmade carpets, Kargar further told Reuters. 
Iran shipped its first cargo of hand-woven carpets – globally considered the crown jewel of its handicrafts industry – to the US in February after the sanctions against the country were lifted. 
The cargo was sent to Los Angeles from Hamburg. Loading ...",1
Cypriot leaders to continue talks in November: UN,"EU UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon (C) meets with Greek Cypriot President Nicos Anastasiades (L) and Mustafa Akinci (R), the Turkish Cypriot leader, at the UN headquarters in New York, September 25, 2016. (Photo by AFP) 
Cypriot political leaders have agreed to continue talks in Switzerland next month in an attempt to reach an agreement on the reunification of the Mediterranean island country, the United Nations (UN) has announced. 
A UN spokesman, Aleem Siddique, made the announcement on Wednesday, saying Greek Cypriot President Nicos Anastasiades and Turkish Cypriot leader Mustafa Akinci will meet at Mont Pelerin, near Lake Geneva, from November 7 to 11. 
Siddique said the two leaders, in the presence of the UN envoy for Cyprus, will concentrate their talks on how much territory each side will administer under an envisioned federation and will discuss all other outstanding issues, too. 
The leaders have expressed hope that the Switzerland meeting “will pave the way for the last phase of talks in line with their shared commitment to do their utmost in order to reach a settlement within 2016,” the UN spokesman said. 
Negotiations on reuniting the Mediterranean island under a single federal roof have made significant headway since Anastasiades and Akinci resumed talks led by the UN nearly 18 months ago. 
However, important differences still remain on the question of territorial arrangements, security and property rights. 
Previous UN-mediated talks to reunify the Mediterranean island faced a deadlock in October 2014 when Turkey announced plans to search for oil and gas in waters off Cyprus. 
Cyprus has been divided since 1974, after an intervention by Turkey, which came when a military coup was carried out by individuals who sought to unify the island with Greece. 
Nearly one decade later in 1983, Turkish Cypriots declared an independent state, which has only been recognized by Ankara. Turkey has some 35,000 soldiers stationed in the north of that part of Cyprus. 
Cyprus has been a European Union (EU) member since 2004, but only the south enjoys full membership benefits. Loading ...",1
The Syria conundrum - Press TV,"On The News Line ©AFP 
These are some of the headlines we are tracking for you in this episode of On the News Line: 
The Syria conundrum 
The crisis in Syria is getting more complicated. Many parties are participating in the war. The administration of US President Barack Obama has been talking about sending more sophisticated weapons to the so-called moderate rebels in Syria. But the White House is hesitant and the plan seems to have stalled. The Turks are after for their own agenda in Syria. It’s been almost two months since Turkey launched its offensive in northern Syria. According to Ankara, the mission is aimed at clearing its border area of ISIL militants and anti-Turkey Kurdish militants. And that has put Turkey on a collision course with the US, which has invested heavily on the Kurdish fighters. 
EU threat of disintegration 
Things seem to be falling apart in Europe which many believe is under strain from many factors ranging from the Brexit to the rise of the far-right across the European political spectrum to the refugee crisis, which is the worst to hit the continent. The prospect of the European Union seems so bleak that it has rung the alarm in Germany. German Foreign Minister Frank-Walter Steinmeier has warned: ""The financial crisis, the refugee influx into Europe and the shock from the Brexit referendum in Great Britain have brought the European Union into violent turmoil.” Steinmeier warned that this might lead to the collapse of the EU. 
Saudis aim to starve Yemenis 
Reports have surfaced that Saudi Arabia is ""deliberately targeting impoverished Yemen’s farms and agricultural industry."" Increasing evidence suggests that the kingdom is not merely bombing civilians, but it is systematically targeting infrastructure survivors will need to avoid starvation when the war is over. That includes water infrastructures, and even farms. Loading ...",1
PressTV-NATO pushes military buildup plans near Russia,"NATO pushes military buildup plans near Russia Wed Oct 26, 2016 6:7AM EU NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg speaks during a news conference at the alliance’s headquarters in Brussels, Belgium, October 25, 2016. (Photo by Reuters) 
The North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) is pushing for its biggest military buildup near Russian borders, as the Western military alliance continues to harbor perceptions of a Russian “threat” since the days of the Cold War. 
NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg will discuss the plan for military deployments to the Baltic states and eastern Poland at a two-day meeting of NATO ministers in Brussels on Wednesday. 
The military alliance aims to send “battle groups” to the Baltic states and Poland early next year. The groups will consist of 40,000 forces. It will be the biggest military buildup near Russia since the Second World War. More forces would also be deployed if necessary. 
“This is credible deterrence. Not to provoke a conflict, but to prevent conflict,” Stoltenberg claimed contradictorily on Tuesday, referring to the planned deployments near Russia. “Concrete proof that NATO can and will deploy thousands of forces to support our allies. And a clear demonstration of our transatlantic bond.” 
The United States, Germany, Britain, and Canada have already agreed to contribute forces to the “battle groups,” which are to be deployed to Poland, Lithuania, Estonia and Latvia.

France, Denmark, Italy and other NATO members are expected to contribute forces of their own but have been reluctant so far. 
Anti-Russia by default 
Russia had previously warned that it would take unspecified measures to respond to the increased activities by the Western military bloc. 
It also moved nuclear-capable missiles to its westernmost region of Kaliningrad, near its border with the Baltic countries and NATO member states earlier this month. The Iskander-M cruise missiles are capable of hitting targets across Poland and the Baltics. 
NATO was formed during the Cold War as a means of countering the former Soviet Union. 
The military alliance suspended all ties with Moscow in April 2014, after the then-Ukrainian Crimea Peninsula voted in a referendum to join Russian territory. 
Shortly afterwards, an armed conflict broke out in eastern Ukraine, areas inhabited by an ethnically-Russian population. The Ukrainian government, which militarized the originally peaceful unrest in the regions — known as the Donbass — has ever since been accusing Russia of having a hand in the conflict there. Moscow denies the claim. 
The conflict has so far claimed the lives of more than 9,200 people and left over 21,000 others injured. Loading ... ",1

PressTV-Scotland warns of Brexit implications,"Foreign Policy Scotland's Secretary of State David Mundell (Photo by AFP) 
Scottish Secretary of State David Mundell has warned about the consequences of the UK’s withdrawal from the European Union (EU), saying Brexit would cut access to the single market. 
Mundell told members of the Scottish Parliament on Thursday that neither Scotland nor any other part of the UK was going to get a “special deal” during the negotiations with the EU. 
""So there are very specific issues to specific industries, but there won't be special deals and it's absolutely wrong to characterize a suggestion that certain areas of the country will get a special deal and Scotland will not,” he said. 
“I accept on one level, if we are leaving the EU then essentially we are leaving the single market but access to the single market can, I think, continue in a way that doesn't involve tariffs or barriers,” the secretary continued. 
British and Scottish officials have long been engaged in a war of words over the Brexit process, with Scotland asking for an “equal” role in the negotiations. 
During an EU referendum on June 23, Scotland voted 62 percent to 38 percent to remain in the 28-member bloc, but Britons voted to leave, 52 percent to 48 percent. 
British Prime Minister Theresa May has made it clear that she will complete the Brexit process by 2019 and that Scotland holds no veto over it. 
Scotland, in response, has threatened to secede from the UK in order to preserve its EU membership, which in turn guarantees the nation’s access to the EU single market. 
Last year, Scotland’s first attempt for independence from the UK was blocked by voters in a referendum. 
Mundell told MSPs that the possibility of a second referendum was already harming Scottish businesses, even more than Brexit. 
“It is already evident, because I understand that the surveyors organization have said there is a drop off in the take up of commercial property in Scotland,” he said. 
Experts warn that in case of a hard Brexit, the UK may lose its preferential access to the EU's single market and suffer from soured relations with other EU members. Loading ... ",1

"772 Daesh terrorists killed, 23 captured since start of Mosul operation: Iraq","Iraq Iraqi forces gather near the village of Sin al-Dhuban, south of Mosul, on October 27, 2016, during an operation to retake the city from Takfiri Daesh militants. (Photos by AFP) 
Iraq’s Joint Operations Command (JOC) has announced that more than 700 Takfiri militants have been killed and nearly two dozen others arrested ever since government forces and allied fighters launched a massive operation to dislodge the terrorists from the northern city of Mosul. 
A total of 772 Daesh terrorists have been killed and 23 others arrested since the offensive to liberate Mosul, located some 400 kilometers north of the capital Baghdad, was kicked off on October 17, the JOC said in a statement released on Thursday. 
The statement added that 127 car bombs, 27 makeshift mortar launchers, seven explosive belts and a large weapons cache were also destroyed during the mentioned period. 
Furthermore, four booby-trapped houses, 397 explosive devices and five motorcycle bombs were blown up, while three tunnels, a command center for terrorists, 40 defensive fighting positions, seven airstrike-resistant bunkers and three Dushka heavy machine guns were destroyed. 
The JOC statement added that 1.5 tons of ammonium nitrate, nine 120mm mortar rounds, 380 mortar shells, 61 Katyusha rockets, 31 missile launchers, three PK machine guns and four anti-tank rocket-propelled grenade launchers were also confiscated. Iraqi pro-government forces hold a position near the village of Sin al-Dhuban, south of Mosul, on October 27, 2016, during an operation to retake the city from Takfiri Daesh terrorists. 
The Iraqi forces also destroyed four cannons, seized a caravan and four heavy machine guns and discovered two bomb-making workshops. 
Also on Thursday morning, Iraqi security forces managed to retake the village of Wadi al-Qasab in al-Shoura district and al-Hamza village in Hammam al-Alil district, both south of Daesh-held Mosul. 
Separately, the Iraqi Defense Ministry announced that 12 Daesh extremists were killed when fighter jets from the so-called US-led military coalition struck Mosul's al-Arabi neighborhood. 
Fifteen Daesh terrorist were also killed and two others injured when US-led military aircraft targeted a gathering of the militants in Suwayrah village of al-Shoura district, the ministry added. 
Mishraq sulphur factory extinguished 
In another development on Thursday, the Iraqi forces put out a fire at the Mishraq sulphur factory, located about 30 kilometers south of Mosul. This file photo taken on October 22, 2016 shows Iraqi forces attempting to extinguish flames after Daesh militants torched the Mishraq sulphur plant, near the Qayyarah base and about 30 kilometers south of Mosul. 
Last week, Daesh militants set the factory on fire in a bid to prevent army and security units from making advances. 
There are reports that about 50,000 Iraqi ground troops are involved in the Mosul offensive, including 30,000 army troops, 10,000 Kurdish Peshmerga fighters and the remaining 10,000 from police and Popular Mobilization Units. 
International aid agencies have warned that the military operation to retake Mosul has displaced about 10,600 people from their homes. 
“Assessments have recorded a significant number of female-headed households, raising concerns around the detention or capture of men and boys,” said Lise Grande, the UN humanitarian coordinator for Iraq, on Tuesday. 
She noted that a huge exodus of people from Mosul could occur within the next few days, warning that Daesh terrorists could resort to “rudimentary chemical weapons” as part of efforts to hold up government forces. Loading ...",1
Sanders calls Trump 'political coward' over voter suppression report,"Politics US Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton listens as Senator Bernie Sanders (I-VT) speaks during an event at University of New Hampshire September 28, 2016 in Durham, New Hampshire. (Photo by AFP) 
Former US Democratic presidential candidate Senator Bernie Sanders has denounced Republican nominee Donald Trump as a “political coward” over a voter suppression report. 
Sanders condemned Trump after a report that the Republican's presidential campaign has three ""voter suppression"" drives intended to lower turnout for Hillary Clinton, the Democratic presidential nominee, and to help Trump winning the White House. 
""Anybody who is suppressing the vote because they know that those people will vote against them is a political coward,"" the Vermont senator tweeted. 
“If you don’t have the guts to run for office on your ideas @ realDonaldTrump , then you shouldn’t run for office at all,” he said in another tweet. 
A senior adviser to Trump acknowledged in an interview with Bloomberg Businessweek that the Republican team has ""three major voter suppression operations underway."" 
Sanders – a former primary rival of Clinton – suspended his campaign in July and endorsed the former secretary of state, despite leaked emails that showed top officials at the Democratic National Committee (DNC) privately planned to undermine Sanders’s presidential campaign. 
Sanders had earlier said that he would not endorse Clinton for president until they meet and he could measure her commitment to combating wealth inequality, and other issues that powered his presidential campaign.

US election claims against Russia expose Clinton: Analyst,"Interviews US First Lady Michelle Obama (L) listens as Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton speaks during a campaign rally in Winston-Salem, North Carolina, on October 27, 2016. (Photo by AFP) 
The United States government is trying to distract people from the true nature of Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton by accusing Russia of influencing the election against her. 
Don DeBar, a New York-based author and radio host, made the remarks in an interview with Press TV on Thursday, following Russian President Vladimir Putin’s response to Washington’s accusations of sponsoring hacking attacks against the US. 
Speaking to foreign policy experts during a Valdai Discussion Club meeting in Sochi, southern Russia on Thursday, Putin said Washington was using Russia as a distraction to cover the fact that this year’s White House contenders had nothing to offer on real issues. 
“The subject matter of what is being revealed here is definitely an action item that defines who Clinton is,” DeBar said. 
“Also, the thing that is really galling is the fact that we are told to ignore the content, and the content is something that goes to the heart of governing and also to the heart of Clinton’s record,” the analyst noted. 
“This is the person who was married to the guy who signed in ‘three strikes and you are out legislation’ for people to get life in prison if they are convicted of three felonies,” he said. “If you look at the things that have been revealed here, some of the acts are themselves the violations of three separate federal criminal sanctions.” 
DeBar argued that Clinton has multiple sets of the triple violations and yet is freely allowed to run for office under federal protection. 
Clinton and her campaign have repeatedly claimed that Russia was trying to rig the November election in favor of Republican nominee Donald Trump. 
During the last presidential debate last week, Clinton accused Trump of having secret ties with Moscow, saying that Putin would love to see a “puppet” in the White House. 
DeBar dismissed accusations against the Russian president, but noted that since the US was openly seeking regime change in Russia, it is only logical for Russia to fight back. 
Based on that argument, DeBar said: ""It warrants support and not condemnation” even if Russia was trying to fight back in a way or another. Loading ...",1

UAE welcomes UN peace plan to end crisis in Yemen,"Yemen UAE Minister of State for Foreign Affairs Anwar Gargash (Photo by Reuters) 
The United Arab Emirates, a key Saudi ally in its deadly aggression against Yemen, has welcomed a new United Nations peace proposal to end the Yemen conflict. 
""The UAE supports the efforts of UN [Special] Envoy [for Yemen] Ismail Ould Cheikh Ahmed knowing that the mission of a mediator is always tough,"" Minister of State for Foreign Affairs Anwar Gargash said on his Twitter account on Thursday. 
The remarks came two days after the UN envoy submitted the plan to Yemen’s Houthi Ansarullah movement and its allies. 
According to informed sources, the roadmap urges agreement on naming a new vice president after the withdrawal of Houthis from the capital Sana’a and other cities and their handover of arms to a third party. 
The initiative further calls on former Yemeni president, Abd Rabbuh Mansur Hadi, to transfer power to the vice president who would appoint a new premier to form a government. United Nations Special Envoy for Yemen, Ismail Ould Cheikh Ahmed, speaks to reporters at Sana’a airport following his visit to the Yemeni capital on October 25, 2016. (Photo by Reuters) 
“The roadmap represents a political solution for the Yemeni crisis,” Gargash said, adding, “UN efforts represent a chance to bring Yemenis back to the political track. Other alternatives are gloomy.” 
The Hadi administration, however, said that it had not received any roadmap for a political settlement. 
Peace talks, which were held between Yemen’s opposing parties in Kuwait, ended in deadlock in August. 
Earlier this week, Ahmed made a visit to Sana’a, where he held meetings with Yemen’s warring sides and called for a return to a cessation of hostilities to allow aid deliveries. 
The Riyadh regime resumed its deadly airstrikes on Yemen on Sunday hours after a three-day truce in the conflict-ridden country expired. 
Yemen has seen almost daily military attacks by Saudi Arabia since late March 2015, with the UN putting the toll from the aggression at more than 10,000. 
The offensive was launched to crush the Houthi Ansarullah movement and its allies and reinstate the former Yemeni government. 
The Houthi Ansarullah fighters took state matters in their own hands after the resignation and escape of Hadi, which threw Yemen into a state of uncertainty and threatened a total security breakdown in the country, where an al-Qaeda affiliate is present. Loading ...",1

Police have raided a youth convention for opposition leader Imran Khan's Pakistan Tehreek Insaaf (PTI) party in the capital, Islamabad, arresting dozens of activists ahead of a planned protest. 
Images on local news channels showed police in uniform beating activists with batons and leading those detained away to waiting buses. 
""All of a sudden police arrived and started arresting people,"" media outlets quoted Anila Khawaja, a spokeswoman for PTI as saying. 
Several PTI leaders and lawmakers have been infuriated by the police raid. 
""The government has proved that there is no democracy in Pakistan, it is a monarchy,” Asad Umar, a PTI lawmaker, told reporters from the scene. 
A spokesman for the Islamabad district administration said the raid was enforcing the order issued earlier in the day by the city's top administrator which outlawed gatherings of more than five people. 
The Thursday raid came hours after a city order banned all public gatherings ahead of Khan's planned protest set to begin on November 2 in Islamabad. Khan, a former Pakistan cricket star who turned politician, has described the upcoming mass protest as a final push to force Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif to resign over corruption allegations.

Khan led a previous mass protest in the summer of 2014 in front of parliament, calling for the government to resign over election rigging allegations. 
Khan has insisted that his anti-government protests would continue until the Sharif administration offers an appropriate response to the corruption allegations. 
Leaked confidential documents from the Panamanian Mossack Fonseca law firm have showing how the company helped rich and powerful clients across the world with shady businesses. 
The clients reportedly included three of Sharif's children, who carried out business transactions which could be judged as money laundering and tax avoidance.

"US charges 61 over India-based scam involving 15,000 victims","Society The US is charging dozens of people with participation in a major Indian-based fraud. 
The US Justice Department has charged 61 people and entities with involvement in a major India-based scam that targeted thousands of Americans. 
The scheme involved Indian call centers, where some workers called American citizens and convinced them to pay their non-existent debts by impersonating Internal Revenue Service (IRS), immigration and other federal officials, the Justice Department said in a statement on Thursday. 
Some victims were even offered short-term loans or grants on condition of providing good-faith deposits or payment of a processing fee. 
The scammers had stolen more than $300 million from at least 15,000 unsuspecting citizens, the department noted. 
The victims’ money was laundered by an American network of criminals who used debit cards or wire transfers under fake identities, the indictment said. 
Federal officials arrested 20 people across America on Thursday. Additionally, 32 individuals and five call centers in India were charged with connection to the case. 
US Assistant Attorney General Leslie Caldwell said in a press briefing that Washington was looking forward extraditing the suspects from India to face jail terms. 
“It's really important for the scammers in India to know that the United States is looking at this, is watching them and they could, if they engage in that activity, be extradited to the United Sates and could sit in jail ... for several years,” she said. 
In a bill of indictment for the scammers, the US District Court for the Southern District of Texas had pointed to scare tactics employed by the operators of call centers in Ahmedabad, in the Indian state of Gujarat. 
They “threatened potential victims with arrest, imprisonment, fines or deportation if they did not pay taxes or penalties to the government,” it read. 
The extent of the scam was so vast that major federal organizations such as Immigration and Customs Enforcement, Treasury, Homeland Security, US Secret Service and police had to help with the investigation, according to the Justice Department. Loading ...",1
"Polls are tightening, but is the US presidential election rigged?","Interviews US Democratic presidential nominee former Hillary Clinton boards her campaign plane at Westchester County Airport on October 27, 2016 in White Plains, New York. (Photo by AFP) 
One of the most important questions is will US Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton rig the election to win the White House like she did in the primaries against Bernie Sanders, asks Myles Hoenig, an American political analyst and activist. 
Recent polls show that Clinton’s national lead over Trump is shrinking as the Election Day is approaching. 
The former secretary of state has the support of 49 percent of likely voters, while the billionaire businessman has 44 percent support, according to the CNN/ORC survey released on Monday. 
Libertarian candidate Gary Johnson has 3 percent support among likely voters, while Green Party nominee Jill Stein has 2 percent support. 
“In every election the race tightens towards the end,” Hoenig told Press TV on Thursday. 
“It’s really hard to imagine that there is any flux in this election as the supporters of both sides absolutely hate the other. With Obama and Romney, or even Gore and Bush, many of the issues were shared and the voting was often done on personalities or the historical nature of a first black president, regardless of who was pulling whose strings,” he said. 
“This election is more polarized than ever. With the Podesta leaks showing Clinton’s overt racism (calling Donna Brazille a buffalo) as well as proving that President Obama lied to the public about when he learned of Clinton’s inappropriate use of her emails, and with the news of Trump’s ACCESS Hollywood tape receding into America’s short term memory span, it’s no wonder the polls are tightening,” the analyst stated. 
“The question of the day is will Clinton rig the election like she did the primary, being the only way she could have won,” he asked. 
“We’re also seeing both Johnson’s and Stein’s numbers dropping but so many are not polled that those numbers are harder to verify,” the commentator noted.

Syrian army soldiers and their allies have managed to liberate a key town in the country’s west-central province of Hama from the grip of Takfiri terrorists. 
An unnamed Syrian military source said on Thursday that the recapture of the town of Suran came after intensive operations against the gatherings and fortified positions of terror outfits in the area. 
“Units from our armed forces in cooperation with the people’s defense forces regained control over the municipality of Suran and the farms surrounding it,” the source said. 
He also noted that the clashes prior to the town’s liberation left a large number of terrorists dead and many more injured, destroying their armored vehicles as well as cars equipped with machine guns. 
Members of the Syrian army’s engineering units are detonating explosive devices and mines planted by militants to prevent the Syrian forces’ advance, he added. 
Over the past few weeks, the Syrian forces have wrested control of several areas across the war-torn country as they press ahead with their counter-terrorism operations. 
Since March 2011, Syria has been hit by militancy it blames on some Western states and their regional allies. Backed by the Russian air cover, the Syrian military is engaged in an operation to rid the country of Daesh and other terrorist groups. 
The so-called Syrian Observatory for Human Rights and United Nations Special Envoy for Syria Staffan de Mistura have put the death toll from the Syria conflict at more than 300,000 and 400,000, respectively. 
This is while the UN has stopped its official casualty count in Syria, citing its inability to verify the figures it receives from various sources. Loading ...",1
Knife-wielding man shot dead outside US embassy in Nairobi,"More Unidentified armed US embassy personnel stand guard and inspect the body of a man who was killed outside the US embassy in Nairobi, Kenya, October 27, 2016. (Photo by AP) 
An African man has been shot and killed after he reportedly attacked and injured a police officer outside the US embassy in Kenya’s capital, Nairobi. 
“The man was shot dead after a confrontation with officers guarding the embassy,” a police source said Thursday on condition of anonymity, without specifying the cause of the confrontation. 
National police spokesman, George Kinoti, said the man was killed by the police officer in self-defense. 
“It was a lone criminal who attacked a police officer,” Kinoti said, adding, “He was armed with a knife.” 
Fiona Evans, a US embassy spokeswoman, confirmed there had been a “shooting incident” outside the mission, adding that “no embassy personnel were involved,” without giving further details. 
The US embassy in Nairobi is located in a heavily-fortified compound opposite the main UN complex in Gigiri, an upmarket suburb in the city’s north. 
The police officer involved in the incident was a member of the paramilitary General Services Unit deployed to guard the embassy. 
Kenyan media reported the police officer had been guarding one of the secured entrances to the embassy compound when he was assaulted. 
Kinoti described the slain man as a criminal, but refrained from giving any motive for the attack. 
He said an investigation has been launched into the shooting. Loading ...",1
US hacking ‘hysteria’ aimed at distracting voters: Putin,"Foreign Policy Russian President Vladimir Putin gives a speech at a Valdai Discussion Club meeting of political scientists in Sochi, October 27, 2016. (Photo by AFP) 
Russian President Vladimir Putin has dismissed as “hysteria” claims by US officials that Moscow is trying to influence the upcoming presidential election in America. 
Speaking to foreign policy experts during a Valdai Discussion Club meeting in Sochi, southern Russia, on Thursday, Putin said Washington was using Russia as a distraction to cover up the fact that this year’s White House contenders had nothing to offer on real issues. 
“Hysteria has been whipped up in the United States about the influence of Russia over the U.S. presidential election,” Putin said, adding that so far no clear policies have been offered by the US political elite to tackle issues such as national debt and gun control. 
American officials and intelligence agencies have openly accused the Kremlin of sponsoring hacking attacks against the US. 
This is while Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton and her campaign have gone even further, claiming that Russia was trying to rig the November election in favor of Republican nominee Donald Trump. US Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton (L) and Republican nominee Donald Trump 
During the last presidential debate last week, Clinton accused Trump of having secret ties with Moscow, saying that Putin would love to see a “puppet” president in the White House. 
“It's much simpler to distract people with so-called Russian hackers, spies, and agents of influence. Does anyone really think that Russia could influence the American people's choice in any way? Is America a banana republic or what?” Putin asked in his Thursday speech. 
Baffled by the release of a series of hacked emails that have uncovered the inner mechanics of the Democratic Party’s campaign for the election, the White House has stepped up its anti-Russian rhetoric. American officials have even threatened Russia with countermeasures. 
Despite the general belief, however, Trump has on many occasions called on Russia-accusers to either provide their evidence or stop making baseless assumptions about Moscow. 
“I don't know if they're behind it and I think it's public relations, frankly,” the real-estate mogul said Wednesday. “Do you know what bothers me? I have nothing to do with Russia.” 
“People are hacking all over the place and nobody knows. They don't know if it's Russia. They can't guarantee it's Russia, and it may be,” he added. Loading ...",1
Tunisia denies hosting US drones for Libya operations,"North Africa Tunisian Defense Minister Farhat Horchani (C) attends the unveiling of an anti-militant fence in eastern Tunisia, close to the border with Libya, on February 6, 2016. (Photo by AP) 
Military officials in Tunisia have rejected claims that the country is hosting a base for US drone operations against the Daesh Takfiri terrorist group in neighboring Libya. 
Tunisia’s Defense Minister Farhat Horchani on Thursday ruled out any possibility that foreign forces could have direct access to Tunisian military bases or run their own in the country. 
“We don't -- and won't -- have a foreign military base in Tunisia,"" Horchani said, adding, “We were one of the few first countries to oppose a foreign military intervention in Libya.” 
A Tunisian Defense Ministry spokesman also said on Thursday that the North African country has never allowed Washington to operate unmanned planes from its territory for anti-Daesh missions. 
""Tunisian soil has never been and never will be used to strike targets in Libya. The drones are used by Tunisians and no one else,"" Belhassen Oueslati said, adding, ""As part of Tunisian-US bilateral cooperation, we have acquired drones to train our military personnel to use this technology and to control our southeastern border with Libya and detect any suspicious movement."" 
The remarks came after US media claimed that Washington has expanded its deployment of drones to North Africa as part of a secret program. 
A report by the Washington Post said on Wednesday that unmanned aircraft and US military personnel had been deployed to a facility in Tunisia to conduct spy missions in neighboring Libya. The paper added that ""drones began flying out of the Tunisian base in late June,” claiming that the dispatch of the planes was a key element of the extended US air offensive against a Daesh stronghold in Libya. 
Daesh, which is known for its terror acts in Iraq and Syria, has been operating mostly in northern Libya, a country which slipped into chaos in 2011 following the ouster of longtime dictator, Muammar Gaddafi. 
Forces loyal to Libya’s unity government, which enjoy the support of the West and the United Nations, have been battling Daesh militants over the past six months in the coastal city of Sirte. 
US Africa Command (AFRICOM) said on Thursday that since August 1, Pentagon has carried out 351 airstrikes in Libya to help Libyan forces in the fight in Sirte. 
“There are US service members working with the Tunisian security forces for counter-terrorism and they are sharing intelligence from various sources, to include unarmed aerial platforms,” said Colonel Mark R. Cheadle, spokesman for US Africa Command. 
Tunisia, which is frequented by Western tourists, has suffered several major attacks by the Daesh terrorist group. 
Last year, a total of 59 foreign tourists were killed in two such assaults by Daesh on the National Bardo Museum in Tunis and a beach resort. Loading ...",1
NATO chief downplays concerns over formation of joint European army,"EU NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg speaks during a press conference at the organization’s headquarters in Brussels on October 26, 2016. (Photo by AFP) 
NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg has downplayed suggestions that EU military buildup might undermine the Western alliance as the bid to establish an independent European army appears to gain momentum. 
""I strongly believe it is absolutely possible to strengthen European defense without duplicating efforts by NATO,"" Stoltenberg said on Thursday, adding, “EU leaders have (also) conveyed that this is not about the EU doing collective defense, the EU building structures that would compete with NATO."" 
Stoltenberg made the remarks following a meeting between European Union's foreign policy chief, Federica Mogherini, and NATO defense ministers in Brussels. 
Mogherini, one of the strongest supporters of a joint European defense force, has drawn up a global strategy for the bloc, which says the 27-nation bloc should seek ""strategic autonomy"" to face multiple security threats, ranging from conventional to hybrid warfare, from the Ukraine crisis to Syria, from poverty in Africa to massive refugee flows. 
The proposal has sparked concerns that the bloc is seeking a more independent role. 
Mogherini on Thursday said the bloc does have civilian and military operations, such as in Africa or in the Mediterranean, and needs to improve command and control centers to run them. 
She, however, attempted to downplay concerns that the formation of an EU force could lead to the duplication of NATO functions, saying, ""But this can be done ... without any kind of overlapping or duplication with NATO.""

In July, an EU strategy document said that the bloc should look to create greater military autonomy from NATO. It stated the EU could no longer rely on the alliance regarding various security issues and must instead develop an ability to “act autonomously if and when necessary.” 
European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker was the first to call for the establishment of an EU army in March 2015. 
""A joint EU army would show the world that there would never again be a war between EU countries,” he said. 
His suggestion, however, received a cool response from NATO. Loading ...",1

The leader of Iraq’s semi-autonomous Kurdistan region has assured that Kurdish Peshmerga forces will not set foot in Mosul during a joint operation with the army and allied fighters aimed at liberating the Daesh-held northern city. 
“The Peshmerga will not enter the city of Mosul,” Masoud Barzani said in a news conference with Chairman of the Islamic Supreme Council of Iraq (ISCI) Ammar Hakim, in Zartac Mountain, near the city of Nineveh, on Thursday. 
Barzani further said the Kurdish fighters are coordinating their role in the Mosul liberation operation with the Iraqi military, adding that the collaboration will continue. 
The Kurdish leader further highlighted unity among different Iraqi political parties, adding that Daesh was no more a threat as most areas are back in control of the Iraqi forces. 
Last week, the Popular Mobilization Units, a mainly-Shia military group backing the Iraqi army in the Mosul offensive, also said its forces would not march into Mosul, adding that Iraqi army soldiers and security personnel would enter the embattled city. 
Barzani further referred to recent Daesh terror activities in the Kurdish-controlled city of Kirkuk, saying the Takfiri terror group is making desperate attempts to cover up its defeats in the Mosul battle. 
“We were able to control the situation quickly and kill the terrorists,” the Kurdish leader said. 
Terrorists launched several rounds of attacks in the city of Kirkuk over the weekend as Iraqi officials are focused on the Mosul offensive. 
On Friday, at least 100 Daesh elements went on a rampage in Kirkuk to divert an Iraqi and Kurdish military advance on Mosul. The incident left 99 civilians and members of the security forces dead as well as 63 militants, according to Iraqi security officials.

(Photo by Reuters) 
For his part, Hakim highlighted the need for avoiding rifts in Iraq and staying focused on the fight against Daesh. 
He further stressed that a Turkish base present in Bashiqa near Mosul was not welcome. 
“This (Turkish) base, and the forces that came to the base, were present without coordination with the Iraqi government. They are armed forces, and we strongly refuse the participation of any non-Iraqi fighter in this battle,” Hakim said. 
Last December, Turkey deployed some 150 soldiers, equipped with heavy weapons and backed by 20 to 25 tanks, to the Bashiqa camp. 
Ankara claimed the deployment was part of a mission to train and equip Iraqi Kurdish Peshmerga forces in the fight against Daesh, but Baghdad denounced the unauthorized move as a violation of Iraq’s sovereignty. 
Recently, Ankara claimed that his country is involved in the Mosul operation, but Baghdad denied such a role. 
Last week, the Iraqi army, volunteer Shia and Sunni fighters as well as Kurdish Peshmerga forces launched a long-awaited operation to wrest control of Mosul, the last stronghold of Daesh in the Arab country. 
Many believe that the recapture of Mosul, which fell to Daesh in 2014, would signal the terror outfit’s total defeat in Iraq. 
Iraqi Special Forces commanders said Thursday that the Mosul operation was proceeding as planned and they were now waiting for further gains in the south before resuming their push toward the city. 
“The operation has not been stopped and is proceeding as planned,” Special Forces Brigadier General Haider Fadhil said. 
In another development on Thursday, the US estimated that up to 900 Daesh terrorists have been killed in the Mosul liberation operation so far. 
General Joseph Votel, the head the US military’s Central Command, said the operation was taking a heavy toll on the Takfiris. 
There are between 3,500 and 5,000 Daesh elements in Mosul and up to another 2,000 in the broader area, according to US figures. 
More Daesh tunnels uncovered 
Also on Thursday, Iraqi troops discovered several tunnels used by Daesh terrorists in recently recaptured villages of Bartella and Bazwaia, located between 5 and 7 kilometers east of Mosul. 
“When we entered the Khazna Taba neighborhood (in Bartella) and after we liberated it, we found several tunnels,” said Razed Qusai al-Kinani, a member of Iraqi Counterterrorism forces. 
One of the tunnels, which is 200 meters long and 10 meters deep, was used by Daesh for meetings and allowed the terror outfit’s ringleaders to move around during the battle, he added. 
Elsewhere in the village of Tob Zawa, the Iraqi troops found a tire shop that had been converted into a factory for making roadside bombs and attaching armor to vehicles. 
They also discovered another tunnel in the village equipped with fans and lights that ran from beneath a mosque out to a road. Loading ...",1

Trump will win November 8 election: American professor,"Politics US Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump gestures while speaking to a crowd of donors at the McGlohon Theater in Charlotte, North Carolina, on October 26, 2016. (Photo by AFP) 
US Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump will win the November 8 election, says an American professor who has correctly predicted almost every presidential election in the United States. 
Professor Helmut Norpoth, of New York’s SUNY Stony Brook University, said his model shows Trump performed comparatively better in the primaries so he will triumph next month, The Independent reported on Thursday. 
Norpoth developed a model which, when applied retroactively, successfully predicted every presidential election in the United States since 1912 all but one, which was the 2000 election, when it said Democratic nominee Al Gore would beat Republican candidate George W. Bush. But instead Bush won the election. 
Al Gore won the popular vote, but Bush was awarded more votes in the Electoral College following a disputed result in Florida. So Bush was declared winner. 
The political scientist’s model suggests that the person who emerges as the strongest candidate in the primaries will go on to win the presidency. 
“I think he was the strongest candidate in the primaries and that he will prevail,” Professor Norpoth told the New York Post . 
“The model predicted a Trump win in February and nothing has changed since then. Whatever happens in the real world doesn’t affect the model,” he stated. US Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton Professor of Political Science at Stony Brook Helmut Norpoth, New York 
Recent polls show that Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton Clinton’s national lead over Trump is shrinking as Election Day is approaching. 
The former secretary of state has the support of 49 percent of likely voters, while the billionaire businessman has 44 percent support, according to the CNN/ORC survey released on Monday. 
In addition, preliminary figures suggest the US presidential race remains tight in so-called swing states, despite boasting by Clinton’s campaign that she is far ahead. 
Clinton, the Democratic presidential nominee, has an edge in several of the roughly 10 swing states that will decide the 2016 White House race. 
Trump has also potential advantages of his own in some battleground states. 
On Wednesday, Trump said that he would win the key battleground states of Ohio, Florida and North Carolina, that could help him claim the election. ""I think I'm gonna win,"" Trump told ABC News. 
The billionaire said that he intends to pour in millions of dollars in the final days of the campaign. Loading ...",1

The European Parliament has awarded two Iraqi women from the Izadi minority group its prestigious human rights prize. 
On Thursday, Nadia Murad and Lamia Haji Bashar won the European Parliament's prestigious Sakharov Prize for Freedom of Thought for their plight when they, along with other women and girls were abducted, tortured and sexually abused by Daesh terrorists after the militants overran northern Iraq two years ago. 
The two were awarded the prize as part of efforts to protect the Izadis, who are followers of an ancient religion mostly practiced by more than half a million people in northern Iraq. 
The community members, especially women, have been subject to torture, sexual abuse and slavery by Daesh. 
European Parliament chief, Martin Schulz, hailed the two Izadi women for their bravery, saying they had“a painful and tragic story” but “felt compelled to survive to bear witness.” 
""The courage of these two women, [and] the dignity they represent defies all description,” Schulz told the assembly in Strasbourg. This photo taken on May 5, 2016 shows Lamia Haji Bashar, an 18-year-old Izadi girl who escaped Daesh, in northern Iraq. (Photo by AP) 
Daesh abducted Murad from her home village of Kocho near Iraq's northern town of Sinjar in August 2014. The slight, softly-spoken young woman, who is now 23, was then brought to the city of Mosul, where she was tortured and raped. 
Bashar, from the same village, was enslaved and sold two years ago after watching the slaughter of her family and friends by Daesh. The 18-year-old then fell prey to an Iraqi hospital director after 20 months of captivity. She later lost her right eye in a mine explosion which hit one of her friends. 
The annual Sakharov human rights prize honors individuals who combat intolerance, fanaticism and oppression. It is named after dissident Soviet scientist Andrei Sakharov, who died in 1989. Loading ...",1

A court in Bahrain has imprisoned and revoked the citizenship of more than a dozen people after convicting them of terror charges as the ruling Al Khalifah regime continues with its heavy-handed crackdown on political dissidents in the tiny Persian Gulf kingdom. 
On Thursday, the Fourth High Criminal Court convicted two defendants to 15 years in jail and three others to 10 years behind bars each on charges of “forming a terror cell, running it and recruiting new members.” 
Seven other people were slapped with seven years in jail each. Three others, namely Sheikh Mohammad Ali al-Tal, Mohammad al-A'ali and Ismail Abdulaziz, were sentenced to life imprisonment. 
The trio were also ordered to pay a cash fine of 200,000 Bahraini dinars (over $530,000). 
The court later revoked the citizenship of all the 15 defendants. 
Separately, Bahrain's Supreme Criminal Court sentenced two civilians to 5 years in prison on charge of holding an anti-regime protest in the small village of Jurdab earlier this year, and setting scrap tires ablaze. 
Thousands of anti-regime protesters have held numerous demonstrations in Bahrain on an almost daily basis ever since a popular uprising began in the kingdom on February 14, 2011. 
They are demanding that the Al Khalifah dynasty relinquish power and a just system representing all Bahrainis be established. 
Manama has spared no effort to clamp down on the dissent and rights activists. On March 14, 2011, troops from Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates were deployed to Bahrain to assist the Manama government in its crackdown on peaceful protesters. 
Scores of people have lost their lives and hundreds of others sustained injuries or got arrested as a result of Al Khalifah regime’s crackdown on anti-regime activists. Loading ...",1

Libyan forces have launched a fresh offensive against Daesh positions in the Mediterranean port city of Sirte. 
On Thursday, fighters from the nearby city of Misrata, allied with forces of the UN-backed unity government in Tripoli, were pushing their way through the last pockets of resistance in the city’s Ghiza Bahriya District. 
They were supported by tanks and armored vehicles during the renewed offensive. 
“Bonyan Marsous forces and the Libyan army forces are advancing onto Ghiza Bahriya to free it ... The Bonyan [forces] have been advancing in Ghiza Bahriya and thank God there have been no causalities so far, there are only some wounded,"" said Hussien Edra, a member of the Bonyan Marsous Brigade. 
In May, the internationally-backed pro-government troops started a large-scale military operation, including street-by-street fighting backed by heavy airstrikes and artillery fire, to eradicate Daesh militants in Sirte. They have so far recaptured most areas in the city. 
Most of Daesh commanders in the city fled to other places and the remaining rank has been holding out via sniper fire, booby traps and car bombs.

The city fell into the hands of Daesh Takfiri militants more than a year ago after the group extended their reach into North Africa by taking advantage of the chaos gripping Libya.

US Supreme Court justice groped female lawyer in 1999: Report,"Society US Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas 
A female lawyer has accused US Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas of sexually assaulting her in 1999, a report says. 
Moira Smith, who works as a corporate lawyer with an Alaska energy company, said the judge made unwanted sexual advances on her during a dinner party when she was 23-year-old, the National Law Journal reported on Thursday. 
She said Thomas grabbed and squeezed her buttocks several times during the party in Falls Church, Virginia. 
“Justice Thomas touched me inappropriately and without my consent,” Smith said. 
“He groped me while I was setting the table, suggesting I should sit ‘right next to him,’” Smith said. 
“He was 5 or 6 inches down and he got a good handful and he kept squeezing me and pulling me close to him,” she stated, according to the journal. 
In a statement to the National Law Journal, Thomas, 68, dismissed the allegation as “preposterous”, saying that the incident “never happened."" 
Smith, currently vice president and general counsel at Enstar Natural Gas Co in Alaska, said she decided to speak out after hearing Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump's lewd comments about women. 
A 2005 video was released earlier this month by The Washington Post, in which Trump can be heard making lewd comments about women and bragging about groping them. 
A number of women have since come forward claiming that the business mogul has sexually assaulted them. 
Trump has called the allegations “slander and libel” and part of a “concerted, coordinated and vicious attack” by Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton and the news media to undercut his campaign. Moira Smith said Justice Clarence Thomas groped her at her boss' dinner party when she was 23. 
""That willingness by men in power to take advantage of vulnerable women relies on an unspoken pact that the women will not speak up about it,"" Smith, now 41, told the journal. 
""Why? Because they are vulnerable. Because they are star-struck. Because they don't want to be whiners. Because they worry about their career if they do speak out. But silence no longer feels defensible; it feels complicit,” she stated. 
""As the mother of a young daughter and son, I am coming forward to show that it is important to stand up for yourself and tell the truth,"" Smith said.

PressTV-Russia cancels request to fuel ships in Spain,"Russia This photo taken from a Norwegian surveillance aircraft shows Russian aircraft carrier Admiral Kuznetsov in international waters off the coast of Northern Norway on October 17, 2016. (Via Reuters) 
Russia says it has cancelled plans for a fleet of its warships to refuel at a Spanish port on their way to Syria. 
Vasily Nioradze, a spokesman at the Russian embassy in Madrid, said on Wednesday that the request was canceled, without giving further details, the Associated Press reported. 
The Spanish Foreign Ministry also confirmed that Russia had withdrawn its request for the warships to refuel in the Spanish port of Ceuta. 
""The Russian embassy in Madrid has just told us that it is withdrawing its demand for permission to stop over for the boats, which means that the stopovers have been cancelled,"" the ministry said in a statement on Wednesday. 
The development came after Spain, a NATO member state, said it was reviewing Russia's request to refuel its naval fleet at Ceuta after passing through the Straits of Gibraltar en route to Syria, where Russian forces are engaged in an anti-terror campaign in support of the Syrian government. 
In a statement released on Wednesday, the Spanish Foreign Ministry said that Spain had been allowing Russian navy ships to dock in Spanish ports for years, but that it treated such requests on a case by case basis. 
The naval group, which passed through the English Channel on Friday, is made up of Russian aircraft carrier Admiral Kuznetsov, as well as a nuclear-powered battle cruiser, two anti-submarine warships and four support vessels, escorted by submarines. 
The fleet will join around 10 other Russian vessels already off the Syrian coast. 
Ceuta sits on the tip of Africa’s north coast, across the Straits of Gibraltar from mainland Spain, and bordering Morocco. The port is part of the EU, but its NATO status is unclear. Since 2011, at least 60 Russian warships have docked in Ceuta. 
NATO irked by Spain’s announcement 
NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg claimed that the Western military alliance was ""concerned"" by the deployment of the Russian warships. 
""It is each up to each nation to decide, as has been NATO policy for many years, but we are concerned about the potential use of this carrier group to increase attacks… in Aleppo,"" Stoltenberg said, adding, ""All allies are aware of our concerns."" 
Britain echoes NATO’s stance 
British Defense Secretary Michael Fallon also said on Wednesday that London would be ""extremely concerned"" if Spain refueled the Russian carrier group heading through the Mediterranean towards Syria. 
""NATO should be standing together,” he added. 
Since March 2011, Syria has been hit by militancy it blames on some Western states and their regional allies. Russia has been conducting air raids against Daesh and other terrorist groups in the Middle Eastern country at the Damascus government’s request for more than a year now. 
Russia boosts Baltic Fleet 
In another development on Wednesday, a report said that Russia was reinforcing its Baltic Fleet in Kaliningrad with two small warships armed with long-range cruise missiles to counter a worrying NATO build-up in the region. 
The report by Russia's daily Izvestia quoted an unidentified military source as saying that the vessels, the Serpukhov and the Zeleny Dol, had already entered the Baltic Sea and would soon become part of a newly formed division. 
Kaliningrad shares land borders with Poland and Lithuania. 
The deployment comes at a time when NATO is planning its biggest military buildup on Russia's borders since the Cold War. Loading ... ",1

Scientists believe the birds which stop while flying does so only for a moment, and spent 99.5 percent of the 10 months in the air. They save energy during the day by sliding in upward currents of warm air. 
It’s still unclear how the birds sleep during the time. But researchers believe they might catch a few winks when they fly to high heights. Loading ...",1
Yemeni forces fire ballistic missile at Saudi Arabia’s Jeddah airport,"Yemen This photo provided by the media bureau of the operations command in Yemen shows a Borkan-1 (Volcano-1) missile. 
Yemeni army forces and allied fighters from Popular Committees have reportedly launched a locally designed and manufactured ballistic missile towards an area deep inside Saudi Arabia in response to the Riyadh regime’s atrocious aerial bombardments against the crisis-hit Arab country. 
Yemeni soldiers and their allies fired a Borkan-1 (Volcano-1) missile towards King Abdulaziz International Airport, located 19 kilometers north of the western Saudi port city of Jeddah, Arabic-language al-Masirah television network reported. 
A military source, speaking on condition of anonymity, later told the official Saba news agency that the 12.5-meter-long missile had targeted its target accurately and left massive destruction at the airport. 
Saudi media outlets, however, reported that the kingdom’s missile systems intercepted and destroyed the solid propellant and Scud-type missile before it could cause any damage. 
They said the projectile was launched at 9 p.m. local time (1800 GMT) on Thursday from Yemen’s mountainous northwestern area of Sa’ada. 
Also on Thursday, the media bureau of the operations command in Yemen said army soldiers had targeted a gathering of militiamen loyal to resigned president Abd Rabbuh Mansur Hadi in the Aqaba district of the northern province of Jawf, leaving scores of the Saudi-backed armed men dead. Fire rages after a gathering of militiamen loyal to resigned president Abd Rabbuh Mansur Hadi is targeted by Yemeni army forces in the Aqaba district of the northern province of Jawf, Yemen, on October 27, 2016. 
An armored vehicle and battle tank belonging to the mercenaries were also destroyed in the attack. 
Separately, a number of Saudi soldiers were killed and injured when Yemeni forces and Popular Committees fighters struck al-Kars base in Saudi Arabia’s southwestern border region of Jizan. 
Saudi Arabia has been engaged in the deadly campaign against Yemen since March 2015 in an attempt to bring back the former Yemeni government to power and undermine the Houthi Ansarullah movement.

Fastest electric commuter ferry unveiled in Sweden,"Fastest electric commuter ferry unveiled in Sweden Fri Oct 28, 2016 12:49AM News Bulletin The BB Green ferry, powered by LTO batteries. 
World's fastest electric commuter ferry has been unveiled in Sweden. This is a supercharged vessel capable of hitting top speeds of 56 kilometers per hour. The ferry can accommodate around 75 people, plus 15 bicycles. Engineers say its speed, range and low environmental impact will convince commuters to trade their daily drive for a waterborne journey. 
Instead of a chugging motor down in its hull, there's a humming 200 kilowatt hour lithium-ion battery bank. 
Those involved with the project believe the rapidly recharging batteries make it a competitive choice for a number of routes and commuter journeys. 
Key to the ferry's high speed is its unique air supported vessel technology that reduces water resistance by around 40 percent. Using an electric fan system and its unique hull shape, approximately 80 percent of the vessel's weight is supported on a cushion of air. Loading ...",1
Massive marine park declared in Antarctic Ocean,"This undated handout photo received from the Antarctic Ocean Alliance on October 28, 2016 shows a Adelie penguin on pack ice in the Ross Sea in Antarctica. © AFP 
International leaders have joined hands to create the world’s largest marine park in the Antarctic Ocean. The European Union and 24 countries have reached a momentous agreement to open the Ross Sea Park. 
The deal was sealed in Hobart, Australia after prolonged negotiations run by the United Nation’s Commission for the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources. 
The Ross Sea marine park will cover an area of 1.55 million square kilometers and is to be protected from commercial fishing for 35 years. 
The preserved area covers more than 12 percent of the Southern Ocean and is home to more than 10,000 species. Scientists and activists consider the deal a historic milestone after decades of global efforts in marine preservation. 
The Ross Sea is seen as one of the world's most ecologically important oceans for its unique qualities. Scientists believe that the marine park can be a platform for a deeper understanding of climate change impacts. 
The 25-member commission comprised of Russia, China, the US and the EU had to have unanimous support for the decision. Loading ...",1
Comprehensive international resolve key to terror fight: Iran FM,"Politics Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif attends a news conference after a meeting with his counterparts Walid al-Muallem from Syria and Sergei Lavrov from Russia in Moscow, Russia, on October 28, 2016. (Photo by Reuters) 
Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif says comprehensive international determination is necessary to fight and uproot terrorism in the Middle East. 
The Iranian foreign minister made the remarks at the end of a three-way meeting among him and his Russian and Syrian counterparts, Sergei Lavrov and Walid al-Muallem respectively, in Moscow on Friday on the latest situation in Syria. 
Zarif said Tehran, Moscow and Damascus should reinforce their cooperation in the campaign against terrorism. 
He stressed the importance of adopting strategies to stop the delivery of weapons and military equipment to the foreign-backed Takfiri militants wreaking havoc in Syria. 
“The political settlement of the crisis in Syria will be possible through negotiations between the sides in order to put an end to this crisis,” Zarif said. 
The three foreign ministers agreed to intensify the fight against terrorism and said their countries have a common stance on the anti-terror campaign in the region, particularly in Syria. 
Lavrov said Iran, Russia and Syria have determined necessary frameworks for fighting terrorism and expressed their readiness to take measures that will play a key role in the campaign against the malicious phenomenon. 
The Russian foreign minister added that the Moscow meeting highlighted the significance of a firm and efficient battle against terrorism in the Middle East, particularly in Syria. 
He said the meeting’s participants also discussed ways to send humanitarian aid to civilians in Syria and stop the flow of weapons into the hands of terrorists operating in the war-hit country. 
Muallem, for his part, said the US is making no effort to find a political solution to the Syrian crisis. 
The Syrian foreign minister added that a recent agreement between Washington and Moscow, signed in the Swiss city of Geneva in September, failed to bear any fruit. 
After marathon talks in Geneva, US Secretary of State John Kerry and his Russian counterpart reached an agreement on September 10 to impose a ceasefire in the Syrian city of Aleppo and to coordinate military operations against terrorist groups in the country. 
Aleppo, Syria’s second largest city, remains divided between government forces in the west and foreign-backed terrorists in the east, making it a frontline battleground. 
Russia, which has been conducting an aerial military campaign against extremist militants in Syria, has repeatedly voiced its readiness for a ceasefire. Russia has been insisting, however, that any such lull in fighting should be accompanied with a meticulous separation of terrorists from less extremist militants fighting against the Syrian government. 
The Syrian foreign minister said Washington is not interested in solving the crisis in Damascus and takes measures only to serve the its own interests and those of its regional allies. 
Since March 2011, Syria has been hit by militancy it blames on some Western states and their regional allies. Backed by the Russian air cover, the Syrian military is engaged in an operation to rid the country of Daesh and other terrorist groups. 
The so-called Syrian Observatory for Human Rights and United Nations Special Envoy for Syria Staffan de Mistura have put the death toll from the Syria conflict at more than 300,000 and 400,000, respectively. 
This is while the UN has stopped its official casualty count in Syria, citing its inability to verify the figures it receives from various sources. 
Over the past few weeks, the Syrian forces have wrested control of several areas across the war-torn country as they press ahead with their counter-terrorism operations. 
Iran, Russia share strong anti-terror stance: Zarif 
Meanwhile, in a meeting with his Russian counterpart earlier on Friday, the Iranian foreign minister said Tehran and Moscow have “tough stances in the fight against terrorism in the region through common strategies.” 
“Tehran and Moscow have broad cooperation on regional issues such as the campaign against terrorism and extremism and we share views [on these matters],” Zarif added. Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov (R) speaks with his Iranian counterpart Mohammad Javad Zarif during a meeting in Moscow, Russia, on October 28, 2016. (Photo by Reuters) 
He also noted that Iran and Russia have succeeded in making considerable progress in all fields including in economic and political sectors as well as regional and international developments. 
""I am pleased that in recent years relations between the Islamic Republic of Iran and the Russian Federation, as two good neighbors and two key players, have made many positive developments,” Zarif said. 
Lavrov, for his part, said Tehran and Moscow urged cooperation on an unrelenting approach to terrorists operating against the Syrian government. 
Iran and Russia have similar stances on the ongoing deadly crisis in Syria. Moscow and Tehran reject any foreign interference in the affairs of the war-hit country, stressing that only the Syrians are entitled to decide their own fate. 
Iran has been providing military advisory assistance to the Syrian government in its campaign against terrorism. Loading ...",1
'There are many instances’ of voter fraud: GOP VP candidate Pence,"Politics US Republican vice presidential candidate Mike Pence speaks at a rally on October 25, 2016 in Marietta, Ohio. (Photo by AFP) 
US Republican vice presidential candidate Mike Pence says the mainstream media is biased against Donald Trump, and there are “many instances” of voter fraud in the run up to the November 8 election. 
Republican presidential nominee Trump has recently intensified his criticism of the American electoral system. He calls the election process rigged, and says the media is colluding with Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton in order to win the White House. 
He has questioned the legitimacy of the US elections, saying that he believed the vote was already being ""rigged"" at many polling places. 
During his final presidential debate with Clinton last week, Trump declared that he might not accept the results of the November 8 presidential election if there is evidence it was rigged. 
In an interview with CBS News on Friday, Trump’s running mate, Pence, said, “Make no mistake about it, there are many instances in our lifetimes of voter fraud in individual polling places and in certain jurisdictions.” 
“Donald Trump and I are just calling on people to respectfully participate in the electoral process. We want a victory on Election Day, but we also want it to be a victory for American democracy,” he stated. Donald Trump speaks at an event on October 15, 2016 in Portsmouth, New Hampshire. (Photo by AFP) 
The governor of Indiana rejected claims of critics that Trump’s “rigging” rhetoric may encourage violence by his supporters if he loses the presidential election. 
“We certainly would denounce any calls for anything other people being vigorously involved in the electoral process,” he said. 
“I have to tell you, I really don’t see it. The people that rallying around our team, rallying around our cause, love this country, are passionate about this country and are anxious to see change,” the GOP vice presidential nominee stated. 
He went on to accuse the media of unfairly backing Clinton. 
“The level of negative coverage about my running mate in many quarters in the national media has just been overwhelming compared to any negative coverage or frankly the avalanche of scandals coming out of Hillary Clinton’s years as secretary of State,” Pence said.

According to a recent poll released, 41 percent of American voters are saying the 2016 election could be ""stolen"" from Trump due to widespread voter fraud. 
And 73 percent of Republican voters think the election could be stolen from the billionaire businessman, while 17 percent of Democrats agree with the prospect of rigging. 
American writer and political commentator Stephen Lendman told Press TV on October 17 Washington has been rigging elections for nearly 200 years in order to keep anti-establishment candidates away from the White House. Loading ...",1
Five Filipino hostages freed by Somali pirates reunite with families,"More Filipino fisherman Arnel Balbero (R), who was held hostage for nearly five years by Somali pirates, cries as he meets his relatives after arriving at the Manila International Airport on October 28, 2016. (Photo by AFP) 
Five Filipino fishermen who were released after being held hostage by Somali pirates for nearly five years have reunited with their families. 
The seafarers arrived at the airport in the Philippine capital Manila on Friday. 
""I am so happy. This is what I had been praying for every night,"" said Arnel Balbero, 33, as he was embraced by his four siblings at the airport. 
""Just to be with my family, even if we have nothing, even if we have only little to eat, I am already happy,"" he said. 
His sister, Lilia, trembled at the sight of her brother. ""It's like a miracle. We never lost hope he would be freed,"" she said. 
The Filipinos were among 26 freed hostages from Cambodia, China, Taiwan, Indonesia and Vietnam who were freed on October 22. The 26 hostages plus three others made up the crew of Naham 3, which was seized south of the Seychelles in March 2012. 
The captain of their Omani-flagged but Taiwanese-owned vessel died during the hijacking and two other crew members succumbed to illness in captivity. 
Recounting memories 
Balbero's cousin and fellow ex-hostage, Elmer, said the Somali pirates had cared little about the health of their captives. 
""We asked the pirates for medicine but they did not give us any. Instead they said, 'Where is your money?'"" said Elmer. 
The captives also said they suffered beatings at the hands of the pirates. 
""In our first week, they called it our introduction. They used bamboo to beat us,"" Arnel said. 
To survive, the Filipinos did chores for their captors, washing their clothes and even their weapons. 
""We took it as a chance to also wash. We couldn't take a bath often because they only gave us a liter of water each day,"" Arnel said. 
Hugging his two teenage daughters, Elmer said it was thoughts of seeing his family again that kept him going during his captivity. 
Taiwan's Foreign Ministry said the men were freed after a ransom was paid by the ship's owner as well as groups contracted to negotiate with the pirates, Taiwanese media reported. 
John Steed, who works with the Hostage Support Partnership, said the local community and tribal elders were involved in the ""difficult situation."" 
""These are poor fishermen. The ship had no value, they had no insurance, and of course governments don't want to be involved in these sort of negotiations either,"" he said.

The sailors are believed to be among the last remaining captives seized by Somali pirates during the surge in hostage-taking in the mid-2000s. 
Piracy off the coast of Somalia has reduced significantly in recent years due to stronger international naval presence. Loading ...",1
780 Palestinian homes razed in occupied W Bank's Area C in 2016,"Palestine Palestinians check the flat of Amjad Aliwi after Israeli authorities demolished it in the northern occupied West Bank city of Nablus on October 11, 2016. (Photo by AFP) 
A new report has revealed that the number of Palestinian homes demolished by Israeli authorities in the largest division of the occupied West Bank since the beginning of the current year stands at more than 700. 
Israel's Hebrew-language Haaretz newspaper reported on Friday that a total of 780 Palestinian homes have been demolished in Area C of the West Bank, which constitutes about 61 percent of the territory and is under full Israeli military control, since January, leaving 1,129 people homeless. 
That compares to 453 demolitions in the area last year, which left 580 Palestinians without any place of residence. 
The newspaper noted that a total of 125 Palestinian homes have also been destroyed in East Jerusalem al-Quds since the start of the year, up from 78 last year. 
The demolitions affected 164 Palestinians in the region, marking an increase from 108 the previous year. 
The revelations came only two days after Israeli military forces razed three Palestinian homes in the Beit Hanina and Silwan neighborhoods of East Jerusalem al-Quds, displacing at least 44 people, including minors. 
International bodies and rights groups argue that Israel’s sustained demolitions of Palestinian homes and structures in the occupied West Bank and East Jerusalem al-Quds are an attempt by the Tel Aviv regime to uproot Palestinians from their native territories, and confiscate more land for expansion of illegal settlements. 
More than half a million Israelis live in over 230 illegal settlements built since the 1967 Israeli occupation of the Palestinian territories of the West Bank and East Jerusalem al-Quds. 
The presence and continued expansion of Israeli settlements in occupied Palestinian lands have created a major obstacle for the efforts to establish peace in the Middle East. 
The Palestinian Authority wants the West Bank as part of a future independent Palestinians state, with East Jerusalem al-Quds as its capital. Loading ...",1
Iran raps 'rare' EU clauses in trade deals,"Iran raps 'rare' EU clauses in trade deals Fri Oct 28, 2016 1:37PM Economy Asghar Fakhrieh Kashan, Iran’s deputy minister of roads and urban development, has criticized “very exceptional terms and conditions” that Europeans are including in trade deals with Iran. 
A top official in Tehran has accused European government of failing to take the required measures to facilitate trade agreements with Iran – what he says is already in violation of a nuclear agreement that was sealed with the country last summer and came into effect in January. 
Asghar Fakhrieh Kashan, Iran’s deputy minister of roads and urban development, told the Financial Times that European government should prevent the inclusion of what he described as “very exceptional terms and conditions” in trade agreements with Iran. 
Fakhrieh Kashan warned that such terms and conditions were effectively discouraging investments in the Iranian economy. 
He said export credit agencies were specifically demanding premiums on insurance that made banks insist on putting what he described as “unacceptable terms” in contracts related to “political risk” in doing business with Iran. 
Fakhrieh Kashan emphasized that Iran will not accept any clauses in trade agreements which he said foresee such possibilities like snapback sanctions and new sanctions against Iran. 
European businesses, he said, are in fact trying to devise deals in which political risks are inserted alongside commercial risks – what he said is totally rejected by the Islamic Republic. 
If anyone needed guarantees against political risks, it was Iran, Fakhrieh Kashan said in reference to the impact of western sanctions on the Iranian economy. 
“Why should Iran accept very exceptional terms and conditions in its contracts with European companies? This is not called a normal relationship,” he said. 
Fakhrieh Kashan emphasized that European countries should take the adequate measures to prevent their businesses from including political risk in contracts, warning that any failure to do so will be against the nuclear agreement with Iran. 
“This is where European countries are failing to be committed to the nuclear agreement. One of the main reasons the signing of contracts in various sectors has been delayed is this issue.” 
Last summer, Iran signed a historic deal with the US, Britain, France, Russia, China and Germany – the so-called P5+1 group - based on which it agreed to restrict certain aspects of its nuclear energy activities. The P5+1 in return agreed to lift certain economic sanctions imposed against the Islamic Republic. Loading ...",1
Myanmar reports first Zika case in pregnant woman,"More A Nicaraguan Health Ministry worker fumigates a house to kill mosquitoes during a campaign against dengue and chikungunya and to prevent Zika infection in Managua, October 27, 2016. (Photo by Reuters) 
Myanmar has confirmed its first case of the mosquito-borne Zika virus in a pregnant foreign woman in the country's largest city of Yangon. 
Authorities confirmed the infection in the 32-year-old foreign woman ""yesterday following a laboratory test,"" the Global New Light of Myanmar said on Friday. 
The director of Myanmar's public health department, Soe Lwin Nyein, said in a news conference that the woman was the country's ""first Zika victim."" 
He further said the woman, whose nationality he declined to disclose, had been living in Myanmar for several years. 
Zika symptoms may include fever, rash, joint pain, and conjunctivitis, and when pregnant women are infected, it can lead to microcephaly, causing severe brain damage in babies.

The virus, which was first identified in Uganda in 1947, is spreading across the world and has currently reached 72 countries and territories, according to the United Nations. 
There is no vaccine for Zika and efforts to eliminate the virus by using insecticides to kill carrier mosquitoes have resulted in the death of honey bees. 
Earlier this month, the World Health Organization warned that the virus may further spread in Asia, saying the Asia Pacific region is expected to report ""new cases and possibly new outbreaks of Zika."" Loading ...",1

More than 5,200 refugees have died across the world since the beginning of 2016, says the International Organization for Migration (IOM). 
The organization, which is based in Geneva, said on Friday that of a total of 5,238 deaths, 3,930 people died trying to cross the Mediterranean Sea by boat, indicating a 170-person increase compared to 2015. 
On Wednesday, the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) made a different account with more than 3,800 deaths in the Mediterranean since January, also noting that it was a new record compared to 2015. 
Over 280 asylum seekers trying to reach the European Union died off the Libyan shores recently, according to the IOM. 
The EU said on Thursday it had begun training the Libyan coast guard how to curb the influx of asylum seekers. 
“Today we are starting the training of the Libyan coast guard in Operation Sophia which is a very important step,” said the EU foreign affairs chief, Federica Mogherini, as she arrived for a meeting with NATO defense ministers in Brussels. 
NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg said the Western military alliance had just launched its own Operation Sea Guardian in the Mediterranean to help support Operation Sophia. 
The EU launched Operation Sophia last year after hundreds of asylum seekers died when their rickety boats sank off southern Italy. 
The central Mediterranean route has seen more asylum seekers risk their lives in recent months after the EU reached an accord with Turkey in March to halt an influx of refugees crossing the Aegean to reach Europe. 
Stoltenberg further said within two weeks ships and aircraft would be provided by NATO allies to help back up Operation Sophia. Loading ...",1
Iran to resume gas exports to Turkey soon,"Iran to resume gas exports to Turkey soon Fri Oct 28, 2016 12:10PM Energy Iran says it will resume exports of natural gas to Turkey by Monday after an explosion in the Turkish territory halted the supplies on Thursday night. 
Iran says its exports of natural gas to Turkey that have been halted reportedly as a result of an explosion inside the Turkish territory will resume within the next few days. 
Sadeq Akbarpour, the head of Gas Exports Measurement Facilities at Iran-Turkey Border, told the domestic media that the required coordination is being carried out with the Turkish Botas company to resume Iran’s exports by next Monday. 
Akbarpour emphasized that Iran is ready to supply Turkey with its required gas whenever it voices its readiness. 
Majid Bojarzadeh, the spokesman of the National Iranian Gas Company (NIGC), also told Iran’s Shana news agency that Ankara had informed Tehran of a problem in the pipeline that carried Iranian gas into Turkey on Thursday night. 
Furthermore, Majid Aqababaei, the director general for border affairs of Iran’s Interior Ministry, acknowledged, as reported by Shana, that an explosion near Iran’s border had caused the problem. 
Iran is Turkey’s second supplier of gas after Russia, providing one-fifth of the country’s consumption. The current volume of natural gas that Iran is piping to its northwestern neighbor is 30 million cubic meters per day (mcm/d). Officials in Tehran had already emphasized that the Islamic Republic is ready to increase its gas exports to Turkey by 6 mcm/d. 
Iran has also for long been working on a plan to export its natural gas to Europe through Turkey. The plan – that was to be carried out though the Nabucco scheme – was eventually put on hold due to a series of technicalities. Nevertheless, officials in Tehran announced last month that the possibility that gas exports to Europe would return to the agenda exist “if the requited agreements with Europeans countries over the plan are reached”.

Thailand’s economic future,"Economic Divide People pay respects to late Thai King Bhumibol Adulyadej near the Grand Palace in Bangkok, October 28, 2016. (Photo by AFP) 
The passing away of Thailand’s king has put the country into an uncertain state. The military junta, which has been in power after a coup, has announced one year of mourning. That will affect one of the largest industries in Thailand, namely tourism. 
Thailand’s economy was sluggish to begin with. Ever since the coup, retail business activity has experienced a slump, the agriculture industry has been hit with falling commodity prices, and exports, which accounts for 70% of Thailand’s GDP, has dropped five percentage points.

Tony Blair suggests a second referendum to reverse Brexit,"Politics Former British Prime Minister Tony Blair says UK voters ‘have to build the capability to mobilize and to organize’ against Brexit. 
Former British Prime Minister Tony Blair says Britain should keep its “options open” on whether or not to leave the European Union until after Brexit talks with the bloc are completed. 
During an interview on Friday with BBC Radio 4's “Today” program, Blair described the EU referendum as “a catastrophe” and said UK voters should be given the option of a second EU referendum. 
Britain should not withdraw from the EU until it becomes clearer how Brexit would impact UK’s economic, social and cultural future, Blair said. 
""The bizarre thing about this referendum is that we took a decision but we still don't know the precise terms,” he said. “There’s got to be some way, either through parliament, or through an election, possibly through another referendum, that people express their view.” 
The former premier, who was in office from 1997 until 2007, said it should be possible for the public to switch their verdict if it becomes clear the alternative negotiated by Prime Minister Theresa May is going to be worse. 
Blair’s argument contrasts sharply with that of May, who has repeatedly said that “Brexit means Brexit” and that she’ll respect the referendum result. Blair had argued that Britain should stay in the EU before the referendum. 
Economic growth in the UK is expected to slow significantly next year, due to uncertainty over of the Brexit vote. 
Experts have warned that leaving the EU will severely hurt London’s position as a financial hub, unless the UK decides to keep its access to the single EU market by loosening its stance on immigration. 
If the UK loses its access to the EU’s single market, the resulting increase in the costs of doing business and exporting to the EU would hurt Britain’s competitive position in Europe. Loading ...",1
West covering up crimes of Bahraini regime: Analyst,"Interviews A protester throws a glass bottle containing paint at a police armored personnel carrier during anti-regime demos in the village of Sitra, south of Manama, February 14, 2016. (Photo by Reuters) 
The Fourth High Criminal Court of Bahrain has sentenced 15 political opponents to long jail terms and also revoked the citizenship of all of them. While several international rights groups have criticized the Al Khalifa regime’s harsh crackdown on the Bahraini opposition, the Western powers turn a blind eye to the Arab state’s violations of human rights. 
Edward Corrigan, an international human rights lawyer, told Press TV’s Top 5 program that the Western powers are trying to whitewash the crimes committed by the Arab dictatorships in the Persian Gulf region because such regimes are considered the West’s “lap dogs.” 
“There is a double standard,” Corrigan said, explaining that Western powers say, “‘If you are a friend of ours and do what we want and give us oil and invest your money into European or American economy, we won’t question your human rights violations.’” 
According to the analyst, “There is hypocrisy, double standards and this is really a big political game. Our dictatorships and allies are OK but somebody else that we don’t like for whatever reason, we magnify their crimes and even create false flags and do other things to try to discredit them.” 
Elsewhere in his remarks, Corrigan said the definition of terrorism in Bahrain covers any kind of opposition, because the regime does “not want to allow any sort of political movements there to try to reform the system, to redress this massive discrimination against the Shia population, and to have any sort of voice for democracy; so, all of that is ‘terrorism.’” 
He added, “It is against the international law to remove people’s nationality from them and this is an extreme sort of punishment, very draconian, as they’re condemned by the international human rights organizations and other organizations.” 
Manama has been cracking down on dissent since February 2011, when an uprising began against the regime. Scores of people have lost their lives and hundreds of others sustained injuries or got arrested as a result of Al Khalifah regime’s harsh crackdown on anti-regime activists. Loading ...",1
Daesh abducts 1000s near Mosul to use them as human shields: UN,"Iraq Civilians leave their homes as Iraqi troops fight against Daesh militants in the village of Tob Zawa. (Photo by AP) 
Daesh terrorists have abducted tens of thousands of civilians from near Mosul to use them as human shields as government forces inch closer to the city proper in an operation to retake it, the UN says. 
UN human rights spokeswoman Ravina Shamdasani said the terrorist group also killed at least 232 people on Wednesday, including 190 former Iraqi security forces and 40 civilians, who refused to obey its orders. 
“Many of them who refused to comply were shot on the spot,” Shamdasani said in Geneva, citing reports corroborated by the UN that were “by no means comprehensive but indicative of violations.” 
As the news emerged, Iraq’s Hashd al-Shaabi volunteers said they were set to launch an offensive against Daesh west of Mosul imminently. 
Ahmad al-Assadi, a spokesman for the popular forces, confirmed that the fighters had completed preparations to move in the direction of Tal Afar, a Daesh-held city 63 kilometers west of Mosul. 
He added that the fighters would move to capture Tal Afar from their positions in the Iraqi town of Qayyara, situated some 60 kilometers south of Mosul. 
“A few days or hours separate us from the launch of operations there,” Asadi said. 
Iraqi forces liberated three key areas from Daesh terrorists east of Mosul. Army officials said troops also seized a tank and artillery from the terrorists, and found a two-kilometer-long tunnel full of ammunition. 
The army is edging closer to Mosul by liberating villages around the city. Nearly 80 Daesh-held towns and villages have been retaken by the army since the Iraqi forces began the battle to liberate Mosul last week. Loading ...",1
Militant shelling kills at least 15 civilians in western Aleppo,"Syria This file photo shows smoke rising from western Aleppo after militant shelling. 
At least 15 civilians are killed and some 100 others injured as foreign-backed militants shell western Aleppo after launching a massive offensive to break the Syrian government's siege over the city. 
A UK-based monitoring group sympathetic to the militants said hundreds of shells and rockets had fallen on various western neighborhoods of the city on Friday. 
Militant groups involved in the attack include Turkey-backed FSA and Jaish al-Fatah, an alliance of terrorist factions actively supported by Saudi Arabia and Turkey, they told news agencies. 
A senior militant said it was going to be ""a big battle"" with all the groups there participating. 
The attack appeared to have been mostly launched by militants from outside the city against government forces that hold its western districts, Reuters news agency reported. 
The so-called Syrian Observatory for Human Right said militants had set off several car bombs on the western edge of Aleppo after launching grad rockets at the city's Nairab airbase. 
Heavy militant bombardment, with more than 150 rockets and shells, struck districts on the southwest of the city, it said. 
The Syrian military said a militant attack in that area had been thwarted and the army had destroyed four car bombs. 
The massive assault by foreign-backed militants comes in the wake of a unilateral ""humanitarian pause"" declared by Syria and Russia in the city. 
On Thursday, the Russian Defense Ministry said aircraft had not carried out any sorties over Aleppo for the past nine days. There were no immediate indication on Friday whether the airstrikes had resumed. 
Militants used a US-Russian ceasefire to break the siege in early August, opening up a new route into the city from the south, but government forces quickly closed it.

Pakistan has declared an Indian diplomat persona non grata and given him 48 hours to leave the country, in a tit-for-tat move that comes a day after India said it would deport a Pakistani official. 
Pakistan's Foreign Ministry said it had declared Indian diplomat Surjeet Singh persona non grata and that it had informed India’s diplomatic mission in Islamabad of the decision. 
The statement said Singh was accused of activities “that were in violation of the Vienna Convention and the established diplomatic norms.” 
An aide to India’s prime minister in New Delhi said the Indian government was looking into the matter. 
The decision came after India said on Thursday it had declared a Pakistani consular official persona non grata for “espionage activities” against New Delhi. 
Mehmood Akhtar, the visa official at the Pakistani mission, had been briefly detained by Indian police on Wednesday outside the gates to the Delhi Zoo where he met two Indian associates. 
Indian police said the Pakistani diplomat and his alleged accomplices were found in possession of forged documents, defense-related maps, deployment charts and lists of officers working along India’s border with Pakistan.

Pakistan’s High Commission in New Delhi dismissed the allegation, saying it “never engages in any activity that is incompatible with its diplomatic status.” 
Relations between India and Pakistan have been strained in recent months, with New Delhi blaming Islamabad for a raid on an army base in Indian-controlled Kashmir in September that killed 19 soldiers. 
Kashmir has been divided between India and Pakistan but claimed in full by both since the two countries gained independence from Britain in 1947. They have fought four wars with each other, three of which have been over Kashmir. 
'Indian soldier, civilian killed in Kashmir' 
An Indian paramilitary officer claimed that Pakistani troops had opened fire along the volatile frontier in Indian-controlled Kashmir, killing a civilian and a soldier. Pakistan's army denied the claim. 
The Indian officer, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said the Pakistani soldiers fired mortars and automatic gunfire at several border posts in Jammu region on Friday in an ""unprovoked"" violation of a ceasefire accord between India and Pakistan in the disputed region. 
Troops from the two countries regularly trade fire, causing casualties. 
On Thursday, protesters in Kashmir and Pakistan observed the Black Day, demonstrating against what they called Indian occupation. Loading ...",1
"FMs of Iran, Syria, Russia meet in Moscow","FMs of Iran, Syria, Russia meet in Moscow Fri Oct 28, 2016 9:48AM Politics Foreign Ministers from Iran, Russia, and Syria, from left, Mohammad Javad Zarif, Sergey Lavrov, and Walid al-Moallem attend their meeting in Moscow, Russia, on October 28, 2016. (Photo by AP) 
Foreign ministers of Iran, Russia and Syria have started trilateral talks on a political solution to the Syria crisis besides a serious fight against the Takfiri terror groups operating in the Arab country. 
On Friday, Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif and his Russian and Syrian counterparts, Sergei Lavrov and Walid Muallem, gathered in Moscow for a three-way meeting. 
Ahead of the meeting, Lavrov said the three nations are acting as a united front against terrorism, saying their talks are mainly focused on ways of seriously tackling terrorism, particularly in Syria. 
The three sides, Lavrov added, will exchange views on humanitarian operations as well as efforts to stop the flow of weapons and military equipment to the foreign-backed militants operating against the Damascus government. 
Prior to the three-way discussions, Zarif held a bilateral meeting with Lavrov to discuss regional issues and the further enhancement of bilateral Tehran-Moscow ties.

Upon his arrival at Vnukovo International Airport in Moscow on Friday morning, Zarif said a political solution besides a serious fight against terrorism is the only way out of the crisis gripping Syria. 
“Unfortunately, some countries have always pursued war and a military solution in Syria. This is while the solution to this crisis is of a political nature and also [entails] battles against Takfiri groups,” said Zarif. 
He added, “We have always emphasized the need for the establishment of an all-out ceasefire, humanitarian operations and efforts to find a political solution to the Syrian issue.” 
Following the trilateral talks, the three ministers attended a joint press conference. 
During the presser, Muallem slammed the US-led coalition purportedly fighting Daesh, saying the alliance has never been fighting terrorism despite its claims. 
He said the Washington-led campaign was in fact encouraging Daesh terrorists to move from Iraq’s Mosul to Syria’s Raqqah. 
Mosul and Raqqah have served as the main Daesh bases in the Middle East over the past years. Iraqi and Syrian armed forces are engaged in large-scale military offensive to drive the terror group from the two cities. 
The Syrian foreign minister further said his country would continue cooperation with Iran and Russia in efforts to eradicate terrorism. 
Muallem described the atmosphere of the talks in Russia as “positive” and “very comfortable.” 
“We in Syria have become convinced of the sincerity of the Russian and Iranian efforts in helping us rout terrorism,” he added.

(Photo by Reuters) 
Zarif, in turn, described the talks in Moscow as “very productive,” saying Iran and Russia have developed “very close” relations in different areas. 
Commenting on the situation in Syria, the top Iranian diplomat said Syria’s sovereignty and territorial integrity must be protected, adding that it is up to the Syrian nation to determine its own destiny and that the voice of the Syrians must be recognized. 
He further highlighted the need for a political settlement of the crisis, adding that Tehran backs the resumption of peace talks between the Syrian government and opposition. 
The Iranian minister called for a ceasefire in Syria, joint battles against terror groups as well as efforts to facilitate aid delivery to Syrian civilians in besieged areas. 
He said the global community must unite in the battle against terrorism, which poses a threat not only to Syria, but the entire world. 
Zarif added that supporting terrorism would serve the interest of no one, warning that the terror groups would eventually “bite the hands that feed them.” 
For his part, the Russian foreign minister also touched on the Mosul battle in Iraq, saying that Iraqi city’s liberation from Daesh would have a significant impact on the balance of power in neighboring Syria. 
Lavrov said the political settlement in Syria should be achieved through dialogue according to the Security Council resolutions, welcoming Syria’s readiness to resume the stalled talks with the opposition. 
Referring to the situation in Aleppo, Lavrov said terrorists blocked the exit routes opened as part of a Syrian humanitarian pause and prevented the civilians from leaving the eastern neighborhoods of Aleppo City. 
The senior Russian official also criticized the international organizations for failing to fulfill their duties towards the locals of eastern Aleppo. 
Lavrov emphasized that the fight against terrorism in Syria will continue, adding that “future common steps” in this regard during the Moscow talks. Loading ...",1

Re: Vladimir Putin,"« Reply #328 on: August 24, 2015, 07:35:18 PM » Didn't really think Putin was falsely fagging.. Oh well. The Assassination of Russia - FSB false flag bombings of 1999 https://youtu.be/y9cRoXgawVA In the fall of 1999, a wave of bloody apartment bombings swept through Russian cities, killing 293 people and causing widespread panic. Although blamed on the Chechen terrorists that the Russians were fighting in the Second Chechen War, FSB agents were caught planting the exact same type of bombs as in the other blasts later that month. The government claimed that the bomb was part of a security exercise and Vladimir Putin came to power as the next Russian President on the back of the terror wave later that year. http://www.historycommons.org/context.jsp?item=a092299ryazanbomb#a092299ryazanbomb On the evening of September 22, 1999, several residents of an apartment block in Ryazan, a city about a hundred miles south of Moscow, observe three strangers at the entrance of their building. The two young men and a woman are carrying large sacks into the basement. The residents notice that the cars plate has been partially covered with paper, although they can still see a Moscow license plate number underneath. They decide to call the local police. After several bombings of apartment buildings in Moscow earlier in the month (see September 9, 1999 and September 13, 1999), their vigilance is understandable. When the police arrive, around 9:00 p.m., they uncover what appears to be huge bomb: three sacks of sugar filled with a granular powder, connected to a detonator and a timing device set for 5:30 a.m. The bomb squad uses a gas testing device to confirm that it is explosive material: it appears to be hexagen, the military explosive that is believed to have been used to blow up two Moscow blocks. The residents are evacuated. Then the bomb carted away and turned over to the FSB. (In an apparent oversight, the FSB fails to collect the detonator, which is photographed by the local police.) The following morning, September 23, the government announces that a terrorist attack has been averted. They praise the vigilance of the local people and the Ryazan police. Police comb the city and find the suspects car. A telephone operator for long-distance calls reports that she overheard a suspicious conversation: the caller said there were too many police to leave town undetected and was told, Split up and each of you make your own way out. To the polices astonishment, the number called belongs to the FSB. Later this day, the massive manhunt succeeds: the suspects are arrested. But the police are again stunned when the suspects present FSB credentials. On Moscows orders, they are quietly released. On September 24, the government reverses itself and now says the bomb was a dummy and the whole operation an exercise to test local vigilance. The official announcement is met with disbelief and anger. Ryazan residents, thousands of whom have had to spend the previous night outdoors, are outraged; local authorities protest that they were not informed. However, the suspicion of a government provocation is not widely expressed and press coverage fades after a few days. It is only several months later that an investigation by the independent weekly Novaya Gazeta re-ignites the controversy (see February 20, 2000 and Fall 1999). The governments explanations will fail to convince skeptics (see March 23, 2000). The Ryazan incident later becomes the main reason for suspecting the government of having orchestrated previous bombings. The controversy is then widely reported in the international press.

On September 22, 1999, a bomb was discovered in the city of Ryazan, about 100 miles south of Moscow. After the chief bomb suspects were discovered to be FSB agents, the government claimed the bomb was a dummy and the incident was a training exercise (see September 22-24, 1999). But the bomb-squad officer, Yuri Tkachenko, is adamant that it was a professionally-prepared, military-style bomb. He defends the accuracy of his sophisticated gas-testing device which identified the explosives as hexogen. The article provokes much comment in Russia but is ignored by the government.

[Source: Terror99.ru]A team of FSB officials, led by Alexander Zdanovich, agrees to a televised meeting with angry and suspicious residents of Ryazan, hoping to put down rumors of a government provocation and shore up the credibility of the official account. In September 1999 a bomb was found in the basement of a building in Ryazan and the people arrested for planting the bomb were discovered to be FSB agents. The government then claimed the incident was merely a training exercise, but residents suspect the FSB wanted to bomb the building to create a fake terrorist incident (see September 22-24, 1999). Zdavonich apologizes for the inconvenience suffered by Ryazan inhabitants but then suggests the renewed interest in the event is a campaign ploy: For months, there was no interest and there were no publications. The theme was activated on the eve of the presidential election with the most fantastic details in order to accuse the FSB of planning a real explosion with the death of people. This is actively used in the political struggle. (The presidential election is only one week away.) A soldier named Alexei Pinyaev has claimed that he worked at a nearby base where hexogen was reportedly kept in sacks marked sugar (see Fall 1999). The commander of the base denies that there was any soldier named Pinyaev, but the Novaya Gazeta reporter who had found Pinyaev then shows pictures of him and plays a recording of his interview. The FSB will not let its three agents appear in public or allow journalists to interview them. The broadcast does not allow any discussion of a possible connection between the Ryazan incident and the apartment bombings in Moscow earlier that month (see September 9, 1999 and September 13, 1999). The FSB officials did not have good explanations for the fact that local authorities, including its own FSB office in Ryazan, were not informed of the supposed exercise, or for the lack of medical resources for the thousands of people forced to spend the night outdoors. According to David Satter, a long-time correspondent in Moscow for the Wall Street Journal and the New York Times who believes the Ryazan incident was a failed provocation, the broadcast only serves to increase the publics misgivings.

Clinton Campaign Chair Had Dinner With Top DOJ Official One Day After Hillary’s Benghazi Hearing,"Zero Hedge October 26, 2016 
In the latest revelation sure to reignite accusations of collusion between the Clinton campaign and the DOJ, among the recent batch of hacked emails released by Wikileaks, we learn that the day after Hillary Clinton testified in front of the House Select Committee on Benghazi last October, John Podesta, Hillary’s campaign chairman met for dinner with a small group of well-connected friends, including Peter Kadzik , who is currently a top official at the US Justice Department serving as Assistant Attorney General for Legislative Affairs. 
Peter Kadzik, with lobbyist Tony Podesta, brother of John Podesta . 
The post-Benghazi dinner was attended by Podesta, Kadzik, superlobbyist Vincent Roberti and other well-placed Beltway fixtures. The first mention of personal contact between Podesta and Kadzik in the Wikileaks dump is in an Oct. 23, 2015 email sent out by Vincent Roberti, a lobbyist who is close to Podesta and his superlobbyist brother, Tony Podesta. In it, Roberti refers to a dinner reservation at Posto, a Washington D.C. restaurant. The dinner was set for 7:30 that evening, just one day after Clinton gave 11 hours of testimony to the Benghazi Committee . 
Podesta and Kadzik met several months later for dinner at Podesta’s home, another email shows . Another email sent on May 5, 2015 , Kadzik’s son asked Podesta for a job on the Clinton campaign. 
As the Daily Caller notes , the dinner arrangement “is just the latest example of an apparent conflict of interest between the Clinton campaign and the federal agency charged with investigating the former secretary of state’s email practices.” As one former U.S. Attorney tells told the DC, the exchanges are another example of the Clinton campaign’s “cozy relationship” with the Obama Justice Department. 
The hacked emails confirm that Podesta and Kadzik were in frequent contact. In one email from January, Kadzik and Podesta, who were classmates at Georgetown Law School in the 1970s, discussed plans to celebrate Podesta’s birthday. And in another sent last May, Kadzik’s son emailed Podesta asking for a job on the Clinton campaign. A d v e r t i s e m e n t 
“The political appointees in the Obama administration, especially in the Department of Justice, appear to be very partisan in nature and I don’t think had clean hands when it comes to the investigation of the private email server,” says Matthew Whitaker, the executive director of the Foundation for Accountability and Civic Trust, a government watchdog group. 
“ It’s the kind of thing the American people are frustrated about is that the politically powerful have insider access and have these kind of relationships that ultimately appear to always break to the benefit of Hillary Clinton ,” he added, comparing the Podesta-Kadzik meetings to the revelation that Attorney General Loretta Lynch met in private with Bill Clinton at the airport in Phoenix days before the FBI and DOJ investigating Hillary Clinton. 
Kadzik’s role at the DOJ, where he started in 2013, is particularly notable Kadzik, as helped spearhead the effort to nominate Lynch, who was heavily criticized for her secret meeting with the former president. 
A Long, Friendly History 
Podesta and Kadzik have a long history, one which has surprisingly gone mostly unnoticed during the ongoing Clinton email scandal. As DC helps summarize, Kadzik represented Podesta during the Monica Lewinsky investigation. And in the waning days of the Bill Clinton administration, Kadzik lobbied Podesta on behalf of Marc Rich, the fugitive who Bill Clinton controversially pardoned on his last day in office. 
That history is cited by Podesta in another email hacked from his Gmail account. In a Sept. 2008 email , which the Washington Free Beacon flagged last week, Podesta emailed an Obama campaign official to recommend Kadzik for a supportive role in the campaign. Podesta, who would later head up the Obama White House transition effort, wrote that Kadzik was a “fantastic lawyer” who “ kept me out of jail.” 
As the DC Chuck Ross notes, it is unclear to which case Podesta was referring and whether he was joking about prison. But Podesta was caught in a sticky situation in both the Lewinsky affair and the Rich pardon scandal. As deputy chief of staff to Clinton in 1996, Podesta asked then-United Nations ambassador Bill Richardson to hire the 23-year-old Lewinsky . In April 1996, the White House transferred Lewinsky from her job as a White House intern to the Pentagon in order to keep her and Bill Clinton separate. But the Clinton team also wanted to keep Lewinsky happy so that she would not spill the beans about her sexual relationship with Clinton. 
Richardson later recounted in his autobiography that he offered Lewinsky the position but that she declined it. 
Podesta made false statements to a grand jury impaneled by Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr for the investigation. But he defended the falsehoods, saying later that he was merely relaying false information from Clinton that he did not know was inaccurate at the time. “He did lie to me,” Podesta said about Clinton in a National Public Radio interview in 1998. Clinton was acquitted by the Senate in Feb. 1999 of perjury and obstruction of justice charges related to the Lewinsky probe. Kadzik, then a lawyer with the firm Dickstein Shapiro Morin & Oshinsky, represented Podesta through the fiasco. 
Podesta had been promoted to Clinton’s chief of staff when he and Kadzik became embroiled in another scandal. 
Kadzik was then representing Marc Rich, a billionaire financier who was wanted by the U.S. government for evading a $48 million tax bill. The fugitive, who was also implicated in illegal trading activity with nations that sponsored terrorism, had been living in Switzerland for 17 years when he sought the pardon. To help Rich, Kadzik lobbied Podesta heavily in the weeks before Clinton left office on Jan. 20, 2001. A House Oversight Committee report released in May 2002 stated that “Kadzik was recruited into Marc Rich’s lobbying campaign because he was a long-time friend of White House Chief of Staff John Podesta.” 
The report noted that Kadzik contacted Podesta at least seven times regarding Rich’s pardon. 
On top of the all-hands-on-deck lobbying effort, Rich’s ex-wife, Denise Rich, had doled out more than $1 million to the Clintons and other Democrats prior to the pardon. She gave $100,000 to Hillary Clinton’s New York Senate campaign and another $450,000 to the Clinton presidential library. 
Kadzik’s current role 
In his current role as head of the Office of Legislative Affairs, Kadzik handles inquiries from Congress on a variety of issues. In that role he was not in the direct chain of command on the Clinton investigation. The Justice Department and FBI have insisted that career investigators oversaw the investigation, which concluded in July with no charges filed against Clinton. 
But Kadzik worked on other Clinton email issues in his dealings with Congress. Last November, he denied a request from Republican lawmakers to appoint a special counsel to lead the investigation . 
In a Feb. 1, 2016 letter in response to Kadzik, Florida Rep. Ron DeSantis noted that Kadzik had explained “that special counsel may be appointed at the discretion of the Attorney General when an investigation or prosecution by the Department of Justice would create a potential conflict of interest.” 
DeSantis, a Republican, suggested that Lynch’s appointment by Bill Clinton in 1999 as U.S. Attorney in New York may be considered a conflict of interest. He also asserted that Obama’s political appointees — a list which includes Kadzik — “are being asked to impartially execute their respective duties as Department of Justice officials that may involve an investigation into the activities of the forerunner for the Democratic nomination for President of the United States. ” 
It is unknown if Kadzik responded to DeSantis’ questions. 
Kadzik’s first involvement in the Clinton email brouhaha came in a Sept. 24, 2015 response letter to Senate Judiciary Committee chairman Chuck Grassley in which he declined to confirm or deny whether the DOJ was investigating Clinton. Last month, Politico reported that Kadzik angered Republican lawmakers when, in a classified briefing, he declined to say whether Clinton aides who received DOJ immunity were required to cooperate with congressional probes. 
Kadzik also testified at a House Oversight Committee hearing last month on the issue of classifications and redactions in the FBI’s files of the Clinton email investigation. This article was posted: Wednesday, October 26, 2016 at 9:52 am Share this article",1

"Strange messages coming from the stars are ‘probably’ from aliens, scientists say","October 26, 2016 
Scientists have heard hugely unusual messages from deep in space that they think are coming from aliens. 
A new analysis of strange modulations in a tiny set of stars appears to indicate that it could be coming from extraterrestrial intelligence that is looking to alert us to their existence. 
The new study reports the finding of specific modulations in just 234 out of the 2.5 million stars that have been observed during a survey of the sky. The work found that a tiny fraction of them seemed to be behaving strangely. 
And there appears to be no obvious explanation for what is going on, leaving the scientists behind the paper to conclude that the messages are coming from aliens. This article was posted: Wednesday, October 26, 2016 at 9:30 am Share this article",1

Defense Board: White House Blocked Navy From S. China Sea Warship Passages,"Washington Free Beacon October 26, 2016 
Senior White House officials blocked the Navy from conducting needed freedom of navigation operations in the South China Sea amid growing concerns that China is militarizing newly reclaimed islands, according to the Pentagon’s Defense Policy Board. 
A working paper produced in September 2015 by John Hamre, the policy board chairman, called for an immediate resumption of Navy warship passages to prevent China from taking over the strategic Southeast Asian waterway. 
The internal document was disclosed Monday by WikiLeaks as part of its latest batch of hacked emails from the account of John Podesta, campaign chairman for Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton. The Obama administration has accused “Russia’s senior-most officials” of hacking and leaking the emails posted to WikiLeaks and other sites in order to influence the 2016 election. 
The document was labeled “Chairman’s Working Notes of the Defense Policy Board – Chinese Island-Building in the South China Sea.” It was sent to Jake Sullivan, the Clinton campaign’s senior policy adviser, by Stuart Eizenstat, a Defense Policy Board member who was advising the campaign on internal Pentagon deliberations.

"Syrian Mother: Islamic State Baked Christians, ‘Kneaded’ Children in Bakery Machines","Breitbart October 26, 2016 
A Syrian Christian mother shared her story of escaping the Islamic State terrorist group in a suburb of Damascus while losing her son, George, after he refused to identify himself to the terrorists by a Muslim name. 
The woman, Alice Assaf, said that she had heard that her son, who was beaten and shot to death, was spared a much worse fate: being baked in the ovens of the local bakery or “kneaded” to death in the bakery’s industrial-sized mixer. 
Assaf told her story to Roads of Success , a human rights NGO with a focus on the rights of women and Christians in the Middle East. The group has provided testimony of the plight of Christians and Yazidis persecuted by the Islamic State to the House Foreign Relations Committee and regularly publishes video interviews with ISIS attack survivors. 
The Christian Post picked up the story and video interview, in which Assaf narrates the final days of her 18-year-old’s life. This article was posted: Wednesday, October 26, 2016 at 6:30 am Share this article",1
"Anger in NATO, EU as Syria-bound Russian carrier group mulls stopover at Spanish port","RT October 26, 2016 
Top NATO & EU officials expressed anger at Spain’s permit reportedly issued to a Russian aircraft carrier group to take on fuel and supplies at Ceuta, a city with unclear political status. Spain says Russia’s warships have been mooring there “for years.” 
A barrage of harsh statements followed when Spanish media reported that Russia’s naval battle group led by aircraft carrier Admiral Kuznetsov would make a stopover at the autonomous port of Ceuta after passing the Straits of Gibraltar on Wednesday. 
Battle Stations! Putin’s fearsome fleet locked, loaded & ready for war with Britain… or not 
Russian ships would moor in Ceuta to take on fuel and supplies under a permit issued by Spain’s Foreign Ministry, Spanish newspaper ABC reported on Tuesday, also citing Defense Minister Pedro Morenes, who said that “there was a prior authorization for this particular case.” 
Guy Verhofstadt, former Belgian prime minister and currently EU envoy for Brexit talks with the UK, expressed his outrage, calling Spain’s decision “the harassment of EU and NATO forces.” 
In a Facebook post, he said that NATO member Spain “provides assistance to a fleet which has one purpose,” adding that “only last week this Spanish Government signed up to a statement from the European Council accusing Russia of war crimes against civilians in Aleppo.” 
Later in the day, NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg made it clear that the bloc wants Madrid to rethink the stopover permit. A d v e r t i s e m e n t 
“We are concerned and I have expressed that very clearly about potential use of this battle group to increase Russia’s ability and to be a platform for airstrikes against Syria,” he said. 
“This is something I have conveyed very clearly before and I repeat those concerns today and I believe that all NATO allies are aware that this battle group can be used to conduct airstrikes against Aleppo and Syria.” 
He then downplayed the rhetoric, noting that “it’s for each nation to decide whether these ships can get supplies and be fuelled in different harbors along the route towards the eastern Mediterranean.” 
Late Tuesday night, the Spanish Foreign Ministry said it was “reviewing” the decision. “The latest stopover requests are being reviewed at the moment based on the information we are receiving from our allies and from Russian authorities,” the ministry said in a statement, quoted by Reuters. 
Earlier in the day, however, the ministry told RIA Novosti that Madrid allows Russian ships to dock in Spanish ports as “routine navigation” which effectively lies outside EU sanctions imposed on Moscow. 
In the meantime, a spokesman for the Foreign Ministry told the Telegraph the requests from the Russian Navy “are considered on case-by-case basis,” stressing that “Russian navy vessels have been making calls in Spanish ports for years.” 
Ceuta, an autonomous Spanish enclave on the tip of Africa’s northern coast, lies along the Straits of Gibraltar and borders Morocco, which also claims the territory as its own. 
Although Ceuta is part of the EU, its status within NATO is still unresolved. Since 2011, Spain has rankled the bloc by allowing 57 Russian warships to refuel at the enclave. 
The mission of the Admiral Kuznetsov carrier group has already triggered a media frenzy across Europe, with British, Norwegian, and Dutch navies sending frigates and surveillance vessels to shadow the Russian warships as they round European shores through international waters. 
Once they reach Syrian shores, the ships will provide backup for Russia’s naval standing group already deployed to the area, according to the Russian Defense Ministry. This article was posted: Wednesday, October 26, 2016 at 6:21 am Share this article",1
US-led coalition killed 300 Syrian civilians in 11 probed strikes – Amnesty,"RT October 26, 2016 
Around 300 civilians were killed in eleven airstrikes conducted by the US-led coalition in Syria, which Amnesty International investigated for its latest report. Amnesty says the US must come clean about the civilian toll of its fight against Islamic State. 
Amnesty suspects that US Central Command (CENTCOM), which directs coalition airstrikes in Syria, “may have… carried out unlawful attacks” in Syria, failing to take necessary measures to prevent civilian killings. 
“We fear the US-led coalition is significantly underestimating the harm caused to civilians in its operations in Syria,” said Lynn Maalouf, Deputy Director for Research at Amnesty International’s Beirut regional office. 
“It’s high time the US authorities came clean about the full extent of the civilian damage caused by coalition attacks in Syria. Independent and impartial investigations must be carried out into any potential violations of international humanitarian law and the findings should be made public.” 
Amnesty investigated evidence, including eyewitness accounts, reports by human rights organizations and the media, photographs and video footage as well as satellite imagery, related to 11 suspected coalition attacks in Syria. The group estimates that the attacks have claimed as many as 300 civilian lives. So far none of these deaths has been acknowledged by CENTCOM. 
The report published on Wednesday added that the total civilian death toll from coalition action “could be as high as 600 or more than 1,000” since the operation against Islamic State (IS, formerly ISIS, ISIL) started in Syria in 2014. 
One of the strikes investigated by Amnesty took place in the early hours of December 7, 2015. The attacks hit two houses in the village of Ayn al-Khan, near al-Hawl in al-Hasakah governorate in northern Syria, killing 40 civilians, including 19 children, and injuring at least 30 others, the report said. A d v e r t i s e m e n t 
According to an eyewitness account, an initial night strike was followed by a second attack from a helicopter gunship, which hit first responders trying to dig out survivors. 
“At this point I had a two-month-old baby boy in my arms whom I had rescued. The hit caused me to fall and drop him… I fell into the hole made by the air strike. That was what saved me… My mother, aunt, wife and children – a daughter who was four years old and a son who was two and a half were all killed. The woman and her son who I’d rescued were killed. Everyone but me was killed,” the survivor said. 
The strike is believed to have targeted IS fighters. But local Kurdish militia reportedly warned the coalition that there were civilians in the area. 
Amnesty said CENTCOM’s failure to acknowledge civilian deaths in Syria, as well as the poor record of investigating such incidents in Afghanistan and Iraq, poses grave concerns over the toll which the civilian population of Mosul, Iraq is likely to face from the ongoing operation to take the city from IS. The US-led coalition is providing air support for the offensive. 
“Given the likely increase in air strikes by the US-led Coalition as part of the Iraqi offensive to recapture Mosul, it is even more pressing that CENTCOM be fully transparent about the impact of their military actions on civilians. And it is crucial that they adhere scrupulously to international humanitarian law, including by taking all feasible precautions to spare civilians and to minimize harm to civilian homes and infrastructure,” said Maalouf. 
A similar operation to capture Manbij, Syria, which is far smaller than Mosul, killed more than 200 civilians, Amnesty estimated. 
Last week, Amnesty International blasted Russia for civilian deaths in Aleppo. The Syrian city is divided between government forces and various armed groups, including the Al-Qaeda offshoot Al-Nusra Front. Russia says that the militants use civilians as human shields and would not allow them to leave the city, derailing several attempts by Russia to open humanitarian corridors out of the city.

Hollande set to lose French presidency after complaining ‘there are too many immigrants’,"UK Express October 26, 2016 
The European leader’s controversial statements reportedly included Hollande saying the justice system was “full of cowards”, that there were “too many immigrants” and that there was a “problem” with Islam. 
Mr Hollande also spoke harshly about senior politicians in the book, which was released just as he intended to make public his desire to run for the presidency again in 2017. 
He blamed US President Barack Obama for creating ISIS saying: “I don’t know what would have happened if we had carried out strikes. What I can say is that we did not carry out strikes, and there’s Daesh.” 
Now party members are giving up on the leader following the hapless blunder. 
The party are scrambling to pick up the pieces, looking to Prime Minister Manuel Valls – who is disliked in the party – and Segolene Royal – the environment minister and an ex partner of Mr Hollande who is equally unsuccessful in electoral races.

On 25 October 2015, Christoph Biro wrote of the masses of migrants who were travelling through the Styrian countryside and remarked on the assaults and property damage committed by migrants, reports Kurier . 
Calling the majority of the migrants “testosterone-driven Syrians”, Mr. Biro recounted the multiple reports of migrants carrying out, in his words, “extremely aggressive sexual assaults”.

Samantha Bee Says “Partial Birth Abortion is Not a Thing.” WRONG.,"Louder With Crowder October 26, 2016 
Samantha Bee is proof positive that being funny, clever, or photogenic are no longer requirements in leftist media. I guess we can call that progress. Problem is, whatever the size of Bee’s audience, there is still an audience. Which she lied to. Par for the course in leftist circles, but this one needs a rebuttal. Samantha Bee said “Partial birth abortion” is not a thing, while she ranted and raved at Donald Trump for his comments in the final debate . Sorry, Sammy. Partial birth abortion is sadly a thing… 
Here’s what I find interesting: Bee’s need to explain away partial birth abortion shows just how unpopular the procedure is. She’s trying to get rid of it. Not unlike a woman hoping to chop shop her unborn baby . Of course she stops short of saying “it’s a heinous, evil thing for people to do to their own children,” by excusing the sick, evil, twisted women (and the “doctors” who perform the butchery) who make it happen. Sorry, there is no reason to suck the brains out of a partially born baby for the “health of the mother,” or “if the baby has a terminal disease.” 
Abortion is always wrong. Like, always. 
Because chopping up a baby while it’s partially hanging out of the mother, its head still in the birth canal, because it’s “going to die anyway” makes sense. If you agree with killing a baby like this, for any reason, you’re sick. Probably a little bit evil. Read Dear Evil Women Who Abort their Babies… Yep, that was written for you abortion supporters. Not sorry. You might also like Dear Liberal Women: No, Getting an Abortion is Not “Brave”… This article was posted: Wednesday, October 26, 2016 at 6:07 am Share this article",1
Leaked Emails Reveal Hillary Can’t Speak for Very Long Without a Podium… So Were the Debates Rigged?,"The Daily Sheeple October 26, 2016 
Wikileaks continues to be a treasure trove of info about the behind-the-scenes rigging of what is turning out to be the most infamous presidential election in American history. 
Remember the first debate between Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump and the conspiracy surrounding “podiumgate” ? 
Hillary required a specially built podium under the pretext that she didn’t want to appear shorter than Trump. 
After the debate was over, however, a sneaky “cleaner man” was caught on tape approaching Hillary’s podium multiple times, removing various items and looking as shady as possible while doing it. What could also clearly be seen was what appeared to be a lit screen dimming specifically in her podium and not in Trump’s just after the debate officially ended. 
This led to lots of speculation on whether or not Hillary cheated during the first debate against Trump and other debates as well, having her comments fed to her. 
Well, if the Wikileaks Podesta emails are any indication, it’s very possible. Why? A d v e r t i s e m e n t 
Because apparently Hillary can’t give long speeches without a podium. 
In fact, these emails (and this isn’t even all of them, but enough for you to get the picture) prove her team is well aware of the fact that everything has to be kept “short and sweet” unless Hillary has a podium. 
So how are we supposed to believe she was able to speak at the 90-minutes debates without prepared notes being fed to her somehow? 
Especially that final debate where she appeared to be reading more than writing, looking down all the time at some sort of lit screen embedded in the podium as pointed out in other debates, as shown in the video above.

Obamacare Architect Gruber Demands “Larger Mandate Penalty”,"Bureaucrat who said “stupidity” of Americans helped get law passed doubles down 
Paul Joseph Watson Prison Planet.com October 26, 2016 
Obamacare architect Jonathan Gruber – the bureaucrat who once bragged that the “stupidity” of the American people was crucial for passing the health care law in the first place – told CNN that the “fix” for Obamacare was to impose a “larger mandate penalty”. CNN’s CAROL COSTELLO: “So let’s talk about how exactly you can fix Obamacare. I just need you to be specific because I think people really want answers. So Hillary Clinton says she can fix Obamacare. So what would one fix that would drive premiums down?” JONATHAN GRUBER: “Look, once again, there’s no sense it has to be fixed. The law is working as designed. However, it could work better. And I think, probably the most important things experts would agree on is we need a larger mandate penalty“… Gruber’s arrogance is incredible. Even after the Obama administration acknowledged that premiums are set to skyrocket next year, Gruber thinks that the answer is to financially punish Americans to an even greater degree. Gruber is essentially admitting that Obamacare is designed to make Americans destitute. “ObamaCare was never designed *not* to overwhelm you with the shifting of massive costs. ObamaCare was designed to crush you in costs,” points out the Conservative Treehouse blog . His comments shouldn’t come as much of a surprise given what Gruber thinks of the American people. A series of videos that emerged in 2014 featured Gruber admitting that Obamacare was deceptively crafted in order to fool “stupid” Americans into not realizing that it would mean massive price hikes and that the law’s “lack of transparency (was) a huge political advantage” in selling it.

Nuclear Reactor in Norway Leaks Radioactive Iodine,"Prison Planet.com October 26, 2016 
One of Norway’s nuclear reactors was discovered to be leaking radioactive iodine Monday morning, according to the Norwegian Radiation Protection Authority (NRPA). [1] 
In a statement released today, the NRPA said: 
“The radioactive leak was due to a technical failure during treatment of the fuel in the reactor hall. Emissions are low.” 
Experts say contamination levels around the Institute for Energy Technology, in the southern town of Halden, were well within legal limits and posed no risk to the public. 
Said Per Strand, deputy director-general at the NRPA, a government regulator: 
“Of course it’s an unfortunate situation but there is a low environmental risk. This is not the sort of leak we want.” [2] 
The radioactive iodine was a byproduct of the uranium which powers the facility. 
Staff were evacuated from the institute, but later returned, donning protective gear, to assess the cause and extent of the leak, and halt it. 
A senior NRPA official said the incident would “maybe” be rated a 1 on the International Nuclear Event Scale, which rates nuclear incidents from 1 to 7. By comparison, the incidents at Fukishima and Chernobyl were ranked 7. [3] Source: The Government of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region 
Regulatory officials were frustrated that they were not notified about the leak until today . Atle Valseth, a research director at the Institute for Energy Technology, agreed. He said: 
“I don’t sit so close to those decisions but I think we should have informed the authority yesterday. We will have to go through why it wasn’t reported — it wasn’t good enough that we didn’t report it yesterday.” [2] 
Strand, the head of safety, preparedness and environment at the NRPA, expressed the regulator’s frustration. 
“We need to gather more information … But we are not happy with the situation, that we were not warned immediately. We will investigate further.” [3] 
The Swiss Radiation Safety Authority (SRSA) said i t has not detected any radiation emanating from the facility, which sits close to the Swiss border. 
Mark Foreman, a nuclear expert at the Chalmers University of Technology in Sweden, stressed that the vast majority of the radioactive iodine is trapped inside the fuel, which is contained within a ceramic material. The ceramic-wrapped material is stored inside a metal tube that is welded shut. The tube is inside the reactor. 
The iodine would have to leak out of the reactor to enter the reactor hall.

Are Tensions With Russia Even Real?,"10-26-16 In September 2015, at the behest of its legitimate government, Russia began aerial operations to combat ISIS and al-Nusra terrorists in Syria. Numerous other likeminded groups are involved, just as cutthroat, just as ruthless, just as extremist, masquerading as moderate rebels when none exist - supported by Washington, NATO, Saudi Arabia, Qatar, other Gulf States, Jordan, Israel and Turkey.Theyre massacring civilians, killing government soldiers defending them, using chemical and other banned weapons, committing gruesome atrocities.Why does Russia pretend conflict is civil when Syria was invaded by terrorists, imported from scores of countries, serving as US imperial foot soldiers? Why does it pretend moderate fighters are involved when none exist? Why does it insist on separating nonexistent moderates from terrorist groups its combating when all anti-government forces are the same?Why isnt it targeting all armed groups wanting Assad toppled and Syrian sovereign independence destroyed? Its the only way to free the country from the scourge its facing - supported by Washington and its rogue allies, NATO and regional ones.Why did it halt its aerial operations to liberate eastern Aleppo, declaring a unilateral ceasefire, a so-called humanitarian pause - a major blunder, accomplishing nothing? Ongoing since October 18, its letting US-supported terrorists infesting the city replenish their ranks, regroup and mobilize for heavy attacks, largely harming civilians Moscow says it wants protected.Last Saturday evening, Russia ended its humanitarian pause because US-supported terrorists in eastern Aleppo prevent civilians from leaving, holding thousands hostage as human shields, including the sick and wounded.Yet it ceased aerial attacks, yielding the advantage to dark forces its sworn to eliminate. What kind of strategy gives them the upper hand? It gets worse.On October 26, Russian Defense Ministry spokesman General Igor Konashenkov issued the following statement:The Russian Aerospace Forces and the Syrian Air Force have been sticking to a moratorium on air strikes for the past eight days. They are staying out of a 10-km (six-mile) zone around Aleppo.Six humanitarian corridors, field kitchens and first aid stations are open for civilians leaving eastern Aleppo 24 hours a day.Russia and the Syrian government are ready to resume humanitarian pauses in Aleppo if they receive guarantees from international organizations confirming readiness to evacuate the sick and the wounded as well as civilian population from the rebel-held areas.Fact: Maintaining an airstrike moratorium aids Washington, its rogue allies and terrorists in eastern Aleppo they support.Fact: What good are humanitarian corridors if eastern Aleppo residents are prevented from using them, risking death or serious injury if they try.Fact: International organizations have no control over terrorists in eastern Aleppo - or anywhere else in the country. So what good are their guarantees if made?Fact: As long as Russia continues making the same mistakes repeatedly, the struggle to liberate Syria will likely go on interminably without resolution - a forever war, while countless thousands more civilians will die, be seriously injured and endure hardships people in Western societies cant imagine, victims of US imperial ruthlessness.A handful of eastern Aleppo civilians alone escaped via a humanitarian corridor. According to one now free, their relatives were seized, imprisoned and tortured.The only way to liberate thousands of others is by relentlessly smashing their terrorist captors, eliminating them - not giving them breathing room to mobilize for greater attacks.Washington is delighted with Moscows ceasefire and humanitarian pause, serving US imperial interests, State Department spokesman admiral John Kirby saying:We welcome the stated intention to extend this pause, and we hope that this extension will be more successful than it has been thus far - meaning the longer it continues, the greater the benefit to US-led dark forces, the worse off trapped Syrians in eastern Aleppo will be, the longer the struggle to liberate Syria will go on.Stephen Lendman lives in Chicago.

Nvidia has chosen to remove functionality from a Linux driver to ensure that it isn't more capable than the Windows version. This really doesn't sound like the action of a company that wants to get along well with Linux developers and users. So far, Nvidia hasn't indicated whether this is a temporary situation, or more likely a permanent arrangement.There can be one of two obvious motives for this, which amount to two sides of the same coin. Either Nvidia doesn't want to be seen to show up an embarrassing limitation in Windows or the Windows driver, or the continuing acrimony between the graphics firm and Linux is not over yet.While for most users three monitors are ample, making this a fairly niche problem, it's an example of a company manipulating the marketplace. Of course controlling the flow of progress in order to sell another product is nothing new - video games makers have been doing that since the 1980s.But to control the flow of progress to favour one platform over another is playing ""technology god"" and sets a disturbing precedent.

Last year, the number of deaths increased by 18% over the year before.A March 2011 earthquake and tsunami triggered multiple meltdowns at the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant on Japan's northeast coast, in what has become the worst nuclear disaster in history. A massive radioactive plume was released by the meltdowns, and the crippled plant has continued to leak radiation into the surrounding environment, including into the Pacific Ocean.A total of about 160,000 people were evacuated as a result of the Fukushima disaster. More fatalities on the horizon? According to data collected by the Fukushima Prefecture, 2014 saw 1,232 nuclear-related deaths. The two towns with the greatest number of deaths were both near the Fukushima plant: Namie, with 359 dead; and Tomioka, with 291 dead.The term ""nuclear-related"" means a death that does not result directly from radiation exposure but is caused by a disease later caused by that exposure. Indeed, it is radiation-related diseases -- including cancer, tumors and genetic damage -- that often cause the bulk of health problems and fatalities in cases of radiation exposure.One of the diseases particularly expected to show an uptick after the Fukushima disaster is thyroid cancer, because radioactive iodine from nuclear disasters tends to concentrate in the thyroid gland. An estimated 6,000 children contracted thyroid cancer following the Chernobyl nuclear disaster. It typically takes four to five years for most nuclear-related thyroid cancers to manifest, and as that window approaches many Fukushima parents believe that their children are already showing symptoms. Fukushima officials have tested approximately 300,000 children and have turned up 100 cases of the disease, in contrast to the pre-disaster rate of one or two per million children.One parent concerned about her child's thyroid cancer risk is Megumi Muto. Muto's daughter, Nana, has been diagnosed with lumps in her thyroid gland, and the lumps are growing. Muto is certain that the tumors were caused by Nana's exposure to Fukushima radiation.""I feel angry,"" Muto said. ""I think the authorities hide the real dangers and now many more children are being diagnosed.""The health of both of Muto's children has deteriorated after being exposed to the radioactive fallout, she said.""They had rashes on their bodies then nose bleeds. My son's white cells have decreased and they both have incredible fatigue,"" she said. ""They may not have cancer now but they both have multiple nodules around their thyroids. I'm really worried."" Residents suing government Muto and about 100 other Fukushima residents are currently suing the local and national governments, alleging that the governments failed to protect their children during the nuclear disaster.This sentiment was echoed in a recent report, released by a parliamentary panel, which said that the Fukushima incident was, in part, a ""man-made disaster"" caused by ""government, regulatory authorities and Tokyo Electric Power Company,"" which were all lacking in ""a sense of responsibility to protect people's lives and society.""Because they do not trust the government's number, Muto and her fellow plaintiffs have conducted their own tests of the radiation levels in their neighborhoods. One test, conducted near a school in Fukushima city, registered radiation levels nearly 100 times that found in Tokyo.Those levels are high enough to warrant investigation, said plaintiff Sumio Konno, who has been a nuclear engineer for 29 years.""I have to investigate and inform the public of the facts, that is why I have become one of the plaintiffs of the court cases,"" Konno said. ""They're still not decontaminating areas where children live or near schools, even after four years."" Sources:",1

WATCH: Hillary Aide RUSHES to Her Side to Help Her Climb ONE Step!,"Information Liberation October 27, 2016 
Video out of Florida shows a panicked Clinton aide rush to her side in order to help her climb one step. 
When the aide sees Her Hagliness is going to reach a small riser before him, he’s seen making a mad dash towards her. Hillary then turns, grabs his hand for balance and while clutching him for dear life manages to tackle the one step before her. 
You have to wonder what made him so panicked. Did she collapse once again in secret? This article was posted: Thursday, October 27, 2016 at 5:37 am Share this article",1

Get Ready For Civil Unrest: Survey Finds That Most Americans Are Concerned About Election Violence,"Economic Collapse October 27, 2016 
Could we see violence no matter who wins on November 8th? Let’s hope that it doesn’t happen, but as you will see below, anti-Trump violence is already sweeping the nation. 
If Trump were to actually win the election, that would likely send the radical left into a violent post-election temper tantrum unlike anything that we have ever seen before. Alternatively, there is a tremendous amount of concern on the right that this election could be stolen by Hillary Clinton. And as I showed yesterday, it appears that voting machines in Texas are already switching votes from Donald Trump to Hillary Clinton . If Hillary Clinton wins this election under suspicious circumstances, that also may be enough to set off widespread civil unrest all across the country. 
At this moment there is less than two weeks to go until November 8th, and a brand new survey has found that a majority of Americans are concerned “about the possibility of violence” on election day… 
A 51% majority of likely voters express at least some concern about the possibility of violence on Election Day; one in five are “very concerned.” Three of four say they have confidence that the United States will have the peaceful transfer of power that has marked American democracy for more than 200 years, but just 40% say they are “very confident” about that. 
More than four in 10 of Trump supporters say they won’t recognize the legitimacy of Clinton as president, if she prevails, because they say she wouldn’t have won fair and square. 
But many on the left are not waiting until after the election to commit acts of violence. On Wednesday, Donald Trump’s star on the Walk of Fame was smashed into pieces by a man with a sledgehammer and a pick-ax… 
Donald Trump took a lot of hits today, and not just in the Presidential race. With less than two weeks to go before America decides if the ex- Apprentice host will pull off a surprise victory over Hillary Clinton, Trump’s star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame was destroyed early Wednesday morning by a man dressed as a city construction worker and wielding a sledgehammer and pick-ax in what looks to be a Tinseltown first. 
And there were two other instances earlier this year when Donald Trump’s star was also vandalized. One came in January, and the other happened in June … 
This is of course not the first time the GOP candidate’s star has been attacked or defaced since Trump announced his White House bid in summer 2015. The most extreme measure was a reverse swastika being sprayed on the star at 6801 Hollywood Blvd in late January. In June this summer, a mute sign was painted on Trump’s star in a seemingly protest against the antagonistic language and policies some have accused Trump of promoting and reveling in during the campaign. In both cases, Trump’s star was quickly cleaned and back as new within a day. 
We have seen anti-Trump violence on the east coast as well. Earlier this month, someone decided to firebomb the Republican Party headquarters in Orange County, North Carolina. On the building next to the headquarters, someone spray-painted “Nazi Republicans get out of town or else” along with a swastika. 
There have also been other disturbing incidents of anti-Trump violence all over the nation in recent days. A recent Lifezette article put together quite a long list, and the following is just a short excerpt from that piece… 
On Oct. 15 in Bangor, Maine, vandals spray-painted about 20 parked cars outside a Trump rally. Trump supporter Paul Foster, whose van was hit with white paint, told reporters, “Why can’t they do a peaceful protest instead of painting cars, all of this, to make their statement?” 
Around Oct. 3, a couple of Trump supporters were assaulted in Zeitgeist, a San Francisco bar, after they were allegedly refused service for expressing support for Trump, GotNews reports. “The two Trump supporters were attacked, punched, and chased into the street by ‘some thugs’ that a barmaid called out from the back.” Lilian Kim of ABC 7 Bay Area tweeted a photo of the men, in which one was wearing a Trump T-shirt and the other was wearing a “Blue Lives Matter” shirt. 
On Sept. 28 in El Cajon, California, an angry mob at a Black Lives Matter protest beat 21-year-old Trump supporter Feras Jabro for wearing a “Make America Great Again” baseball cap. The assault was broadcast live using the smartphone app Periscope. 
There is a move to get Trump supporters to wear red on election day, but in many parts of America that might just turn his supporters into easy targets. Let’s certainly hope that we don’t see the kind of violent confrontations at voting locations that many experts are anticipating. 
Of course there are also many on the right that are fighting mad, and a Hillary Clinton victory under suspicious circumstances may be enough to push them over the edge. 
For example, this week former Congressman Joe Walsh said that he is “grabbing my musket” if Donald Trump loses the election… 
Former Rep. Joe Walsh appeared to call for armed revolution Wednesday if Donald Trump is not elected president. 
Walsh, a former tea party congressman from Illinois who is now a conservative talk radio host, tweeted, “On November 8th, I’m voting for Trump. On November 9th, if Trump loses, I’m grabbing my musket. You in?” 
And without a doubt, many ordinary Americans are stocking up on guns and ammunition just in case Hillary Clinton is victorious. The following comes from USA Today … 
“Since the polls are starting to shift quite a bit towards Hillary Clinton, I’ve been buying a lot more ammunition,” says Rick Darling, 69, an engineer from Harrison Township, in Michigan’s Detroit suburbs. In a follow-up phone interview after being surveyed, the Trump supporter said he fears progressives will want to “declare martial law and take our guns away” after the election. 
Today America is more divided than I have ever seen it before, and the mainstream media is constantly fueling the hatred and the anger that various groups feel toward one another. 
Ironically, Donald Trump has been working very hard to bring America together. In fact, he is solidly on track to win a higher percentage of the black vote than any Republican presidential candidate since 1960 . 
If Hillary Clinton and the Democrats win on November 8th, things will not go well for Hillary Clinton’s political enemies. The Clintons used the power of the White House to go after their enemies the first time around, and Hillary is even more angry and more bitter now than she was back then. 
And the radical left is very clear about who their enemies are. This is something that I discussed on national television earlier this month … 
As I write this, it is difficult for me to even imagine how horrible a Hillary Clinton presidency would be. 
But at this point that appears to be the most likely outcome . 
Out of all the candidates that we could have chosen, the American people are about to put the most evil one by far into the White House. 
Perhaps Donald Trump can still pull off a miracle and we can avoid that fate, but time is rapidly slipping away and November 8th will be here before we know it.  50  ",1

Guardian Front Page: “A 16-Year-Old Migrant Cries…”,"October 27, 2016 
Won’t you take pity on this poor, innocent little child? 
This image of a “16-year-old” migrant crying – which is currently plastered on the front page of The Guardian – is nothing short of laughable. 
“A 16-year-old from Ethiopia cries while he awaits registration at a processing centre in the makeshift refugee camp near Calais,” the photo’s caption reads. The image is placed under a headline reading: “Councils resist pressure to take children from Calais.” 

This crying “child” is supposed to make Brits feel guilty and demand their government allow “children” like him into their nation. 
The image is not a fake, nor is it being used satirically. It comes from the Associated Press’ Emilio Morenatti , you can see four pictures of the man for sale on their website . 
The “child migrant” is clearly in his 40’s, yet their editors evidently believe their readers are so incredibly stupid they’ll actually believe they’re looking at a 16-year-old boy. 
A look at Emilio’s twitter shows one person appears to have actually bought the lie: @morenatti2004 Imposible no hacernos mirar y luego, un nudo en la garganta. pic.twitter.com/A7zvz5440q

“Impossible not make us look, then, a lump in the throat,” the tweet reads.

The Vatican includes high-ranking dignitaries, priests, nuns, and guards as well as about 3,000 lay workers who comprise the majority of the work force. The Holy See's diplomatic history began in the fourth century, but the boundaries of the papacy's temporal power have shifted over the centuries. From the 8th century through the middle of the 19th century, the Popes held sway over the Papal States, which included a broad band of territory across central Italy. In 1860, after prolonged civil and regional unrest, Victor Emmanuel's army seized the Papal States, leaving only Rome and surrounding coastal regions under papal control. In 1870, Victor Emmanuel captured Rome itself and declared it the new capital of Italy, ending papal claims to temporal power. Pope Pius IX and his successors disputed the legitimacy of these acts and proclaimed themselves to be ""prisoners"" in the Vatican. Finally, in 1929, the Italian Government and the Holy See signed three agreements resolving the dispute: A treaty recognizing the independence and sovereignty of the Holy See and creating the State of the Vatican City; A concordat defining the relations between the government and the church within Italy; and A financial convention providing the Holy See with compensation for its losses in 1870. A revised concordat, altering the terms of church-state relations, was signed in 1984.",1
Clinton Campaign Circulated Paul Ryan Relative as Possible Supreme Court Pick,"Another reason as to why Ryan tried to sabotage Trump’s campaign? 
Paul Joseph Watson Prison Planet.com October 27, 2016 Hillary Clinton’s campaign circulated the name of one of Paul Ryan’s relatives as a potential Supreme Court pick, suggesting a conflict of interest that could feed in to the Republican Speaker of the House’s dislike for Donald Trump. An email released in part 19 of the Wikileaks Podesta dump features an article sent by Hillary advisor Sara Solow to Clinton campaign chairman John Podesta and Hillary’s foreign policy advisor Jake Sullivan on February 29, 2016. The piece draws attention to Ketanji Brown Jackson, a judge on the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia. “She was confirmed by without any Republican opposition in the Senate not once, but *twice*. She was confirmed to her current position in 2013 by unanimous consent – that is, without any stated opposition. She was also previously confirmed unanimously to a seat on the U.S. Sentencing Commission (where she became vice chair),” reads the email. “Her family is impressive. She is married to a surgeon and has two young daughters. Her father is a retired lawyer and her mother a retired school principal. Her brother was a police officer (in the unit that was the basis for the television show *The Wire*) and is now a law student, and she is related by marriage to Congressman (and Speaker of the House) Paul Ryan.” Earlier this month, Ryan said that he would no longer defend or campaign for Donald Trump. A poll released this week found that nearly two thirds of Republicans trust Donald Trump more than Ryan to lead the GOP. Many Trump supporters speculated that Ryan was involved in the leaking of the infamous Billy Bush tape, in which Trump made lewd comments about women, as part of a plot to sabotage the Republican nominee’s campaign. Could the fact that one of his relatives is being touted as a likely Clinton Supreme Court pick be another reason as to why Ryan – who has been accused by many of being in bed with the Washington establishment – has abandoned his support for Donald Trump?

NATO Buildup in Eastern Europe: ‘We’ve Only Seen the Tip of the Iceberg’,"Sputnik October 27, 2016 
NATO and Washington’s activities in Eastern Europe and the Baltics de facto amount to permanent military presence, Sergei Ermakov, a senior analyst at the Russian Institute for Strategic Studies, told RT, adding that we have seen “only the tip of the iceberg” so far. “Endless war-games and rotational deployments essentially amount to permanent military presence. NATO is testing a drastic military buildup. We have witnessed the alliance deploy expeditionary forces and assault troops to Eastern Europe. These are offensive, not defensive forces. What we have seen is only the tip of the iceberg,” Ermakov said. 
The North Atlantic Alliance has pledged to refrain from deploying substantial forces along the NATO-Russia border on a permanent basis, but has been increasingly active in the region. The bloc approved its largest military buildup in Eastern Europe and the Baltics since the end of the Cold War at the 2016 Warsaw summit, a development viewed with deep concern in Moscow. 
As part of this initiative, Canada, Germany, the UK and the US will establish and lead four battle groups expected to be deployed in Poland, Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania. Each will total up to 1,000 soldiers. These battalions are said to become operational in early 2017. The alliance has justified its massive buildup by blaming Russia for its ostensibly “assertive” behavior. Moscow has consistently denied these groundless claims. 
Ermakov further explained that forces of NATO’s European members are not as lethal as they might seem. “On paper this is a force exceeding Russia’s [military] potential by several times. But it lacks real combat power. This is why Americans need to be everywhere. The US was forced to boost US European Command’s budget,” he said. 
Earlier this year, the Pentagon requested $3.4bn for its operations in Europe in 2017, a four-time increase compared to its $789-million budget this year. A d v e r t i s e m e n t 
Russian officials and experts have repeatedly pointed out that NATO increasing assertiveness has put regional stability at risk. 
The bloc’s muscle flexing and aggressive rhetoric “greatly reduce European security and the chances for a revival of constructive dialogue between Russia and NATO, something Russia has been calling for so many years. Instead, the bloc is doing its best to provoke an arms race with unpredictable results,” Peter Korzun, an expert on wars and conflicts, wrote for the Strategic Culture Foundation. Ermakov also said that the United States wants to increase its presence in the Black Sea region to counter Russia. “Americans can no longer count on Turkey due to the failed coup attempt. Ankara has become a complicated partner. [Washington] is instead focusing on Bulgaria and Romania,” he said. 
NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg mentioned Romania during a press conference held following the latest meeting of NATO’s defense ministers. He said that Romanian troops will join the US-led battle group in Poland. He also said that the ministers discussed progress made in strengthening NATO’s presence in the Black Sea region “in the air, at sea and on land.” This initiative will include among other things “a Romanian-led multinational framework brigade on land,” he observed, providing no additional information on the subject. 
Ermakov further said that Washington also wants to counter Russia in Central Asia and the Asia-Pacific region. This article was posted: Thursday, October 27, 2016 at 6:39 am Share this article",1
Leaked Memo Exposes Shady Dealings Between Clinton Foundation Donors And Bill’s “For-Profit” Activities,"Zero Hedge October 27, 2016 
We have written frequently in recent weeks about a feud that erupted between Chelsea Clinton and Doug Band back in 2011 after Chelsea raised concerns about potential conflicts of interest between Band’s firm, Teneo, the Clinton Foundation and the State Department(see here , here, here and here ). 
The feud ultimately resulted in Band being forced to draft a memo spelling out, in vivid detail, the many entangled relationships between himself, Teneo, the Clinton Foundation and the State Department. Fortunately, today’s Wikileaks dump included that memo which reveals, for the first time, the precise financial flows between the Clinton Foundation, Band’s firm Teneo Consulting, and the Clinton family’s private business endeavors. 
The memo starts with a brief background on Teneo, which was created in June 2011, shortly after Declan Kelly resigned from his position as “United States Economic Envoy to Northern Ireland,” a position to which he was appointed by Secretary Clinton. 
In June 2009, DK Consulting was founded by Declan Kelley. Mr. Kelly served as COO of FTI Consulting until June 2009, when he stepped down and established DK Consulting. At that time, he also became the United States Economic Envoy to Northern Ireland . Pursuant to the terms of his exit agreement with FTI and consistent with the ethics agreement of his uncompensated special government employee appointment at the State Department, Mr. Kelly retained and continued to provide services to three paying clients (Coke, Dow, and UBS) and one pro bono client (Allstate) . In late 2009, Declan retained me as a consultant to DK Consulting to help support the needs of these clients. In May 2011, Mr. Kelly resigned his Envoy position at the State Department. In June 2011, Mr. Kelly and I founded Teneo Strategies ; simultaneously, Mr. Kelly closed DK Consulting and shifted its clients to Teneo. 
Throughout the past almost 11 years since President Clinton left office, I have sought to leverage my activities, including my partner role at Teneo, to support and to raise funds for the Foundation . This memorandum strives to set forth how I have endeavored to support the Clinton Foundation and President Clinton personally. 
In a subsequent section of the memo entitled “Leveraging Teneo For The Foundation,” Band spells all of the donations he solicited from Teneo “clients” for the Clinton Foundation. In all, there are roughly $14mm of donations listed with the largest contributors being Coca-Cola, Barclays, The Rockefeller Foundation and Laureate International Universities. 
The donations from Dow Chemical are particularly notable for several reasons. First, because of other emails revealed by WikiLeaks and other FOIA requests, we now know that Dow Chemical CEO, Andrew Liveris, was granted special access to then Secretary Clinton back in July 2009 at the same time he was embroiled in ongoing litigation with another Clinton Foundation donor, Kuwait, over a failed joint-venture that would have netted Dow $9BN in cash . As Band notes in his memo, 1 month after being granted special access to Secretary Clinton, Liveris invited President Clinton and Band out for a day of golf. Moreover, shortly after his meeting with Secretary Clinton and golf outing with President Clinton, Liveris decided to donate $500,000 to the Clinton Global Initiative …very convenient timing for all involved. 
In August of 2009, Mr. Kelly invited Mr. Liveris to play golf with President Clinton and me. Mr. Kelly subsequently asked Dow to become a CGI sponsor at the $500,000 level, which they did , as well as making a $150,000 donation to the Foundation for President Clinton to attend a Dow dinner in Davos. 
The story gets even more bizarre when Band reveals in the following footnote that Liveris provided the Dow Chemical plane to fly President Clinton and his staff from New York to California and then California to North Korea for their golf outing . We would assume this is a simple typo by Band and/or he’s just geographically challenged…if not, this certainly raises a whole other set of questions for Bill. 
Mr. Liveris provided the Dow plane to fly President Clinton and his staff to and from California for our trip to, and from, North Korea . As a private trip, the Foundation had to pay the costs of airfare; Mr. Liveris’ in kind contribution saved the Foundation in excess of $100,000 . 
According to the Dialy Caller , Dow Chemical paid Teneo $2.8 million in 2011 and $16 million in 2012 for a variety of “consultancy services”. Of course, Bill Clinton was an honorary chairman of Teneo and, as such, was set to be paid $3.5 million for that position even though he ultimately only kept $100,000 because of the scandals that erupted around the firm, including their advisory relationship with MF Global. 
Finally, Band also offers the following commentary on the “$50 million in for-profit activity” he was able to secure for Bill Clinton (as of November 2011) as well as the “$66 million in future contracts, should he choose to continue with those engagements.” 
Independent of our fundraising and decision-making activities on behalf of the Foundation, we have dedicated ourselves to helping the President secure and engage in for-profit activities – including speeches, books, and advisory service engagements . In that context, we have in effect served as agents, lawyers, managers and implementers to secure speaking, business and advisory service deals. In support of the President’s for-profit activity, we also have solicited and obtained, as appropriate, in-kind services for the President and his family – for personal travel, hospitality, vacation and the like. Neither Justin nor I are separately compensated for these activities (e.g., we do not receive a fee for, or percentage of, the more than $50 million in for-profit activity we have personally helped to secure for President Clinton to date or the $66 million in future contracts, should he choose to continue with those engagements). With respect to business deals for his advisory services, Justin and I found, developed and brought to President Clinton multiple arrangements for him to accept or reject. Of his current 4 arrangements, we secured all of them; and, we have helped manage and maintain all of his for-profit business relationships. Since 2001, President Clinton’s business arrangements have yielded more than $30 million for him personally, with $66 million to be paid out over the next nine years should he choose to continue with the current engagements. 
A big part of those “for-profit” activities was a $3.5mm annual payment from Laureate… 
…and millions in speaking fees arranged by Band. 
Confused? Here is a simpler recap from the NYT’s Nick Confessore: This Doug Band memo, in the latest Podesta dump, is the Rosetta stone of the Teneo-Clinton Foundation complex. https://t.co/a1g3nSoGPM 
— Nick Halloween (@nickconfessore) October 26, 2016 Band's argument: I am not get fully compensated for all of the stuff I do for Clintonworld, so you should let me do Teneo. Everyone wins. 
— Nick Halloween (@nickconfessore) October 26, 2016 Now, you could argue: So what? If Band gets his clients to pop over money to a charity, why is that bad? 
— Nick Halloween (@nickconfessore) October 26, 2016 But consider that Band was selling his clients on idea that giving to foundation was, in essence, a way to bolster their influence. 
— Nick Halloween (@nickconfessore) October 26, 2016 Clinton & Band built a platform for executives to bolster their companies' images, bathe in BC's praise, and do some good, while… 
— Nick Halloween (@nickconfessore) October 26, 2016 …Teneo extracted earnings for Band and, depending on what you see in these e-mails, Clinton himself. Teneo paid Clinton until late '11. 
— Nick Halloween (@nickconfessore) October 26, 2016 I guess you can wave it all off as a nothingburger. But Chelsea Clinton and some of Clinton's other aides were clearly freaking out. 
— Nick Halloween (@nickconfessore) October 26, 2016 Generally, the emails show Clinton's *own closest aides* troubled or horrified by things that her surrogates have spent years waving off.

Let’s Be Clear – A Vote For Warmonger Hillary Clinton Is A Vote For World War 3,"End Of The American Dream October 27, 2016 
If you want to see war without end, vote for Hillary Clinton. It is tremendously ironic that Hillary Clinton and the mainstream media have attempted to portray Donald Trump as “dangerous” and “temperamental”, because it is Clinton that actually has a long history of being emotionally unstable. 
She has a temper that is absolutely legendary, and she has been cussing out the men and women in her security detail for decades . Hillary Clinton played a key role in starting the civil war in Syria, thanks to her Libya is a post-apocalyptic wasteland today, and now she is picking a fight with the Russians before she has even won the election. Of all the candidates there were running for president this election cycle, there was nobody that was even close to as dangerous as Hillary Clinton, and if she wins the election I am fully convinced that World War 3 will begin before her time in the White House is over. 
Someone that shares this opinion with me is Donald Trump. According to Reuters , Trump recently stated that we are “going to end up in World War Three over Syria if we listen to Hillary Clinton”… 
On Syria’s civil war, Trump said Clinton could drag the United States into a world war with a more aggressive posture toward resolving the conflict. 
Clinton has called for the establishment of a no-fly zone and “safe zones” on the ground to protect non-combatants. Some analysts fear that protecting those zones could bring the United States into direct conflict with Russian fighter jets. 
“What we should do is focus on ISIS. We should not be focusing on Syria,” said Trump as he dined on fried eggs and sausage at his Trump National Doral golf resort. “You’re going to end up in World War Three over Syria if we listen to Hillary Clinton.” 
In order to have a no-fly zone in Syria, you would have to enforce it. 
And in order to enforce it, you would have to be willing to shoot at the Russians. 
According to National Intelligence Director James Clapper , that could have dire consequences… 
Russia could shoot down a U.S. aircraft if a no-fly zone were imposed over Syria, National Intelligence Director James Clapper said Tuesday. 
“I wouldn’t put it past them to shoot down an American aircraft if they felt that was threatening to their forces on the ground,” Clapper said, speaking with CBS’ Charlie Rose at the Council on Foreign Relations in New York about several national security issues. 
Of course Clapper is not alone in that assessment. The Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, General Joseph Francis Dunford, says that imposing a no-fly zone over all of Syria “would require us to go to war” … 
“Right now, Senator, for us to control all of the airspace in Syria it would require us to go to war, against Syria and Russia,… That’s a pretty fundamental decision that certainly I’m not going to make.” ( Senate Armed Services Committee, September 22, 2016, emphasis added) 
But Hillary Clinton is unwavering in her position that this is what she wants. 
You see, the truth is that Hillary Clinton wants to win the war that she started in Syria. Back in 2011, she spearheaded an effort along with Saudi Arabia and Turkey to try to use the Arab Spring uprisings in the Middle East as an opportunity to try to overthrow President Assad in Syria. If it wasn’t for her meddling, millions of refugees would not be pouring into Europe and elsewhere, and there would be no “humanitarian crisis” in Syria at all. 
Thanks to Russian intervention, the war in Syria is not too far from being over, but the Obama administration is desperate to keep it going. They understand that if Assad is victorious that all of their efforts for the last five years have been wasted, and that is why they are so determined to keep Aleppo from falling. Without Aleppo, many of the jihadist rebels that the Obama administration has been supporting won’t have anywhere to hide. 
So the Obama administration has actually been considering direct strikes against the Syrian military, and the Russians have already said that they will not allow this to happen . If Obama is insane enough to order airstrikes against Syrian forces and the Russians start shooting back, that could set off a chain of events that could rapidly spiral completely out of control. 
One recent survey found that current American leadership has a 1 percent approval rating in Russia right now, and the Russians dislike Hillary Clinton even more than they dislike Barack Obama. The Russians know that if Hillary Clinton is elected that it is quite likely that they will have to fight a war with us, and that is why they desperately want Donald Trump to win in November. You can see this outlook reflected in comments that Russian President Vladimir Putin recently made about the two candidates … 
“Mrs. Clinton has chosen to take up a very aggressive stance against our country, against Russia. Mr. Trump, on the other hand, calls for cooperation – at least when it comes to the international fight against terrorism,” Putin said. 
“Naturally we welcome those who would like to cooperate with us. And we consider it wrong, that we always have to be in conflict with one another, creating existential threats for each other and for the whole world,” Putin noted. 
Anyone that watched the three presidential debates could see that Hillary Clinton is absolutely seething with animosity for Russia. The thought of her finger on the nuclear trigger is almost too terrible to contemplate, but it may soon become a reality. 
And even now, the Obama administration and our NATO allies are shifting forces into position for a confrontation with Moscow. This week it is being reported that NATO troops will soon be sent to Poland, Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania … Nine hundred US troops are to be sent to eastern Europe next year as America’s troubled relationship with Russia enters new, uncertain territory. A US-led battle group of NATO allied soldiers will be sent to Poland as part of the multi-nation operation. British forces will lead one of the four battle groups in Estonia, Canada will spearhead the presence in Latvia and Germany will be present in Lithuania. 
In addition, Infowars is reporting that U.S. Marines will soon be stationed in Norway near the border with Russia… 
After accepting a Pentagon proposal, Norway will host US Marines at a base near the Russian border as Russia deploys nuclear-capable ships to Kaliningrad. 
A rotating force of approximately 330 Marines will be stationed at an airfield in the city of Vaernes, just outside Trondheim, beginning in January. Norway and Russia share an 122-mile border in the Arctic. 
“The US initiative to augment their training and exercises in Norway by locating a Marine Corps Rotational Force in Norway is highly welcome and will have positive implications for our already strong bilateral relationship,” said Norwegian Defense Minister Ine Eriksen Søreide. 
Most Americans aren’t aware of any of this, nor do they really care about our relationship with Russia. 
But in Russia things are completely different. The possibility of war with the United States is the biggest news story over there these days , and feverish preparations are being made for a potential nuclear confrontation … 
Russian authorities have stepped up nuclear-war survival measures amid a showdown with Washington, dusting off Soviet-era civil-defense plans and upgrading bomb shelters in the biggest cities. 
At the Kremlin’s Ministry of Emergency Situations, the Cold War is back. 
The country recently held its biggest civil defense drills since the collapse of the U.S.S.R., with what officials said were 40 million people rehearsing a response to chemical and nuclear threats. 
I know that I have been writing about this over and over , but the truth is that we are on a path to war with Russia, and the election of Hillary Clinton would greatly accelerate the march toward war. 
In my controversial new book , I expressed my belief that war with Russia is coming, but at the time that I wrote it I didn’t know how the election would turn out. 
At this point it looks like Clinton is very likely to win on November 8th, and that would be absolutely disastrous for our relationship with Russia. 
If you are reading this and you are considering voting for Hillary Clinton, please don’t do it . We simply cannot afford to have an emotionally unstable warmonger with a violent temper in the White House at this critical time. 
If the American people do choose Hillary Clinton this November, I believe that it will be a choice that they will bitterly, bitterly regret in future years. This article was posted: Thursday, October 27, 2016 at 6:01 am Share this article",1
"UK economy grows 0.5pc in the wake of Brexit vote, defying recession fears","London Telegraph October 27, 2016 
B ritain’s economy expanded by 0.5pc in the three months following the EU referendum, slowing down a touch from the 0.7pc growth recorded in the previous quarter but defying the most pessimistic predictions made by the Remain campaign. 
The country’s economic performance was stronger than the 0.3pc predicted by economists, and in line with the official forecasts made before the referendum took place – in March the Office for Budget Responsibility predicted third quarter growth of 0.5pc. It also disproves the Treasury’s referendum campaign claim that a vote to leave the EU would r esult in 0.1pc fall in GDP in the third quarter that would herald the start of a recession. The Treasury’s worst-case “severe shock” scenario was even more pessimistic, predicting a 1pc fall in the three-month period. 
S terling rallied on the initial estimates from the Office for National Statistics, and economists said the unexpectedly strong numbers made it less likely that the Bank of England’s monetary policy committee (MPC) would cut interest rates at next month’s monetary policy committee meeting.

Fascism? Environmentalists Force Coal Plant Closure. Town’s Economy Hit HARD…,"Louder With Crowder October 27, 2016 
Sometimes a thin layer of crust accumulates on the surface of the ocean, mostly made up of fecal matter and trash. It’s where environmentalists come from. 
They are, effectively, the pits. Also, environmentalists hate people (see Top 5 Environmentalists Who Openly Support Killing Off Humans ). A side effect of being sad, soggy little bottom dwellers. So it’s no surprise they want to kill off coal mines in Montana , despite the fact that said coal mines are pillars which help support the economy and the town’s well being. Also electric cars , but whatever: 
The 2,300 residents in Southeast Montana face an uphill battle to keep the city alive against an onslaught of legal battles and a major anti-coal crusade launched by outsiders. 
An out of court agreement was reached to close two of the four units of Colstrip’s coal-fired power plant by 2022. The Sierra Club and the Montana Environmental Information Center, which sued the plant, see the closure as a victory. 
Plant operators came to an agreement with activists [because] Oregon Democratic Gov. signed legislation mandating the state be coal-free by 2030… 
Consequences. 
It’s a win for everybody. Except the people employed by the coal plant… Also, Colstrip’s entire economy. Coal plant workers make money, then spend that money at other businesses. Except now all those lads will be jobless, which means they won’t be spending money or helping to boost the economy as much anymore, which means other businesses will suffer. Thanks environmentalists. 
By the way, “Green Earth” SJWs tend to also be fans of the Indians . The people, not the baseball team. Racist. That wee tidbit is worth noting, considering how their eco-friendly plan isn’t very native-friendly… 
“You lose two of those units, and you are shutting down half the town,” Small said. “This closure will have an economic impact on the reservations, throughout the County and across the State…” Small is of North Cheyenne descent. He’s made an extra effort to recruit American Indian students… Nearly three dozen Northern Cheyenne work at the Colstrip plant, and three times that figure work in the coal fields. 
A double header. Bad for the economy, bad for the indigenous people. 
As mentioned above, the coal plant never stood a chance. Thanks to impending regulations, the plant has long seen the end drawing near. Possibly because they would rather close indefinitely in order to be spared from ever having to hear another squawking lobbyist attempt to “talk” them into seeing things their way. Whatever the reason, environmentalists and the state teamed up to bully the coal plant into shutting down. Now the future of an entire town lies in jeopardy. 
Environmentalists happily stomped their cloven hooves all over people’s livelihoods. But hey, less smog. #Caring

College warns against ‘deplorable and problematic’ costumes,"College Reform October 27, 2016 
Grinnell College is promoting a guide to help students avoid “cultural appropriation” this Halloween, warning that some costumes could be considered “deplorable and problematic.” 
The guide provides several examples of costumes that might fit the definition of “cultural appropriation,” defining the term as “the act of displaying people’s cultures in a disrespectful or condescending manner.” 
The guide, called “My Identity, Not Your Costume,” goes on to list several examples of “offensive” Halloween costumes, featuring pictures of Grinnell students holding photos of costumes that would be considered disrespectful towards their culture. 
In one instance, the guide shows a picture of a burly white man dressed in lingerie with a sash proclaiming “Call me Caitlyn,” referring to Caitlyn Jenner. The photo is held by a Grinnell student wearing a “National Coming Out Day” pin, and includes a caption stating, “the misrepresentation of my identity bothers me because people categorize me by my looks and may not understand my culture.” 
Another example of culturally appropriated Halloween costumes, according to the guide, is “using other cultures as accessories to appear more hip/interesting without adequate understanding or permission,” one example of which is a picture of someone dressed as a Hindu deity being held by an Indian student and the message that such costumes are “deplorable and problematic.” 
It then warns students that if their costumes take “defining characteristics of another culture” without “permission, or understanding of the historical background behind the said culture,” then these costumes might be too offensive to wear. 
The guide then concludes with two questions the school thinks students should consider before selecting a Halloween costume, asking, “Does your costume perpetuate stereotypes or inaccurately portray my culture as a joke?” as well as “Why would I find your ‘Halloween costume’ to be offensive?” 
Campus Reform reached out to Grinnell for a comment on the matter but did not receive a response in time for publication. This article was posted: Thursday, October 27, 2016 at 5:53 am Share this article",1
Meet Peter Kadzik – Another Clinton Stooge at the Justice Department,"Liberty Blitzkrieg October 27, 2016 
The name Peter Kadzik probably doesn’t ring a bell for many of you, although it probably should. This guy is a real piece of work, as an excellent article published earlier today at the Daily Caller demonstrates. 
Here’s some of what we learned: 
The day after Hillary Clinton testified in front of the House Select Committee on Benghazi last October, John Podesta, the Democrat’s campaign chairman, met for dinner with a small group of well-connected friends, including Peter Kadzik, a top official at the Justice Department. 
The dinner arrangement, revealed in hacked Podesta emails released by WikiLeaks, is just the latest example of an apparent conflict of interest between the Clinton campaign and the federal agency charged with investigating the former secretary of state’s email practices. 
Podesta and Kadzik, the assistant attorney general for legislative affairs, were in frequent contact, other emails show. In one email from January, Kadzik and Podesta, who were classmates at Georgetown Law School in the 1970s, discussed plans to celebrate Podesta’s birthday. And in another sent last May, Kadzik’s son emailed Podesta asking for a job on the Clinton campaign. 
“The political appointees in the Obama administration, especially in the Department of Justice, appear to be very partisan in nature and I don’t think had clean hands when it comes to the investigation of the private email server,” says Matthew Whitaker, the executive director of the Foundation for Accountability and Civic Trust, a government watchdog group. 
Kadzik, who started at the DOJ in 2013, helped spearhead the effort to nominate Lynch, who was heavily criticized for her secret meeting with the former president. 
Kadzik represented Podesta during the Monica Lewinsky investigation. And in the waning days of the Bill Clinton administration, Kadzik lobbied Podesta on behalf of Marc Rich, the fugitive who Bill Clinton controversially pardoned on his last day in office. 
In a Sept. 2008 email , which the Washington Free Beacon flagged last week, Podesta emailed an Obama campaign official to recommend Kadzik for a supportive role in the campaign. 
Podesta, who would later head up the Obama White House transition effort, wrote that Kadzik was a “fantastic lawyer” who “kept me out of jail.” 
Podesta made false statements to a grand jury impaneled by Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr for the investigation. But he defended the falsehoods, saying later that he was merely relaying false information from Clinton that he did not know was inaccurate at the time. 
“He did lie to me,” Podesta said about Clinton in a National Public Radio interview in 1998. Clinton was acquitted by the Senate in Feb. 1999 of perjury and obstruction of justice charges related to the Lewinsky probe. 
Kadzik, then a lawyer with the firm Dickstein Shapiro Morin & Oshinsky, represented Podesta through the fiasco. 
Podesta had been promoted to Clinton’s chief of staff when he and Kadzik became embroiled in another scandal. 
Kadzik was then representing Marc Rich, a billionaire financier who was wanted by the U.S. government for evading a $48 million tax bill. The fugitive, who was also implicated in illegal trading activity with nations that sponsored terrorism, had been living in Switzerland for 17 years when he sought the pardon. 
To help Rich, Kadzik lobbied Podesta heavily in the weeks before Clinton left office on Jan. 20, 2001. 
A House Oversight Committee report released in May 2002 stated that “Kadzik was recruited into Marc Rich’s lobbying campaign because he was a long-time friend of White House Chief of Staff John Podesta.” 
The report noted that Kadzik contacted Podesta at least seven times regarding Rich’s pardon. 
On top of the all-hands-on-deck lobbying effort, Rich’s ex-wife, Denise Rich, had doled out more than $1 million to the Clintons and other Democrats prior to the pardon. She gave $100,000 to Hillary Clinton’s New York Senate campaign and another $450,000 to the Clinton presidential library. 
The first mention of personal contact between Podesta and Kadzik in the WikiLeaks dump is in an Oct. 23, 2015 email sent out by Vincent Roberti, a lobbyist who is close to Podesta and his superlobbyist brother, Tony Podesta. In it, Roberti refers to a dinner reservation at Posto, a Washington D.C. restaurant. 
The dinner was set for 7:30 that evening, just a day after Clinton gave 11 hours of testimony to the Benghazi Committee. 
Podesta and Kadzik met several months later for dinner at Podesta’s home, another email shows . And in an email sent on May 5, 2015, Kadzik’s son asked Podesta for a job on the Clinton campaign. 
I’ll have the lobster risotto with a side of cronyism and middle class destruction. 
As head of the Office of Legislative Affairs, Kadzik handles inquiries from Congress on a variety of issues. In that role he was not in the direct chain of command on the Clinton investigation. 
The Justice Department and FBI have insisted that career investigators oversaw the investigation, which concluded in July with no charges filed against Clinton. 
But Kadzik worked on other Clinton email issues in his dealings with Congress. 
Last November, he denied a request from Republican lawmakers to appoint a special counsel to lead the investigation. 
Seems like a pretty important decision for a Clinton crony to make. 
The Justice Department declined to comment on the record for this article. 
Could the Department of Injustice have any less credibility?

Bill Clinton’s Lover: He Called Ruthless Hillary ‘The Warden’,"  Bill Clinton is a sex-addicted ‘monster’ who mocked Hillary Clinton by calling her ‘The Warden’ in front of friends and privately boasted about his high notch count, according to his long-time mistress and childhood friend Dolly Kyle. Kyle, now 68, says she had a decades-long affair with   before and during his marriage and had a front-row seat to Bill’s salacious double-life in the 1970s and ’80s. Their on-again, off-again relationship ended abruptly in the 1990s, after Bill Clinton allegedly threatened to ‘destroy’ Kyle if she spoke to the media about their relationship. Kyle’s decades of observations, shared in an interview with the DailyMail.com as well as in her 2016 book The Other Woman, provide a unique perspective on the Clintons’ marriage and the couple’s treatment of the women who have accused   of infidelity or sexual assault over the years. Kyle, an Arkansas native who has since befriended several of Bill Clinton’s sexual assault accusers, said she was determined to come forward with her story after hearing Hillary Clinton say on the campaign trail that women who have been sexually assaulted have the ‘right to be believed’.  35  ",1
Wikileaks memo: Bill Clinton raked in tens of millions of dollars through a series of deals while Hillary was Secretary of State,"  The latest hacked email released by WikiLeaks details how one of Bill Clinton’s closest aides helped rake in tens of millions for   while his wife was serving as Secretary of State. The 12-page memo was sent by Clinton’s former aide Doug Band in 2011 to him, his daughter Chelsea, several board members of the Clinton Foundation and its lawyers as well as its then special advisor John Podesta. Published on Wednesday by Wikileaks, after a hack of thousands of emails from Podesta’s account, it details how Band helped run what he called ‘Bill Clinton Inc.’ Band and another aide helped secure $66million from ventures, including speaking fees, according to the memo. 
He wrote that, using his role as the president of his own consulting firm Teneo, Band worked to raise funds for the Foundation and Clinton personally.  29  ",1

Video: ‘Rude’ CNN Reporter Asks Trump Why He’s Taking Time Off To Open A Hotel,"Meanwhile Hillary Clinton is at home sleeping 
Steve Watson Prison Planet.com October 27, 2016 
GOP nominee Donald Trump took time out of a relentless campaign schedule Wednesday to spend around an hour opening a new hotel, prompting one CNN reporter to accuse Trump of “taking time out of swing states.” Meanwhile Hillary Clinton is again nowhere to be seen. 
CNN’s Dana Bash suggested that Trump should be more concerned with campaigning in swing states, yet Trump had three campaign stops scheduled for the same day. Dana Bash: Is your DC hotel opening free advertising?Donald Trump: “No, not at all” https://t.co/6OZtrfIwim https://t.co/9HHqooom8r 
— CNN Politics (@CNNPolitics) October 26, 2016 
“So to people who say you’re taking time out of swing states to go do this, you say?” Bash asked. 
“I say the following: You have been covering me for the last — long time. I did yesterday eight stops and three major speeches, and I’ve been doing this for weeks straight,” Trump responded. 
“For you to ask me that question is actually very insulting because Hillary Clinton does one stop and then she goes home and sleeps. And yet you’ll ask me that question. I think that’s a very rude question, to be honest with you.” Trump exclaimed. 
Trump added that the opening of the hotel also served to prove a point that he can get things built under budget and ahead of schedule, suggesting that the country needs to be able to follow suit. 
While CNN has continuously run defense for Hillary Clinton amid a myriad of scandals, and even rigged its own polls to suggest she won the debates, the network has been forced to admit that Hillary is running an extremely light campaign schedule. 
Last month, for example, Hillary went six days without an event except for a short speech she gave in Orlando, Florida. 
And in August, Hillary took seven of the first 14 days of the month off and even went four days without a single campaign appearance. 
“Her speeches are so short – they don’t last long, they’re like 10 minutes and ‘let’s get out of here,’” Donald Trump said about her schedule. “Go back home and go to sleep.” This article was posted: Thursday, October 27, 2016 at 8:12 am Share this article",1

Trump Warns Of ‘Vote Flipping’ On Machines,"“People are not happy. BIG lines. What is going on?” 
Steve Watson Prison Planet.com October 27, 2016 
GOP Nominee Donald Trump, who has for weeks warned that the election could be rigged against him, shot out a tweet Thursday indicating that he is aware of reports of machines ‘flipping’ to register votes for Hillary Clinton, when voters choose Trump. 
“A lot of call-ins about vote flipping at the voting booths in Texas,” Trump tweeted. 
“People are not happy. BIG lines. What is going on?” A lot of call-ins about vote flipping at the voting booths in Texas. People are not happy. BIG lines. What is going on? 
— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) October 27, 2016 
As Infowars has highlighted , there have already been numerous reports of early voters in Texas seeing their ballots flipped from Donald Trump to Hillary Clinton. A d v e r t i s e m e n t 
While election officials have dismissed the reports, suggesting ‘user error’ is to blame, tech experts have long warned that the machines can become less accurate over time. 
Larry Norden, a voting technology expert, told NPR that the reports usually arise where outdated technology is being employed. 
“Over time, as people vote, that calibration becomes less and less accurate,” Norden noted. 
During elections over the past decade and more there have been reports of voting machines ‘flipping’. Indeed, the reports were so widespread that even entertainment shows such as The Simpsons drew attention to it: 
Meanwhile, The Washington Post has admitted that the press is engaging in voter suppression, bizarrely claiming it is a legitimate way of countering Trump’s ‘rigged’ election claims. 
Callum Borchers, author at the Washington Post blog The Fix writes: Since the final presidential debate last week, many news outlets have been delivering an unvarnished message to Donald Trump supporters: Your candidate is virtually certain to lose the election Nov. 8. A day later, the Times’s Upshot blog increased Clinton’s chances of winning to 93 percent , an all-time high. On Monday, Politico’s Ben Schreckinger wrote that “ Donald Trump’s path to an election night win is almost entirely closed .” Here at The Fix, Chris Cillizza and Aaron Blake wrote that “ Donald Trump’s chances of winning are approaching zero .” These are accurate, statistically sound statements. But they are something else, too. Declarations that Trump is highly unlikely to win also serve as counters to the Republican nominee’s warning that the “rigged” election could be “ stolen from us .” 
The latest polls, which Trump insists are rigged due to oversampling, show Clinton with a double digit lead. 
However, Hillary Clinton’s campaign manager Robby Mook has warned that Trump’s suggestions that the polls are wrong and he can still win are “absolutely right.” 
“We’ve seen polls tighten since the third debate and we expect things to get even closer before Election Day.” Mook said, urging Clinton supporters to vote. 
“Make no mistake. With only 10 percent of votes cast, Donald Trump could win this election,” Mook said.   9:15  ",1
Netflix and PILL: Streaming firm boss reveals the future of TV could be a Matrix-style hallucinatory drug,"Daily Mail October 27, 2016 As entertainment firms fight to stay ahead of virtual and augmented reality systems, Netflix CEO Reed Hastings is keeping tabs on hallucinogenic drugs. At the Wall Street Journal Live conference on Tuesday, Hastings discussed potential challenges the streaming service may face in the future, including ‘pharmacological’ competition. The chief executive went on to describe a Matrix-like scenario in which users could take a ‘blue pill’ to experience hallucinatory entertainment and a ‘white pill’ to come back to reality – and says it could happen in the next twenty years. 
At the WSJ conference, Hastings explained that the firm is working hard to draw users’ attention away from apps, social media, and other major competitors, TechCrunch reports.   8:48  ",1
Republicans in Congress are ready for Hillary as they prepare for new probes into Clinton Foundation,"Daily Mail October 27, 2016 Republicans say they’ll keep the heat on Hillary Clinton if she wins the Oval Office with new investigations into her family charity and quid pro quo allegations. Judicial Watch, a conservative group that’s been at the forefront of Clinton’s email scandal, is already talking impeachment for the not-yet president. ‘I know this generation of Republican leaders is loath to exercise these tools, but impeachment is something that’s relevant,’ the organization’s president, Tom Fitton, told NBC News. Fitton noted, however, that congressional Republicans were unlikely to follow his advice. ‘They see [the oversight process] as an opportunity in some measure to keep their opponents off-kilter, but they don’t want to do the substantive and principled work to truly hold corrupt politicians, or the administration, or anyone accountable,’ he charged. Republicans on Capitol Hill are gearing up for a bevy of new investigations involving Clinton in the next Congress.   8:32  ",1
MSNBC’s Scarborough Zings: The Media Is ‘Aggressively Taken Sides and They’ve Admitted’ to it!,"Newsbusters October 27, 2016 
On Wednesday’s Morning Joe , co-host Joe Scarborough once again was forced to actually tell the truth about the liberal bias in media coverage throughout this entire election. 
Scarborough, a former Florida Republican congressman, began the discussion stating that: 
“[A]s a Republican there’s a natural reaction to press bias and it has been so overwhelming even if it is has been earned. The media has taken sides. They’ve aggressively taken sides and they’ve admitted that we’re aggressively taking sides and I think you get some Republicans that see that every four years. It’s so funny. They do that every four years. Every four years it’s like the end of the world if a Republican gets elected president because they’re all racist. It’s the boy that cried wolf.” 
In a sense, what was articulated is that the mass media’s historic liberal bias against conservatives is reflected in every election so much so that in this one, their usual partisan attacks against Trump’s controversial personality are not as effective. Also, Scarborough stated the fact shared by many conservatives that there is an overwhelming and aggressive agenda by the press to defend liberals. 
Furthermore, in conversation with frequent panelist Mike Barnicle, Scarborough added: “Also, it’s such a confounding election where we go back and forth on what it’s about, Mike Barnicle said all along that it’s about Hillary Clinton. People say ‘I’m going to vote for Hillary Clinton as a protest against…’ and then after sitting on that for a couple of weeks that thought for a couple weeks they go ‘eh…maybe not.’” 
In a way, they were all trying to explain how Trump is still almost tied to Clinton in a number of battleground state polls, despite the disproportionate amount of negative coverage. Later on in response to co-host Willie Geist’s remarks about the race being almost over, Scarborough proved his earlier point about the media’s disconnect: 
“I got to say, Willie. Everybody that is saying it’s over and you’re a fool if you’re suggesting that the American people may have the final say at the voting booth are the same people that were saying in August, September, October, November, December, January, February that there was no way in a million years that Donald Trump would ever win the Republican nomination. Stating it just as emphatically as they’re stating now that we need to avert our eyes, this race is over. “

Liberal CNN Commentator Blames Republicans for Obamacare’s Rising Premiums,"Washington Free Beacon October 27, 2016 
CNN commentator Angela Rye on Wednesday blamed the failure of Republicans to repeal and replace Obamacare for the newly announced double-digit premium increases in the president’s signature health care law. 
“It’s not just Hillary Clinton that needs to tackle this but also Congress,” Rye said on CNN’s New Day. “The reason we are in the position that we are in right now frankly, Alisyn, is because Republicans fell short of their promise to repeal, which is what they said they wanted to do, and replace.” 
Host Alisyn Camerota stopped Rye before she got any further and reminded her that President Obama had promised premiums would go down. 
Most states will see health care premiums under the Affordable Care Act increase by an average of 25 percent, according to data released this week by the Obama administration. Indiana will see its rates slightly go down, but other states like Arizona will see costs skyrocket by 116 percent. Members of the administration have been quick to soften the blow of the increase by reminding people that a majority of those on the Obamacare exchanges would be receiving tax credits to help pay for the now more expensive health insurance plans.   8:17  ",1
Mission accomplished? RT crew finds refugees still at ‘Jungle’ camp despite ‘successful’ eviction,"RT October 27, 2016 
Local authorities in Calais claim that the ‘Jungle’ refugee camp has been successfully evacuated, but according to an RT crew at the site, a number of refugees and migrants apparently remain at the half-demolished camp. 
Unlike the previous days and nights, the demolition of the site on Wednesday for the most part passed off peacefully. 
“This is the end of the ‘Jungle,'” Calais regional prefect Fabienne Buccio reported. “Mission accomplished.” 
The statement may be as premature as the one made in the same words by then US President George W Bush after the Iraq invasion in 2003. RT’s crew on the ground reports that dozens of people remain at the camp. 
“Soon after that statement was made we went inside and saw that there was either a massive blunder in terms of their public relations line or a lie. The camp was far from being evacuated and closed,” RT’s Harry Fear reported from the scene. 
On Thursday, Buccio warned that refugees arriving at the ‘Jungle’ camp in the future would not be offered resettlement, unlike those evacuated in recent days. 
“It is not Calais’ role to receive all the migrants of Europe. We do not want to create a vacuum. We have asked [those newly arrived] migrants to disperse,” she said. 
Earlier in the day, about 100 migrants were seen filing past police officers overseeing the camp demolition, Reuters reports.   6:43  ",1
"Dying out: Wild animal numbers could fall by 67% from 1970-2020, study says","RT October 27, 2016 
The number of wild animals on Earth could fall by more than two-thirds in the 50 years to 2020, according to a new report which places the blame on the destruction of habitats, hunting and pollution. The forecast could lead to major consequences for humans. 
The Living Planet Report 2016 says that animal losses are on track to reach 67 percent in the 50 years to 2020. The report’s authors also took into consideration a recent trend in animal population decline, citing a 58 percent plummet between 1970 and 2012. 
The researchers analyzed the changing presence of 14,152 monitored populations of the 3,706 vertebrate species – mammals, birds, fish, amphibians and reptiles among them. 
According to the paper, the biggest cause of the plummeting animal populations is the destruction of wilderness areas by farming and logging. Pollution was also mentioned as a significant problem.

“Humanity’s misuse of natural resources is threatening habitats, pushing irreplaceable species to the brink, and threatening the stability of our climate,” said WWF’s director of science, Mike Barrett. A d v e r t i s e m e n t 
Animals across the planet are expected to be affected. However, rivers and lakes are the hardest-hit areas. Barrett noted that global warming is exacerbating the pressures. 
“We are no longer a small world on a big planet. We are now a big world on a small planet, where we have reached a saturation point,” the Stockholm Resilience Center’s Professor Johan Rockström said in a foreword for the report. 
The decline in wildlife, along with climate change, is part of the proposed notion of Anthropocene, a term which suggests a new era in which humans have managed to have a significant global impact on Earth’s geology and ecosystems. 
The notion – which has yet to be officially approved as a term used to explain geological time – can lead to major consequences. 
“The richness and diversity of life on Earth is fundamental to the complex life systems that underpin it. Life supports life itself and we are part of the same equation. Lose biodiversity and the natural world and the life support systems, as we know them today, will collapse,” WWF Director-General Marco Lambertini said, as quoted by the Guardian. 
In fact, the report states that humans could be anything but happy if the forecast comes to fruition, noting that the predicted situation could provoke serious competition. 
“Increased human pressure threatens the natural resources that humanity depends upon, increasing the risk of water and food insecurity and competition over natural resources,” the report states. 
There does, however, appear to be some hope. Some species are beginning to recover, suggesting that conservation efforts could help tackle the crisis. 
However, Barrett noted that in order for such efforts to take place, society must largely change how it consumes resources. 
“You’d like to think that was a no-brainer in that if a business is consuming the raw materials for its products in a way that is not sustainable, then inevitably it will eventually put itself out of business,” Barrett said. 
“The report is certainly a pretty shocking snapshot of where we are,” he added. “My hope though is that we don’t throw our hands up in despair – there is no time for despair, we have to crack on and act. I do remain convinced we can find our sustainable course through the Anthropocene, but the will has to be there to do it.” 
The new report comes less than two months after a similar analysis found that Earth has lost one-tenth of its wilderness sites since the early 1990s.   6:41  ",1

Three Quarters Of Americans Oppose Gun Control,"Record numbers say no to proposed handgun ban 
Steve   
A new poll released by Gallup has found that a record amount of Americans are opposed to gun control measures . 
The survey found that 76 percent of respondents, over three quarters, believe that a ban on civilian ownership of handguns should not be made law. 
The findings represent a four-point increase on the same survey from last year, in addition to an all-time high for the past three decades. 
The poll also found that almost two thirds, 61 percent, are “against” a ban on semi-automatic rifles, or “assault weapons”as the corporate media refers to them. 
That figure represents a full ten-point increase on previous findings, and is an all time record high since polling began on the issue 20 years ago. 
Just 27 percent, less than a third, say they support a ban on handgun ownership, while only 36 percent, support a semi-automatic ban. an eight-point decline on previous findings. 
In addition, gun sales have been hitting record highs for months on end. 
In a summary of the new poll, Gallup seemed surprised, by the findings, describing waning support for a gun ban as a “paradox”: 
Perhaps paradoxically, opposition toward a ban has increased against a backdrop of multiple mass shootings and terrorist attacks in which the perpetrators used assault rifles. These guns were used in high-profile incidents, including the terrorist attacks in San Bernardino, California, and Orlando, and the mass shootings in Aurora, Colorado, and Newtown, Connecticut. 
The findings reveal just how out of step Hillary Clinton’s position on gun control is with the majority of Americans. 
Hillary is a staunch gun control proponent. Wikileaks releases have revealed that Hillary plans to implement strict gun control measures by executive order. 
Clinton purportedly plans to open gun manufacturers to lawsuits by crime victims, a move that critics say would do nothing to reduce crime, but would bankrupt–and eventually end–gun manufacturing in the United States.

Wikileaks Email: Clinton Operative Thinks “Black Voters Are Stupid”,"David Brock accused of “elitist racism” 
Paul Joseph   A new email released as part of the Wikileaks Podesta dump features Clinton ally Brent Budowsky accusing Hillary operative David Brock of having a plan that relied upon black voters being “stupid”. The email , sent to Clinton campaign chairman John Podesta and another Clinton ally CEO Roy Spence, centers around a discussion of a Bernie Sanders campaign ad which featured “many black faces”. Back in January, Clinton operative David Brock caused consternation within the campaign when he publicly claimed that Bernie Sanders didn’t care about black people. Budowsky is not impressed with Brock’s outburst, writing in the email, “Brock makes the cardinal mistake of those who bring politics into disrepute with voters. He tells a lie that people will know is a lie, and insults the intelligence of black voters with a kind of elitist racism that Bill and Hillary Clinton should not be seen with.” “I guess Brock’s plan is that black voters are stupid and will not watch the ad and believe his lie,” writes Budowsky. “I cannot think of anything more desperate, more stupid and more self-destructive than David Brock lying about the Bernie ad and playing a seamy brand of the politics of race using the tactic of deceit on her behalf,” adds the The Hill and Huffington Post columnist, before offering to write a campaign ad for HIllary to counter the Bernie Sanders ad. The email once again underscores the Clinton camp’s paranoia about not being able to authentically connect with African-American voters in a way that Bernie Sanders could. Some black voters have been reluctant to support Clinton as a result of her support for a 1994 crime bill that resulted in the mass incarceration of young black Americans, whom Hilary referred to at the time as “super predators”.

Britain joins biggest European military buildup since Cold War,"RT October 27, 2016 
Britain is deploying troops, aircraft and armor in the biggest military buildup in Eastern Europe since the Cold War. 
The deployment, which was first floated in the press by UK defense chiefs on Wednesday, appears to have been prepared well in advance. 
It will see up to 800 armored infantry troops deployed to Estonia and Royal Air Force (RAF) fighter jets deployed to Romania in what appears to be a reiteration of the strategy of containment employed against the Soviet Union during the Cold War. 
France and Denmark will also commit more troops. 
On Wednesday, UK Defence Secretary Michael Fallon struck a belligerent tone in the Wall Street Journal when he warned that Europe “ is our continent ” and, as such, would be defended. 
While he claimed the force would be “ defensive in nature ” he pledged it would be “ fully combat-capable. ” A d v e r t i s e m e n t 
He denied the placement of small formations around the Baltic area are merely a “ trip-wire ” in case of the much-heralded, but hypothetical, clash with Russia. 
“ This is a serious military presence, ” he said. 
Tensions have only just begun to subside after a fleet of Russian naval vessels bound for the Mediterranean Sea passed through the North Sea and English Channel. 
The passage caused a press frenzy in the UK, framed as though Russia was launching an invasion of the British Isles. The Royal Navy deployed destroyers to, in Fallon’s words, “ man-mark ” the vessels while the RAF overflew the ships with fighter jets. 
According to the Russian military, the naval group’s task was to “ ensure a naval presence in operationally significant areas of the world’s oceans, ” as well as “ the safety of maritime navigation and other maritime economic activities ” of Russia. 
Britain’s deployment of troops, drones and aircraft is expected to begin in May 2018. This article was posted: Thursday, October 27, 2016 at 6:45 am Share this article",1
Fox News Poll: Clinton leads Trump by three points,"FoxNews.com October 27, 2016 
With less than two weeks to go, the race for the White House has narrowed as Hillary Clinton now has a three-point advantage over Donald Trump. 
That’s within the margin of error of the national Fox News Poll of likely voters. 
Clinton is ahead of Trump by 44-41 percent. Another one-in-ten back a third-party candidate and four percent are undecided. Last week she was up by six points (45-39 percent) and before that by seven (45-38 percent). 
The poll, released Wednesday, finds Clinton leads 49-44 percent in the head-to-head matchup. That 5-point advantage is at the edge of the error margin. She was up 7 a week ago (49-42 percent). This article was posted: Thursday, October 27, 2016 at 6:33 am Share this article",1
MYSTERY: Are Hillary Clinton’s eye problems becoming more frequent?,"American Mirror October 27, 2016 
For at least the second time in the last several days, cameras captured Hillary Clinton’s eyes acting strangely. 
The behavior, which doctors have told The American Mirror appears to be “disconjugate gaze” — a common symptom of increased intracranial pressure, or swelling of the brain — was evident again during a rally on Wednesday in Lake Worth, Florida. 
Here are several more of the instances from today: 
Despite getting major coverage on The Drudge Report, no mainstream news outlet has covered the apparent issue with Clinton’s eyes. 
But the several instances over the last few weeks, and as recently as last Friday , have been enough for doctors to publicly call on Clinton to undergo a full medical example and release the results. 
“My rational self would say that they could have defused all this a long time ago by releasing her medical records and having her undergo the same type of neurologic exam that every high school football player in America who ‘gets his bell rung’ on Friday night must undergo before he can suit up for the game next Friday,” Dr. John R. Coppedge, a surgical specialist from Texas, told The American Mirror . A d v e r t i s e m e n t 
“She needs a full neurology evaluation, neuro-opthalmology evaluation, MRI, cerebral venography and a lumbar puncture,” Dr. Gerald Gianoli, an expert in intracranial pressure, said to this news site. 
“It is possible that her status could be significantly improved. But at the same time, she risks demonstrating to the public that her medical problems are more serious than she has let on in the past.” 
Gianoli, who believes the condition could be the result of elevated pressure, which can cause other problems. 
“It can lead to blindness, deafness, progressive vertigo/balance problems, seizures/stroke and continued problems with concentration, memory and ability to mentally focus,” he said. 
“It could also lead to death if the lateral sinus thrombosis were to progress to include the opposite side.” This article was posted: Thursday, October 27, 2016 at 5:57 am Share this article",1
Why So Few Whistleblowers? A Former CIA Agent's Story,"Why So Few Whistleblowers? A Former CIA Agent's Story « on: Today at 11:42:10 AM » Kevin Shipp is a major whistleblower coming from a solid background as a courageous, decorated CIA officer and anti terrorism expert. He held several high level positions in the CIA. A 2011 New York Times article describes the shocking details of Shipp's harrowing personal story of seeking justice and eventually turning whistleblower after his health and the health of his family were severely compromised.Running into the juggernaut faced by so many whistleblowers, Shipp ended up with both his marriage and his career destroyed. Yet in the end Shipp prevailed and managed to stay out of jail. He now speaks openly about both his own personal experiences and how the system works to silence and punish whistleblowers, and in so doing keep corruption and illegal activities at all levels covered up.Shipp's excellent essay below explains in detail why so few whistleblowers have come out on highly illegal activities related to Pentagon corruption, CIA manipulation and overthrow of governments, 9/11 shenanigans, secret mind control programs, and much more. His words show just how much courage it takes for people like Edward Snowden and Julian Assange to expose major government corruption. By spreading the word and calling for clear strong laws to protect whistleblowers, we can make a difference.With best wishes for a transformed world,Fred Burks for PEERS and WantToKnow.infoFormer White House interpreter and whistleblowerSilencing WhistleblowersBy Kevin ShippWhy dont more whistleblowers come out to expose illegal or unconstitutional secret government operations? If these activities are so illegal, why are people not coming forward to report them?Over the last fifty years US government intelligence agencies have perfected a complex, sequential system to systematically silence or destroy any employee, including his or her family, who attempts to reveal illegal or unconstitutional activities conducted as part of secret government operations.As a condition of employment, military and intelligence employees recruited for secret operations are required to sign a secrecy agreement, or nondisclosure agreement, before being given access to the position, which offers high pay and status in the organization. This agreement threatens civil and criminal penalties if the employee reveals ANY information regarding the program. Thinking the agreement will only be used for legal purposes and will get them the coveted job, all employees eagerly sign it.This secrecy agreement was originally designed to protect legitimate classified information, to protect military personnel during wartime and protect legitimate national defense information and technology.However, because of the binding power of the agreement, government agencies began using it as a powerful tool to silence federal employees who question the legality of certain government operations. It was the perfect tool to threaten, silence or jail any whistle blower who dared to challenge the secret operations of government.Today, the secrecy agreement is routinely used as an efficient weapon to intimidate or silence employees. Annual refresher briefings are given to remind employees of the penalties for violating the agreement. These penalties include huge fines, termination, financial ruin and even prison  all of which mean the destruction of their lives and their families. Most will not reveal any wrongdoing, no matter how egregious, for fear of calculated, severe retribution.When employees sign the secrecy agreement and are cleared for classified programs, they are not told they are giving up their right to a jury trial, or to sue the agency that hired them. If they try to do so as a whistle blower, they find they have no right to be heard in federal court. Many have found this out when their case was denied; then it was too late. That is part of the system.If the employee attempts to contact their Congressman or Senator, their representative is blocked from receiving any information about their case, because they do not have the necessary clearance.When the employee attempts to blow the whistle to the Congressional intelligence committees, their response is ignored. It is made clear to committee members that they are not to touch such cases, so they refer them back to their Senator or Congressman, who cannot access information involved in their case.If a courageous employee continues to proceed and blow the whistle, a system of personal and career destruction follows. This begins with promotions being denied, being turned down for sensitive or career enhancing assignments, and their files being flagged, ruining their reputation inside their agency. At this point their career is over. If they go quietly, the retribution stops.When the employee still continues their effort to report the information, their travel records, personnel records, medical records and security records are searched for mistakes or damaging information that can be used to threaten them with termination. Their telephones and computers are monitored searching for incriminating information. If no substantive information can be found, it is fabricated and placed in their file.Employees who refuse to back down are then subjected to internal security investigations, multiple, hostile interviews, attempting to get them to recant their information, and multiple polygraph interrogations.In many cases, the employee is commanded to report to the internal medical office for psychological evaluation. If they comply, the evaluation labels them as paranoid, unstable, or disgruntled. This information is placed in their file and is used later to justify the agencys action in the event of outside scrutiny.If the employee contacts a member of the news media, they are immediately cited with violating their secrecy agreement and criminal penalties are filed against them. Several news media outlets are connected to the CIA and NSA and notify them of the employees contact.Finally, the employee is forced to resign after being threatened with termination in kangaroo court meetings where the information fabricated in their files is used against them.After termination or forced resignation, interest rates on their internal credit union loans are raised to make the payments unaffordable. The release of the employees retirement funds needed provide for their family are blocked (a felony). The agency black lists them from gaining employment with other government agencies or contractors, further ruining them financially.Dehumanized, financially ruined and under severe emotional and mental pressure, the employees family begins to break apart. If the familys foundation is not strong, this results in alcoholism, depression and divorce. In some cases, it has resulted in the employee committing suicide, the ultimate goal of the program of destruction. This silences the employee permanently, obscuring the agencys role in their destruction. It is the perfect crime.Should the employee still have the resolve to endure this program of career and personal destruction and continues to press for release of the information, or if his family members attempt to sue the agency for the illegal activity, classified agencies will invoke the secretive State Secrets Privilege, which orders the employee and his family not to reveal the information or face prison. If the familys case reaches federal court, the State Secrets Privilege is invoked and the case is shut down  and sealed. Federal judges rubber stamp the censoring of the case without reviewing the case facts.Now that the employees case, and in some cases their familys case, is shut down and under seal, citing national security, the process of silencing the employee is complete. Many are never heard from again, fearing prison if they talk to anyone, including an attorney.Using attractive awards of multi-million dollar contracts, the US government military industrial complex convinces private corporations that their employees must be cleared and sign secrecy agreements. This includes employees at all levels, from secretaries to CEOs. Once they have signed the secrecy agreement, they are bound to keep all information, including potentially illegal information, quiet, being threatened with the same penalties.To date, over five million Americans have been required to sign this secrecy agreement and now fall under the shadow of the State Secrets Privilege.Only a few federal employees have made it through this systematic process of destruction to reveal what they know about the illegal operation they observed. Sadly, some whistle blowers have died mysterious deaths or committed suicide.Employees in intelligence agencies are aware of penalties contained in the secrecy agreement and the huge risk in violating it, even to expose corruption. Most look the other way to protect their careers, retirements and families. Many have observed the outward signs of the system of personal and career destruction used on others and a culture of fear exists. But, they are not fully aware of all that is being done. The full scope of the system is only known at the higher levels of the organization and is hidden from employees, until its use is necessary.This is why we do not see whistle blowers coming out and reporting what they have seen. This system has been used and perfected for over fifty years. It is being used because it works.It works, unless the system is exposed, the whistle blower knows what is coming and prepares for it, and they are supported by private organizations and individuals dedicated to truth in government.This support is essential, not only to protect the whistle blower and their family, but also to defend our Constitutional form of government from tyranny.Kevin M.

I went to DSHS to see about help while i recovered and filled out all the applications and medical records releases. I got denied on everything. I will say that they took over healthcare after insurance limits were reached, which didn’t take long the 15 minute helicopter ride was over $29,000 alone. I have never used any public service before, I’m a veteran and I have always had a job since I was 13 years old.

NRA Admits It Deceived Public – Says President Obama Never Could Have Confiscated Guns (VIDEO),"Proud Shares 
The NRA’s magazine acknowledged that President Obama “really hasn’t had the opportunity to” confiscate firearms, undercutting years of fearmongering about the supposed existence of a “ massive Obama conspiracy ” to dismantle the Second Amendment and take guns away. 
The NRA’s admission that a president can’t confiscate guns because “Congress writes the laws, not the president” also demonstrates the implausibility of repeated recent claims from the NRA that link Hillary Clinton to gun confiscation. 
The admission was included in a June 9 article for NRA magazine America’s 1st Freedom which took issue with how Obama “rudely” responded to a question from a gun store owner at a recent town hall event. 
The article quoted Obama as telling the questioner, “I’m about to leave office. There have been more guns sold since I’ve been president than just about any time in U.S. history. There are enough guns for every man, woman and child in this country. And at no point have I ever proposed confiscating guns from responsible gun owners. So it is just not true.” 
Responding to Obama’s statement, the article acknowledged, “Now, [the gun store owner]could have interrupted the president to mention that Obama really hasn’t had the opportunity to do that. Congress writes the laws, not the president”: 
Rhude didn’t sit down after asking his question. Rather, he stood silently as President Obama didn’t even try to answer his question, but instead went off on a defensive tirade: “First of all, the notion that I or Hillary or Democrats or whoever you want to choose are hell-bent on taking away folks’ guns is just not true. And I don’t care how many times the NRA says it.” 
Obama then said, “I’m about to leave office. There have been more guns sold since I’ve been president than just about any time in U.S. history. There are enough guns for every man, woman and child in this country. And at no point have I ever proposed confiscating guns from responsible gun owners. So it is just not true.” 
Now, Rhude could have interrupted the president to mention that Obama really hasn’t had the opportunity to do that. Congress writes the laws, not the president. He could then have listed the many attacks on the right to bear arms — from Operation Fast and Furious to Operation Choke Point to Obama’s attempted ban on common ammunition for AR-15-type rifles to his using a “pen and phone” to push anti-gun executive actions. But Rhude respectfully stayed silent. 
Claims about gun confiscation and Obama have been the NRA’s bread and butter for the past eight years . More recently, the NRA has suggested that the election of Clinton could lead to gun confiscation for law-abiding Americans.

BRICS do not lack mortar: What detractors should know | Russia & India Report,"brics , geopolitics , cooperation BRICS leaders at the summit in Goa. Source:Kremlin.ru 
A lot of people want to see the BRICS fail. Western nations, in particular the United States and Britain, are prime suspects. However, there are plenty of unwitting commentators in the emerging world who are playing into the West’s hands. Each year, as the BRICS summit draws near, the cacophony from these haters grows louder. Questions about the viability and relevance of the BRICS are raised in the media. 
During the build-up to the Goa summit this year, the refrain was similar but with the background buzz that the India-China rift over Pakistan-backed terrorism would derail the summit. However, the predicted outcome of an implosion didn’t materialise and, on the contrary, with India and Russia inking the S-400 missile deal , Goa 2016 turned out to be a memorable event. 
Since many innocent readers may have been misinformed by the compromised commentators – who will certainly be back like a bounced cheque next year – here’s a ready reckoner on the BRICS group. So the next time you hear remarks that the BRICS are collapsing, don’t lose sleep over the issue. World needs BRICS 
Most of the global multilateral institutions that exist today are no longer relevant. The IMF and the World Bank, for instance, were founded during the closing years of World War II. In geopolitical time, that’s ancient history. Similarly, the G-7 appears to be on life support and the OECD (Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development) is no longer a leading organisation. 
Russia, China and India must play a leading role in greater Eurasia 
With the western economies perched on monetary and budgetary cliffs, the five BRICS members provide a stable alternate force that offsets the West’s decline. Both China and India continue to experience high economic growth and are on course to become mega economies that will completely dwarf the West in the coming decades. Beijing’s growth may have fallen under 7 per cent but that’s enough to add the equivalent of Holland’s national income to the Chinese GDP. 
Bottom line: without the BRICS, the world economy will experience 1929 all over again. BRICS slowdown, not a meltdown 
Uday Kotak, executive vice-president of Kotak Mahindra Bank, feels India should quit the BRICS coalition because of the slowdown in four of the five economies. His view has been echoed by several so-called experts. But curiously, have you ever heard any economist or banker say the OECD must disband because it has basket cases such as Greece or terror exporters such as Turkey? 
According to the US-based Centre on Global Interests , “You can look at the BRICS from the financial market's point of view, or from a geopolitical point of view. But whichever lens you view it through, what you see is the same: despite economic slowdowns and even economic hardship in some nations, these are far and away the most powerful countries outside of the developed core. Their economies have scale. Their decisions can move financial markets. They have intellectual capital and clout within their regions. And in terms of foreign policy, they are the counterweight to a unipolar world run largely by Washington and its friends in London and Brussels.” 
It adds: “In both of these regards – economics and foreign policy – the BRICS are alive and kicking. In fact, they are more relevant today than they were in November 2001, when Jim O'Neill grouped them into the strange bedfellows that they have become.” Bilaterals can’t bring down the BRICS 
If the UN fails to discuss relevant political issues, the international body is considered a failure. But BRICS is not a platform that was created for discussing politics. The primary role of the five-member group is to remove the West’s grip from the levers that control the world economy. By establishing their own New Development Bank, the BRICS have ensured that the IMF is no longer the world’s lender-of-last-resort. 
In this backdrop, fears that bilateral issues involving India and China will wreck summits have consistently proved to be baseless. 
It’s time for BRICS to go on political overdrive 
Take Goa 2016. While the Goa Declaration mentions terror, the focus of the summit was not terrorism at all. Sure, Prime Minister Narendra Modi took a shot at Pakistan, describing it as the “mothership of terrorism”, and China defended its ally by saying it had made “great sacrifices”. But both New Delhi and Beijing were merely playing to their respective galleries even as the real summitry was happening behind closed doors. 
To be sure, politics can be tabled if it’s a side dish – like Syria was a couple of years ago – but issues with the potential to derail the summit simply have no place in BRICS. 
Critics of the BRICS often point to the India-China border issue as evidence of serious problems. But this misses the point. There always will be different opinions and views among the BRICS countries – just like there are differences among NATO or European Union members. BRICS are not united but it doesn’t matter 
Unlike NATO or the European Union, where the member countries have more or less the same goals and are also of the same racial stock, each of the BRICS countries is different. However, their membership of BRICS gives them a common goal – development. As emerging countries, they are focussed on raising their standards of living. 
The fact that they are united as a group, despite such stark differences in national goals, opinions and geopolitical rivalries and even outright hostilities, points to the viability of the BRICS. Facebook ",1

Experts predict a possible growth in the migration flow from China into Russia, by 2050 the Chinese may become the second largest population group in Russia, Scientific Director of the Center for Migration Research of the Institute of National Economic Prediction of Russia’s Academy of Science Zhanna Zayonchkovskaya said. 
""The number of unemployed people in China is more than the entire Russian population,"" she noted at an international conference at the North Caucasus Federal University in the Russian city of Stavropol, dubbed as ""Migration processes.""""If we maintain solid relations with China then I think by 2050 the Chinese may become the second largest population group in Russia and surpass the Central Asian populace as far as migration goes,"" the expert said. 
Zayonchkovskaya said the reason for this process was that after 2030 the migrant inflow from Central Asian countries would decline as a large part of young people had already left these countries to work or study in the neighboring states. 
Tajikistan and Uzbekistan are the main countries whose citizens come to Russia, Ukrainians migrate in large numbers, too. ""If we think of other countries from where migrant labor can be obtained, I can think of none other than China,"" Zayonchkovskaya noted, emphasizing that ""Russia will need foreign workers to ensure its economic development."" 
According to the expert, the changes in the pension legislation would not balance the situation given the decrease in the working-age population. ""Raising the retirement age will neither level out the demographic waves, nor will it solve the labor shortage problem, as it only solves the problem of the Pension Fund, though the demographic situation still remains problematic,"" Zayonchkovskaya added noting that according to the Federal Migration Service, the international migration flow into Russia in 2015 had amounted in 9.8 mln people.

Quand l’art s’invite dans les usines de l’Oural,"Dictionnaire visuel Quand l’art s’invite dans les usines de l’Oural Depuis des temps reculés, l'Oural est synonyme d'industrie lourde : il fut un temps où la région était même la plus industrialisée au monde. Mais les temps changent, et cette région russe montagneuse est aujourd'hui plus célèbre pour ses projets artistiques. Nouvelles galeries, street art, Biennale d'Art de la Jeunesse… Les artistes émergents fourmillent, sans oublier les racines industrielles de la région. Faites défiler vers le bas pour voir plus Denis Tarasov Guennadi Vlassov est né en 1943 à Sverdlovsk (aujourd'hui Ekaterinebourg). Il est diplômé de l'école de commerce Ouralmach en 1961. OuralMach était un géant de la construction de machines, véritable étendard de l'industrie soviétique. Denis Tarasov Vlassov a travaillé comme artiste d'usine à partir de la fin des années 1960 jusqu'au début des années 1990. Il concevait des journaux muraux, écrivait des slogans et peignait des affiches satiriques. Denis Tarasov A la fin des années 1980, il aménage l'intérieur de la salle des outils de l'un des ateliers avec des répliques de célèbres paysages peints par des artistes russes et quelques unes de ses propres créations. Denis Tarasov Parmi les travaux connus, il a notamment copié la Fille à l'attelage en train de faucher par Arkadi Plastov, qui peignait des scènes de la vie quotidienne dans le style du réalisme socialiste. Denis Tarasov Dans les années 1980, les travailleurs eux-mêmes ont commencé à choisir des thèmes pour leurs armoires à outils – la plupart étaient des représentations de la nature. Au crépuscule de l'industrialisation, l'art était considéré comme un moyen de s'évader de la grisaille de l'usine. Denis Tarasov A l'heure de la modernisation, les peintures sont comme une bouffée d'air frais dans le royaume endormi des immenses machines condamnées au silence. Denis Tarasov Il y a quelques années, quelques uns de ces travaux ont fait leur apparition sur internet et ont retenu l'attention de plusieurs commissaires d'exposition d'Ekaterinebourg, qui ont présenté les conteneurs de Vlassov en tant que projet spécial lors de la Biennale d'art contemporain de la ville. Denis Tarasov Les conteneurs de Vlassov sont un exemple de la façon dont des objets de la vie de tous les jours se transforment en art contemporain une fois transposés dans une galerie. Denis Tarasov « Nous avons travaillé ici pendant des années et avons eu largement le temps de profiter de son art ! » , rigolent des travailleurs d'OuralMach en regardant passer des visiteurs de l'exposition. Denis Tarasov Le mot « exposition » est d'ailleurs un peu fourvoyé : malgré l'apparition de commissaires, de critiques d'art et de journalistes dans l'atelier, rien n'a vraiment changé à l'usine.

Das Solowki-Archipel: Wo das Paradies auf die Hölle trifft,"26. Oktober 2016 Julia Shevelkina Russia Beyond The Headlines organisierte auf der Buchmesse eine Filmvorführung und eine Lesung zu den Solowezki-Inseln. Quelle:RBTH Hölle und Paradies liegen auf dem Solowki-Archipel nah beieinander, wie der russische Schriftsteller Ewgenij Wodolazkin auf der Frankfurter Buchmesse erklärte. Dort stellte er nicht nur sein neues Buch vor, sondern auch die RBTH-Kurzfilmdokumentation „Das Gedächtnis der Solowezki-Inseln“. 
„Viele leben gerne hier auf dem Solowki-Archipel. Der Sommer ist warm genug und der Winter ist kalt. Pilze und Beeren sprießen aus der Erde, Fische locken Angelfreunde und die Natur! Vor allem sie ist hier einfach atemberaubend.“ Ein schöner Ort eigentlich, wenn es nicht um die berühmt-berüchtigten Inseln im Weißen Meer ginge, wo sich zu Sowjetzeiten das erste große Häftlingslager befand, und nicht ein Mann spräche, der täglich Touristen hierhin bringt, um sie an die grausame Geschichte des Ortes zu erinnern. Der lange Weg auf die Solowezki-Inseln „Das Gedächtnis der Solowezki-Inseln“ heißt die Kurzfilmdokumentation , die das RBTH-Team vor einem Jahr drehte. Mit Foto- und Kameraequipment im Gepäck begaben sich junge Reporter damals auf eine lange Reise, sprachen mit Mönchen aus dem Solowezki-Kloster, fanden Gärtner, für die das Archipel ein gewöhnlicher Arbeitsort wie jeder andere ist, und besuchten das Fischerdorf Rebalda, wo seit Jahrzehnten Meerkohl gewonnen wird.
Der so entstandene Film wurde am vergangenen Samstag am russischen Stand der Frankfurter Buchmesse präsentiert. Die Einführung gab der russische Schriftsteller Evgenij Vodolazkin, der seinen neuen Roman „Aviator“ („Der Flieger“) vorstellte. In seinem Buch, das die vielschichtige Geschichte der Inseln thematisiert, lässt sich ein Häftling des Gulags 1932 im Rahmen eines Experiments einfrieren und überlebt so das Aufblühen und den Niedergang der Sowjetmacht. 1999 wird er entfrostet und fängt an, ein Tagebuch zu führen, in dem seine Erinnerungen an die Vergangenheit sich mit aktuellen Ereignissen verflechten.

„ Die Solowezki-Inseln spielen eine große Rolle in meinem Roman“, erzählte Vodolazkin dem anwesenden Publikum, „sie sind in gewisser Hinsicht stellvertretend für Russland zu betrachten.“ Einst habe es hier ein Klosterparadies gegeben, das später in die kommunistische Lagerhölle umgewandelt worden sei. „Zumindest dachte ich so, als ich vor fünf Jahren meine Arbeit an einem anderen Buch – den Erinnerungen der Menschen, die auf den Solowezki-Inseln einsaßen – begann. Aber dann stellte sich alles als wesentlich schwieriger heraus“, berichtete Vodolazkin. 
Denn das Paradies in Reinform habe es auf Solowki nie gegeben. Schon 1667 bis 1676 sei der Archipel Schauplatz einer schrecklichen Periode der russischen Geschichte gewesen, als die Inseln von zaristischen Truppen besetzt waren. Diese Zeit nennt Vodolazkin eine schlimme Form der Barbarei. 
„Und auch die Hölle war hier nie die Hölle in Reinform“, fügte der Autor hinzu. Sogar im Straflager habe es Beispiele für menschliche Größe gegeben. „Wenn Mönche, die dort lebten, Wärtern das Leben retteten, halfen sie damit eigentlich denjenigen, die ihnen Leid angetan haben“, erklärte Vodolazkin.

Mit diesem einfachen Beispiel zeigte Vodolazkin, wie widersprüchlich die Geschichte der Solowezki-Inseln doch war, und tauchte mit dem Publikum ein in die Welt des Dokumentarfilms. An das Heilige des Ortes erinnert der Film mit Aufnahmen der hölzernen Kreuze und Kapellen. Die kleinen eisernen Grabsteine mit der lakonischen Inschrift „Zwei Personen“ bringen den Zuschauer jedoch schnell in die Gegenwart der Solschenizyn-Bücher zurück. „Die Inseln erinnern sich an alles, was hier passiert ist. Das spürt man“, sagt eine Offstimme am Ende des Films.",1
Schlacht um Mossul: Steht ein zweites Aleppo bevor?,"syrien , irak , isis In Mossul verbleiben viele Zivilisten. Quelle:AFP / East News 
Der irakische Ministerpräsident Haider al-Abadi hat am 17. Oktober den Beginn der Rückeroberung Mossuls verkündet. Die Großstadt im Norden des Irak ist seit Juni 2014 in den Händen des IS. Je nach Schätzung befinden sich derzeit bis zu 1,5 Millionen Zivilisten und 10 000 IS-Kämpfer in der Stadt. Bis zu 60 000 Mann zogen in den Kampf, um Mossul zu befreien: Kräfte der irakischen Armee, sunnitische und schiitische Einheiten und kurdische Peschmerga-Kämpfer. Die internationale Anti-Terror-Koalition unter US-Führung sorgt für Luftunterstützung. 
„Der Augenblick des großen Sieges ist nah“, erklärte al-Abadi zu Beginn der Offensive. Mehr als eine Woche nach der Verkündung wird jedoch deutlich, dass der Vormarsch der Anti-IS-Kräfte ins Stocken gerät. Gleich nach Beginn der Befreiungsoperation kam es zu Verwerfungen zwischen Bagdad und Ankara. Derweil geht der IS in bereits befreiten Siedlungen zu Gegenoffensiven über. Der republikanische Präsidentschaftskandidat Donald Trump wertete die Operation bereits als ein „totales Desaster“. Wer wird kämpfen? Kampf gegen IS: Russland liefert Waffen an irakische Kurden Der Militärexperte Wladimir Jewsejew, stellvertretender Direktor des Instituts der GUS-Länder, betont, dass die Zahl aufgestellter Truppen an sich nicht aussagekräftig sei: „Die Kurden haben gar nicht vor, Mossul zu befreien“, sagt er. „Sie haben kurdische Gebiete im Stadtumland eingenommen und gehen keinen Schritt weiter. Die Schiiten wird al-Abadi nicht nach Mossul lassen, um Massaker zu verhindern. Und die Türken – die schlagkräftigste Einheit von allen – werden die Stadt nicht stürmen, um eigene Opfer zu vermeiden“, erklärt der Experte. Es bleibe also nur die irakische Regierungsarmee. Dort blühe aber die Korruption und die Zahl der Deserteure sei hoch. „Von den angekündigten 60 000 Mann werden für die Eroberung Mossuls höchstens 30 000 bereitstehen“, sagt Jewsejew. „In einer vom IS stark befestigten urbanen Umgebung reichen diese Kräfte nicht aus.“ Zumal Mossul in westlicher Richtung offen sei, weswegen die IS-Kämpfer ständigen Nachschub bekommen könnten. „Bis zu den US-Präsidentschaftswahlen am 8. November ist die Stadt, anders als die USA es geplant haben, sicherlich nicht einzunehmen.“
Der Nahost-Experte und Politologe Leonid Issajew von der Higher School of Economics ist ebenfalls der Ansicht, dass ein langanhaltender Kampf bevorstehe. „Erst wird man um die Provinz, dann um die Stadt Mossul und dann um jeden einzelnen Stadtteil kämpfen müssen“, sagt er. Die Schlacht werde sich über Monate hinziehen und viele Opfer fordern. Sunniten gegen Schiiten Syrien-Frieden in der Krise: Wie geht es nun weiter? Doch auch wenn der IS in Mossul bezwungen werden sollte, werde das den Irak nicht befrieden, so die Experten. Mit großer Wahrscheinlichkeit würde vor Ort ein neuer – konfessioneller oder ethnischer – Konflikt ausbrechen. Die schiitischen Einheiten hätten in den letzten zwei Jahren die sunnitische Bevölkerung nach der Befreiung vom IS massakriert – wegen der Kooperation mit dem Feind. Die Kurden verfolgten ihre eigenen Interessen: Sie expandierten territorial, wenn sie irakische Städte und Dörfer befreiten. Die arabische Bevölkerung werde verdrängt und kurdische Siedler nähmen ihren Platz ein.
Wie die Nachkriegsordnung in Mossul aussehen könnte, ohne dass es zu ethnischen und religiösen Säuberungen kommt, sei eine nicht weniger wichtige Frage als der Kampf gegen den IS. Wenn viele Religions- und Stammesgruppen nicht der Regierung in Bagdad unterstünden, sei eine solche Ordnung nicht ohne weiteres zu erreichen. Angst vor irakischem Aleppo Machtspielchen auf höchster Ebene: Der Syrien-Konflikt im UN-Sicherheitsrat Ein weiteres Problem: In Mossul verbleiben viele Zivilisten. Seit Beginn der Offensive wurden infolge von Luftschlägen der Koalition bereits Todesopfer unter der Zivilbevölkerung gemeldet.
Jewsejew betont, dass zivile Opfer beim Bombardement von Städten praktisch nicht zu vermeiden seien. Washington verstehe das und versuche eine ähnliche Situation wie in Aleppo zu vermeiden. Dort beschuldigt der Westen Russland und Syrien, Luftschläge gegen die Zivilbevölkerung zu fliegen. 
„Die Amerikaner erklären bereits, sie wollten nicht, dass sich Mossul in ein zweites Aleppo verwandele. Deshalb werden sie die Luftschläge auf ein Minimum zurückschrauben“, sagt Issajew. Zugleich stünden die Vereinigten Staaten vor einem Dilemma: „Das Bombardement führt zu mehr Toten unter den Zivilisten. Bleiben die Luftschläge aber aus, erleiden jene Kräfte Verluste, die die Stadt am Boden stürmen: Washingtons irakische Verbündete. Das erschwere die Einnahme Mossuls und die Koordination der Bodentruppen, so der Experte. RBTH-Check 37 bis 38 Millionen Menschen leben derzeit im Irak. Der Großteil – 75 bis 80 Prozent – sind Araber. Die Kurden sind mit 15 bis 20 Prozent die größte ethnische Minderheit. Sie leben in der Region Irakisches Kurdistan im Norden des Iraks, die seit Kriegsausbruch de facto von Bagdad unabhängig ist. Die Schiiten sind die größte Religionsgemeinschaft des Iraks – sie machen 60 bis 70 Prozent der Bevölkerung aus. Die Sunniten sind eine große Minderheit – 30 bis 40 Prozent. Der Islamische Staat bekennt sich zum sunnitischen Islam und betrachtet Schiiten als Häretiker. Der Norden des Iraks, insbesondere Mossul, wird überwiegend von Sunniten bewohnt.

Sieben Sprachen in nur vier Jahren: Ist Bella ein Wunderkind?,"Окт 5 2016 в 5:26 PDT 

Mit zwei Jahren konnte Bella kurze Sätze bilden und in drei Sprachen schnell lesen. Kurz vor ihrem dritten Geburtstag fügten ihre Eltern Chinesisch zum Ausbildungsprogramm hinzu. Laut Julia zeigte ihre Tochter ein großes Interesse an der neuen Sprache und wollte selbst Cartoons auf Chinesisch schauen. 
Mit drei Jahren und zwei Monaten lernte Bella mit Begeisterung Spanisch und Deutsch, aber nicht nur: Nebenbei tanzte sie, spielte Geige und sang. Später kam noch die arabische Sprache hinzu. Damals wie heute geht Bella spazieren, spielt Verstecken und liest normale Kinderbücher –in verschiedenen Sprachen. Grundsätzlich haben Spiele einen wichtigen Platz in ihrem Lernprozess. 
Die kleine Bella verbringt ihre Zeit mit Reisen mit Muttersprachlern, besucht eine englischsprachige Theatergruppe, hat Malunterricht auf Französisch, Tanzunterricht auf Spanisch und lernt Eiskunstlauf mit einem deutschen Muttersprachler. Außerdem organisieren ihre Eltern für sie Sprachunterricht mit ihren Freunden, die genauso mehrsprachig aufwachsen. Sprachen lernen ist gut für das Gehirn Авг 25 2016 в 10:32 PDT 

Wissenschaftler fanden heraus, dass die Fähigkeit, verschiedene Sprachen zu sprechen und zwischen ihnen zu wechseln, von unterschiedlichen Gehirnarealen abhängt. Sie werden je nach phonetischen Sprachmerkmalen, der Grammatik, Vorstellungen und sogar der Tonalität der Aussprache aktiv. 
„Jede neue Erfahrung führt dazu, dass unser Gehirn neue Nervenverbindungen herstellt”, erklärt Psychologin Tatjana Djatschenko. „Der für unser Gedächtnis zuständige Hippocampus stimuliert das Wachstum von neuen Neuronen. Dadurch wachsen wortwörtlich einige Gehirnareale.“ 
„Die Mehrsprachigkeit wirkt sich positiv auf die allgemeine Entwicklung des Kindes aus, obwohl es manchmal Sprachentwicklungsstörungen im frühen Alter verursachen kann. Dies tritt bei Kindern, die einsprachig aufwachsen, seltener auf”, sagt Kira Iwanowa, Mitarbeiterin des Instituts für linguistische Studien der Russischen Akademie der Wissenschaften. 
Sprachunterricht im frühen Alter sei jedoch keine Garantie dafür, dass ein Kind diese Sprache später gut beherrschen werde, erklärt Maria Molina, wissenschaftliche Mitarbeiterin des Instituts für Sprachwissenschaften der Russischen Akademie der Wissenschaften. “Ich kenne ein Beispiel: Eine Mutter hat mit ihrem Sohn nur Englisch gesprochen, bis er drei Jahre alt wurde. Dieser Junge kann derzeit nicht einmal sein Pensum in einer ganz normalen Schule schaffen.”",1

India has decided to add some more strength in its Russian made military helicopters Mi-17V5. 
“Ministry of Defence intends to procure and install approximately 200 sets of Electronic Warfare Suite comprising Radar Warning Receiver (RWR), Missile Approach Warning System (MAWS) and Counter Measure Dispensing System (CMDS) on Mi-17V5 helicopters,” reads a request for information issued by the Indian government. 
The system will provide self-protection to the helicopter against radar controlled weapons and IR seeking missiles by employing different counter measures such as chaffs, flares and directed infra-red. The Missile Approach Warning System (MAWS) is intended to provide the capability of detecting, identifying warning and prioritizing air to air and ground to air threat missiles to the pilot. Fifteen Mi-17V5 helicopters would also be integrated with Laser Warning Receiver (LWR) and Directed Infrared Counter Measures.

India also wants to secure its helicopters against radar controlled weapons and IR seeking missiles. For this Bharat Dynamics Limited (BDL) has design and developed the Counter Measure Dispensing System that will be integrated on to the platform. 
India plans to buy additional helicopters from Russia out of which more than a dozen will be made available to the BSF. India had already approved the purchase of 48 more Mi-17V-5 medium lift helicopters. Delivery of 151 Mi-17V-5 helicopters was made in February this year.

Russian grannies make deal with Lipton,"1 / 4 
Russian startup Cocco Bello, based in the village of Maliy Turish in the Sverdlovsk Region (760 miles from Moscow), will produce 15,000 candy spoons that will be included in large packages of Lipton Yellow Label tea in November. 
The deal came out of Cocco Bello’s participation in the Lipton Goodstarter project, a platform created to support young socially beneficial companies. As part of the initiative, Cocco Bello received a 300,000 rubles ($4,800) investment from Lipton. 
""Since we have won the Lipton contest, we decided to offer them the cooperation,"" said Guzel Sanzhapova, 28, the startup’s founder. Sanzhapova began the project as a family operation in 2013. “Today we have nine employees and most of them are seniors,” Sanzhapova said. The company’s main products are honey, herbal tea and candies. 
Sanzhapova is now making plans to build her own candy factory and hopes to attract investment through crowdfunding. She estimates the total cost of construction at about 6 million rubles ($95,500). She has already collected 938,000 rubles ($15,000). 
Lipton’s press service told RBTH that the Lipton program helps identify companies that have missions that fit well with the Lipton brand. According to the press service, a joint product between Lipton and Cocco Bello will go on sale as soon as official partner contract negotiations are concluded. “This is high speed for Unilever,” the press service said.

Filmmaker Maria Ivanova: People in Damascus ‘have fear in their eyes’,"movies , syria , RBTH Daily , refugees Russian filmmaker Maria Ivanova. Source: Elena Kern / press-photo 
Where did you find the courage to go to the Middle East to make a film on migrants? 
Maria Ivanova: I began making my film in Berlin, in a camp for refugees. I was searching for a female protagonist. But when I arrived, I was told that girls do not flee Syria alone, only with their husbands or relatives. 
In the end I visually began ""capturing"" interesting faces. I found my protagonist – 14-year-old Muhammad, who was sent by his parents to Germany alone. He did the whole journey alone so that later he could get his relatives out of Syria through the legal process of family reunification. 
During the shooting I understood that next I needed to go to Damascus, where this boy's parents remained. Due to the hassle in obtaining a Syrian visa my cameraman and I traveled to Syria through Beirut. In Lebanon you don't need a visa. Russian journalist in Syria: We came within a whisker of death 
As we were driving along the road I knew that ISIS was only 10 kilometers [6 miles] away, very near. We were driving incredibly fast, 200 kilometers per hour, and when the driver saw a motorcycle coming, the car quickly turned around and headed in the opposite direction. “Why?” I asked later. Because terrorists often drive around at night on motorcycles. 
That’s how we got to Damascus. There was no heating in the apartment we were taken to. No electricity and hot water. We slept on something similar to a couch. There are no real beds in the real East. And at three in the morning I heard bombing. 
Is all of Damascus in this state? 
M.I.: I was in the south and there it was frightening to walk out on the street. People have fear in their eyes, the atmosphere is very heavy. 
In the end did you meet the parents of your protagonist Muhammad? How did you contact them? 
M.I.: They welcomed us with open arms. They fed us. They have all means of communication, they use social networks. After meeting with them we returned to Beirut and went to the refugee camps in Lebanon's mountains, filming there for two weeks. 
Were the Lebanese camps different from the German ones? 
M.I.: Of course. Lebanon doesn’t have special conditions. There’s a character in our film, a man who has 17 children. He lives in a tent that he has divided into several parts. He patches up the holes. They all sleep on the floor. Despite their horrible position, these people offered us food and played the oud for us [an Arabian musical instrument – RBTH]. They joked… Their life is based on the hope that they will return home. Of course, many want to go to Europe. They fill out applications. But Europe does not accept everyone. 
In general, Lebanon is an unusual country. Just think, there are 18 religious confessions on a territory that is smaller than the Moscow Region. There are four million residents and one and a half million Syrian refugees. And yet, I never saw a conflict between, say, Christians and Muslims. They all go to the same restaurants, the same movie theaters, everyone is friendly. 
Which films are you taking to the festival in Lebanon? 
M.I.: We finished this documentary film just a few days ago and I decided to hold the premiere in Lebanon, where we shot most of the material. Moreover, our partner, the TV channel RT, is producing two documentary films: Women against ISIS and Sector of Contradiction . The directors of these films are coming to answer questions and hold master classes. 
How much is Russian culture present in Lebanon? Do people speak Russian there? 
M.I.: Many Lebanese studied in the Soviet Union. There is even an association of Soviet university graduates. These people speak Russian, many even married Russian citizens. Furthermore, there are 30,000 Russians living there. There are Lebanese who attend classes and study Russian. Sure, you mostly hear Arabic, English, French. Russian culture is not well known. So we sort of filled a vacuum. 
Is the war in the neighboring country felt in Lebanon? 
M.I.: You still feel the previous war, the civil war. There are buildings scarred by bombings. There are many military personnel, roadblocks, armored personnel carriers, patrols. But next to a destroyed building you can find a modern art gallery, which is followed by soldiers again, and then a modern theater. This is a patchwork country, it is very heterogeneous. Can a low-budget Russian disaster film look like a Hollywood blockbuster? 
Once I was at the Sarajevo Film Festival, which had a really heavy atmosphere. There were no stadiums there. They had turned into cemeteries since there was no space for burying people. While in Lebanon you feel very light. You want to live, despite certain moments… The presence of soldiers, on the contrary, creates the feeling of security. 
I traveled there by car with a driver, saw beautiful cities, mountains, wine production. I went to an apple festival. I wasn’t afraid. The country has a modern airport, taxis, hotels, wonderful restaurants, beaches and movie theaters. But the thing is that no one anywhere will give you 100-percent guaranteed security, including when you're driving through France or Germany. In terms of security, Lebanon is no different than Europe.

""That is a very significant leap and a very positive sign for us. It shows that the efforts we made in many fields, in particular in corporate management were not in vain,"" he said. 
Earlier this week it was reported that Russia moved up to the 40th position in the Doing Business-2017 rating, which is annually prepared by the World Bank. 
In 2012, Russia ranked 124th in that rating. 
In his May decrees issued in 2012 President Vladimir Putin set the task for the country to reach the 20th position in the rating of the World Bank by 2018. 
In 2016, Russia was on the 51st place in the Doing Business rating. 
However the methods of calculation of the World Bank’s rating changed earlier this year. Taking into account these changes Russia could have been on the 36th place already in 2015.",1

The Ropsha Palace, an 18th-century residence near St. Petersburg built by order of Peter the Great, is to be rented to the state-owned Rosneft oil corporation for 99 years. 
Making the announcement on Oct. 25, Russian Culture Minister Vladimir Medinsky said that the company will restore the palace, which is in a state of disrepair, and will create access for tourists to the estate after restoration. What is the palace famous for? 
The Ropsha palace and park ensemble is an 18th-century architectural monument and a former residence of the Romanov imperial family. The estate was built by decree of Peter the Great and was intended to resemble Carlsbad (Karlovy Vary, Czech Republic). Later, during Empress Elizabeth's reign, Italian architect Bartolomeo Rastrelli designed a new two-story palace on the site. A large-scale park was cultivated around it. 
After Catherine II (the Great) usurped her husband Emperor Peter III, she sent him to Ropsha where he died in mysterious circumstances.

Following the October Revolution the palace was nationalized, and in 1944 it was burned by the retreating German troops. After the war the estate was restored and it was used for military purposes: First the summer unit was stationed there, then the chemical protection battalion from the Leningrad Military District. 
In various periods a fish hatchery was located at Ropsha, as well as a cattle-breeding farm, a poultry farm and other agricultural structures. 
In the 1960s the palace was placed under state protection and at the end of the 1970s it was mothballed. How much will it cost to restore the ruins? 
Despite the fact that since 1990 the Ropsha palace and park ensemble has been on the UNESCO World Heritage list and is a monument of federal significance, most of the buildings on the estate are in ruins.

The palace was severely damaged by several fires in the late 1980s and early 1990s. And in 2015 five columns in the palace's portico collapsed. Afterwards, the Russian Culture Ministry allotted 15 million rubles ($241,000) for urgent work to save the monument. 
St. Petersburg officials say that many monuments in Ropsha are heavily damaged and some, such as bridges and hydraulic structures, are completely destroyed. This means the overall cost of the restoration may exceed five billion rubles ($80 million). Why is the state looking for investors to restore the monuments? 
Since the high costs and great difficulties in restoring cultural heritage objects do not always permit the state to carry out the work using budget resources, commercial enterprises and patrons are often invited to fund the restoration projects.

For example, VTB Bank and the Gatchina Alcohol Factory financed most of the restoration of the Gatchina Palace near St. Petersburg, although the monument remained a government property. 
The state can decide to auction or rent cultural heritage objects and dictate the conditions for their renovation. Privatization of local, regional and even federal monuments has existed since Jan. 1, 2008. 
There are more than 100 examples of privatized monuments with conditions for their restoration. For example, the recently opened New Holland complex in St. Petersburg was reconstructed with the help of Roman Abramovich's New Holland Development.",1
"“Man hat Angst, das Haus zu verlassen”","syrien Die Dokumentarfilmerin Maria Iwanowa hat in Syrien gedreht. Quelle:Elena Kern / Pressebild 
Was hat Sie dazu bewegt, in den Nahen Osten aufzubrechen, um dort einen Film über Flüchtlinge zu drehen? 
Die Dreharbeiten begannen in einem Flüchtlingslager in Berlin. Ich war auf der Suche nach einer Protagonistin. Man sagte mir aber, dass junge Frauen aus Syrien nicht alleine fliehen – entweder mit ihren Männern, oder mit Verwandten. 
Dann schaute ich mich einfach nach interessanten Gesichtern um. So fand ich meinen Protagonisten, den 14-jährigen Muhamed, der von seinen Eltern nach Deutschland geschickt worden war. Er hat den gesamten Weg alleine zurückgelegt, um später einen rechtlichen Anspruch auf Familiennachzug zu haben und seine Verwandten aus Syrien nachzuholen. 
Während der Dreharbeiten ist mir klar geworden, dass ich weiter nach Damaskus muss, wo Muhameds Eltern geblieben sind. Wegen Problemen mit dem Visum mussten mein Kameramann und ich über Beirut nach Syrien fliegen, weil der Libanon für Russen visumsfrei ist. „Angriff? Kaffeepause!“: Was russische Reporter in Syrien erlebt haben Als wir auf einer Schnellstraße unterwegs waren, da wusste ich: Zehn Kilometer von uns entfernt ist der IS, ganz nah. Wir fuhren 200 Kilometer in der Stunde und als unser Fahrer ein Motorrad sah, drehte er abrupt um und fuhr in die Gegenrichtung. Ich fragte nachher, warum er das gemacht habe. Er sagte, dass die Terroristen öfter mit Motorrädern unterwegs seien. 
So kamen wir nach Damaskus. Die Heizung in unserer Wohnung funktionierte nicht. Es gab keinen Strom und kein heißes Wasser, wir schliefen auf einer Art Sofa – im Nahen Osten hat man keine richtigen Betten. Um drei Uhr morgens hörte ich Bombenangriffe. 
Sieht es so in der gesamten Stadt aus? 
Ich war im Süden und da hat man Angst, sein Haus zu verlassen. Man kann die Angst in den Augen der Menschen sehen und die Atmosphäre ist sehr bedrückt. 
Haben sie die Eltern Muhameds letztendlich finden können? Konnten sie mit ihnen Kontakt aufnehmen? 
Sie empfingen uns sehr herzlich und luden uns zum Abendessen ein. Sie haben alles, um in Kontakt zu bleiben, sie nutzen soziale Netzwerke. Nach dem Treffen kehrten wir nach Beirut zurück, um von da aus in Flüchtlingslager in den Bergen zu fahren. Dort haben wir dann nochmal zwei Wochen lang gedreht. 
Gibt es Unterschiede zwischen den Flüchtlingslagern im Libanon und in Deutschland? Schlacht um Mossul: Steht ein zweites Aleppo bevor? Aber sicher. Im Libanon gibt es kaum Annehmlichkeiten. Im Film geht es unter anderem um einen Mann, der 17 Kinder hat. Er wohnt in einem Zelt, das er einfach in verschiedene Räume geteilt hat. Er flickt, wenn etwas kaputtgeht, sie schlafen auf dem Boden. Obwohl diese Menschen in schrecklichen Bedingungen leben, haben sie versucht, etwas für uns zu kochen. Sie haben Oud – ein orientalisches Musikinstrument – gespielt, haben Witze gemacht: Sie leben und hoffen, dass sie irgendwann nach Hause können. Alle denken nur daran. Viele wollen natürlich nach Europa und haben schon einen Antrag gestellt. Aber nicht jeder wird aufgenommen.
Der Libanon ist ein sehr interessantes Land. Stellen Sie sich das mal vor: Auf einem Gebiet, das kleiner als das Verwaltungsgebiet Moskau ist, leben 18 religiöse Bewegungen, vier Millionen Menschen und anderthalb Millionen Flüchtlinge zusammen. Ich habe trotzdem keine Konflikte gesehen, zum Beispiel zwischen Christen und Muslimen. Alle gehen in dieselben Restaurants und Kinos. Alles ist friedlich. 
Spürt man im Libanon etwas vom Krieg im Nachbarland? 
Man spürt den alten Krieg, also den Bürgerkrieg: Es gibt zum Teil zerbombte Gebäude, viel Militärpersonal, Kontrollposten. Manchmal sieht man Transportpanzer. Gleichzeitig sieht man aber auch eine Halle für moderne Kunst gleich neben den Soldaten, und ein Stück weiter ein modernes Kino. Es ist ein Patchwork-Land und sehr vielfältig. 
Ich bin mit dem Auto und einem Fahrer gereist und habe schöne Städte, Berge und eine Weinproduktion gesehen. Ich war auf einem Apfelfest. Angst hatte ich keine. Es gibt einen modernen Flughafen, Taxis, Hotels, sehr gute Restaurants, Strände und Kinos. Aber derzeit kann Ihnen niemand garantieren, dass Sie hundertprozentig sicher sind – das gilt übrigens auch für Frankreich oder Deutschland. Der Libanon unterscheidet sich in diesem Sinne nicht von Europa. RBTH-Check 
Der Film feierte am 24. Oktober im Rahmen des Russischen Filmfestivals “Fünf Jahre in fünf Tagen” in Beirut Premiere.

LinkedIn in Russland: Kommt die Sperre?,"internet , gesetze Die Aufsichtsbehörde Roskomnadsor möchte einen Präzedenzfall schaffen. Quelle:AFP/East News 
LinkedIn, das größte soziale Netzwerk für Geschäftskontakte und die Jobsuche, könnte in Russland gesperrt werden. Laut der nationalen Internet-Aufsichtsbehörde Roskomnadsor verstoße LinkedIn gegen das russische Gesetz, das Onlinedienste verpflichtet, Daten russischer Nutzer auf russischen Servern zu speichern. 
Die Forderung, die seit dem 1. September 2015, also mehr als einem Jahr, besteht, wird von einigen Unternehmen bislang nicht umgesetzt. Im Sommer verklagte Roskomnadsor LinkedIn. Das Gericht sah die Behörde im Recht und fügte LinkedIn dem Index in Russland verbotener Seiten hinzu. 
Das Urteil ist noch nicht rechtskräftig, und so ist das soziale Netzwerk weiterhin verfügbar. Das Unternehmen ging in Berufung, die am 10. November dieses Jahres abgeschlossen werden soll. Sollte es der LinkedIn Corporation nicht gelingen, das Verbot abzuwenden, wäre es der erste Fall, in dem ein großes Internetunternehmen in Russland gesperrt wird, weil es sich weigert, Daten russischer Nutzer in Russland zu speichern. Im August des Jahres 2016 schätzte TNS die russischen LinkedIn-Nutzer auf 2,6 Millionen. „Jedes Jahr ein Skandal!"" 
LinkedIn äußerte sich bislang nicht zu dem Fall. Roskomnadsor hingegen warnt alle Unternehmen, die in Russland aktiv sind, aber keinen Firmensitz im Land haben. Zu diesen gehört unter anderem auch Facebook. Datenspeicherungsgesetz: Aus für Google, Facebook und Co.? „Wir sind der tiefsten Überzeugung, dass jedes Unternehmen, auch ein ausländisches, das hier vielleicht keine Vertretung hat, aber durch unsere Bürger Geld verdient, ihre Daten verarbeitet und damit Marketing betreibt, unter dieses Gesetz fallen muss"", sagt Wadim Ampelonski, Vertreter der Behörde, im Gespräch mit RBTH.
LinkedIn hatte die Aufmerksamkeit Roskomnadsors auf sich gezogen, da es laut der Behörde seit 2010 jedes Jahr zu einem Skandal bezüglich der Datensicherheit von Millionen von Nutzern komme. 
Das russische Unternehmen DataLine, das Rechenzentren betreibt, lässt verlauten, dass man bislang keine gesteigerte Nachfrage nach Server-Racks in Russland beobachten könne. Es heißt, große ausländische Unternehmen informierten sich noch. Zu einer Verlagerung der Infrastruktur nach Russland sei es noch nicht gekommen. „Bis zum Präzedenzfall versuchen sie, nichts zu unternehmen“, so ein Vertreter von DataLine.

¿Qué es la Unión Económica Euroasiática?,"kazajistán , bielorrusia , armenia , kirguistán , economía , unión económica euroasiática Serzh Sargsyan, presidente de Armenia, Alexander Lukashenko, presidente de Bielorrusia, Vladimir Putin, presidente de Rusia Nursultan Nazarbayev, presidente de Kazajistán. Fuente:Reuters 
En un principio, tras la caída de la Unión Soviética en 1991, surgió una nueva unificación de las antiguas repúblicas soviéticas: la Comunidad de Estados Independientes (CEI). Sin embargo sus funciones fueron meramente representativas. En 2009 se hizo un intento por sustituirla por la Unión Aduanera, y en 2010 esta empezó comenzó con Rusia y Kazajistán. Al año siguiente se unió también Bielorrusia y los controles aduaneros entre los tres se eliminaron. Posteriormente, en 2015, Armenia y Kirguistán se sumaron a este grupo. La CEI, ¿qué es y para qué se creó esta organización tras el colapso de la URSS? 
“La UEE es necesaria para conservar y fortalecer los lazos económicos entre unos países que una vez formaron parte de la misma nación: la URSS, y que después de cuya caída se alejaron considerablemente unos de otros en el plano económico”, afirma Evgueni Guschin, investigador del Laboratorio Internacional de Investigaciones Económicas Internacionales de la Academia Presidencial Rusa de Economía Nacional y Administración Pública. 
El experto afirma que la UEE debe convertirse en un escenario para la integración de la economía de sus miembros en el sistema mundial. “Actualmente la tendencia es que en el mundo se forman varios grandes bloques comerciales de integración”, añade Guschin. Se podría afirmar que la UEE es más efectiva que la CEI, especialmente en lo que se refiere a la implementación de sus decisiones. 
Evgueni Guschin cree que son tres los motivos principales para el éxito de la UEE. Primero, los lazos históricos y culturales de los países de la URSS; al fin y al cabo, países que un día formaron parte de una misma nación lo tienen más fácil para integrarse. Segundo, la voluntad política de los miembros, que determina la dirección estratégica de la integración económica de Eurasia. Tercero, el órgano de administración: la Comisión Económica Euroasiática, cuyo funcionamiento altamente profesional facilita el diálogo y la resolución de conflictos entre los países de la Unión. Fundamentos del funcionamiento 
“Como asociación supranacional, la UEE supone una integración bastante más exhaustiva de los países miembro que la CEI, comparable en grado con la de la UE”, afirma el analista financiero de Finan, Timur Nigmatullin. La UEE permite que se reduzcan drásticamente los límites comerciales de diverso tipo entre los países y facilita el movimiento de capital y de mano de obra. 
De continuar como hasta ahora, el efecto multiplicador de la asociación a largo plazo aportará a Rusia hasta un 0,5% en PIB al año, y para los participantes de menor tamaño, hasta un 1%, según cálculos de Nigmatullin. 
“La UEE ha formado en gran medida un mercado común para los países que la conformaron”, explica Serguéi Jestanov, consejero de macroeconomía del director general de Otkrytie Bróker. Según el experto, el papel principal de esta organización es la eliminación de las barreras comerciales para la mayoría de los productos. 
Durante la primera etapa se realizó un trabajo de integración aduanera, comercial y de regulación. 
Los miembros de la asociación tenían una misión importante: elaborar de un marco jurídico único de las esferas principales de trabajo y crear las condiciones necesarias para la armonización de las legislaciones nacionales. 
En 2010 entró en vigor el Código de Aduanas y en Rusia, Bielorrusia y Kazajistán se puso en funcionamiento un sistema único de regulación. Se aprobaron documentos normativos de administración de aduanas, incluidas las normas generales de declaración de mercaderías. Gracias a ello, se redujo considerablemente la cantidad de documentos necesarios para el registro de declaraciones de mercancías y desapareció el control aduanero de las fronteras de los países participantes del acuerdo. 
Posteriormente, en 2012, surgió un órgano reglamentario único para la unión: la Comisión Euroasiática. En enero de ese año se adoptaron 17 acuerdos base internacionales que conformaban el Espacio Económico Euroasiático. Su formación supuso la garantía de las llamadas cuatro libertades: circulación de bienes, servicios, capital y fuerza de trabajo. 
La labor para fortalecer la integración entre los participantes del proyecto euroasiático económico, realizada durante la etapa de formación del Espacio Económico Euroasiático, permitió que las naciones prepararan las condiciones para la creación de la Unión Económica Euroasiática , la cual entró en funcionamiento a partir del 1 de enero de 2015. 
El nuevo contrato definía el marco jurídico de los servicios del mercado único. Se establecieron los principios generales de regulación técnica. Para octubre de 2016 la lista de reglamentos técnicos adoptados por la Unión Económica Euroasiática contaba ya con 36 documentos, 34 de los cuales ya han entrado en vigor. 
“La UEE ha conseguido crear la condiciones para fortalecer y desarrollar la cooperación comercial y económica entre los estados miembro”, señala Evgueni Guschin. Según el experto, prueba de ello es la estadística del volumen de comercio exterior de Rusia en 2015, que en condiciones de regresión general del volumen de exportación e importación, no se vio tan reducido dentro de la UEE como con respecto a otros países del mundo. 
En 2015 se unieron las repúblicas de Armenia y Kirguistán y Unión Económica Euroasiática ostenta el segundo puesto en lo que se refiere al nivel de integración de las asociaciones económicas, detrás de de la Unión Europea. ¿Una segunda Unión Europea? 
Según Evgueni Guschin, al comparar la UEE con la Unión Europea, es necesario tener en cuenta primeramente lo joven que es la primera. 
“La UE tiene a sus espaldas un largo recorrido sobre desarrollo de integración,que va desde la Comunidad Europea del Carbón y del Acero surgida tras la Segunda Guerra Mundial. De momento la UEE no puede presumir del nivel de integración alcanzado en esta Europa cohesionada”, comenta Guschin. Sin embargo, según afirma, la experiencia de la UE, tanto positiva como negativa, se ha tenido en cuenta al crear la UEE. 
“En general no se puede hablar de un proceso exitoso o fallido al hablar de un proyecto de tal envergadura internacional como es la UEE. En una primera unión se trazaron los intereses económicos y políticos concernientes a las esferas de influencia”, explica Alexander Yegórov, principal analista de TeleTrade. 
Según el experto, en comparación con la CEI, la Unión Económica Euroasiática es una organización más viable, pues en la base de la alianza yacen los intereses económicos de los participantes. 
“A diferencia de la CEI, la UEE no es, primeramente, una unión política sino económica. Sin una integración sólida con otros bloques económicos se desarrollará bastante despacio pues ya que, a excepción de Rusia, la economía de las demás naciones es excesivamente pequeña”, afirma Gueorgui Vaschenko, de la compañía inversora Freedom Finance. 
Este mismo mes comienzan las negociaciones sobre la creación de zonas de libre comercio entre la Unión Económica Euroasiática y China en un formato de “cinco más uno”. Sobre esa base se puede hablar de la formación de una colaboración euroasiática especial en el amplio sentido de la palabra.",1
Prowling Amur tiger nabbed near Vladivostok,"Prowling Amur tiger nabbed near Vladivostok October 27, 2016 TASS animals , russian far east , vladivostok The Amur tiger is on the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species. Source: Yuri Smityuk/TASS 
A full-grown Amur tiger has been caught near the Russian Far Eastern city of Vladivostok and sent for rehabilitation to a special center. The large feline predator is a male weighing 170 kilograms (roughly 375 pounds) that had killed a cow in the town of Artyom about 40 kilometers from Vladivostok, the Amur Tiger Center’s press service reported. 
""On the morning of Oct. 26, a resident of the Artyom town suburb reported to the police that a tiger had killed a cow… That same evening a response team from the hunting supervision agency spotted the tiger using an infrared camera. The predator was immediately caught and brought to the Tiger Rehabilitation and Reintroduction Center in the Alekseyevka settlement,"" the Amur Tiger Center said. 
The tiger will stay at the rehabilitation center while experts determine his future. He may be released into the wild in an area far from human settlements but inhabited with enough ungulates (or hoofed mammals). Ecologists had a similar experience last year, when a tiger named Uporny (or ‘Persistent’) who had been attacking dogs in the Khabarovsk region, was caught and later released into a distant area. Tiger cub found prowling the streets of Vladivostok 
Only a few days ago, another male tiger was caught 20 kilometers away from Vladivostok. The predator not only walked near the city but also entered the city territory. He, too, has been sent to the rehabilitation center. It is a young male tiger weighing 140 kilograms (roughly 308 pounds) who is likely to be released into the wild. 
Several weeks ago reports of a tiger were received from Vladivostok’s neighboring town of Artyom but the search ended without any success. 
The Amur tiger is on the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species. According to the last year’s data, at present only 480-540 members of this species live in the wild, with 90 percent of them inhabiting Russia’s Far Eastern Primorye and Khabarovsk regions.",1

Said Carmel Institute Founder and Advisory Chair Susan E. Carmel, “The Carmel Institute emphasizes shared values, common interests and cultural dialogue. These are important qualities necessary to achieve cooperation, mutual respect and to overcome pervasive stereotypes. I am honored and grateful to have two incredible cultural Ambassadors at our Fifth Anniversary celebration for the Carmel Institute. Igor Butman and Wynton Marsalis exemplify the best of cultural diplomacy and cultural dialogue, and help us represent the Institutes' focus on enhancing greater cultural understanding through shared common interests and face to face interactions. By continuing to emphasize the importance of these qualities to our younger generations and future leaders, we are making an investment into the future that will be paid back ten-fold over time.” 
Ambassador of the Russian Federation to the U.S. and Honorary Co-Chair of the Institute acknowledged the Institute’s milestone by saying, “We would like to congratulate the Carmel Institute for Russian Culture and History and its leadership with the fifth anniversary and express our gratitude for their support and dedication. What started as a modest cultural initiative, five years later has grown both in scope and scale. Far surpassing the initial plans, it has now turned into an Institute that creates an opportunity to strengthen interest and knowledge of culture and history of Russia, thus contributing to the increase of mutual understanding between the two nations.”

According to jazz great Igor Butman, “I am honored to contribute to the rich tradition of jazz diplomacy by performing with Wynton Marsalis at the fifth anniversary concert of the Carmel Institute of Russian Culture and History. It is an even greater honor to perform at the Lincoln Theater where so many giants of jazz have expressed themselves in the universal language of music. I wish the Carmel Institute many more years of success in its tireless campaign to promote culture as a medium of communication between two great cultures that have always achieved success through dialogue and cooperation.”

India to buy engines to install in Russian-made frigates,"india , frigate , indian navy Project 11356 Admiral Grigorovich frigate. Source:mil.ru 
India will independently acquire or build and install engines into the Russian-made Project 11356 frigates , India’s Defence Minister Manohar Parrikar has said. 
After the Russian-Indian annual Summit held in Goa on October 15, the two countries signed an intergovernmental agreement on the construction of the frigates. 
Russia’s Deputy Prime Minister Dmitry Rogozin had noted that two of these vessels would be built in Russia, and two in India. 
According to the Indian minister, negotiations on the purchase of the frigates by India had begun a long while earlier but, because of the crisis in relations with Russia, Ukraine had refused to supply gas-turbine power plants for the Russian ships. 
Russia, India will expand military cooperation with focus on Navy projects 
“Now we will buy these engines ourselves and install them in the ships. The frigate will be provided with Indian equipment. This version (of the frigate) has stealth technologies, and we will participate in the design work,” the minister was quoted as saying by the NDTV news channel. 
India already has six frigates of the Talwar type – the predecessors of Project 11356, designed for export. The Indian ships entered into service in 2003-2004 and in 2012-2013. 
The standard patrol ship of the Burevestnik type is armed with Kalibr cruise missiles. However, as Minister Rogozin stated in Goa, the new frigates will be equipped with BrahMos cruise missiles, of joint Russian-Indian production.

Average Moscow entrepreneur 'survives' only 5.7 years,"Entrepreneurship is growing faster in Moscow than in any other region of the country. Source:Reuters 
The average individual entrepreneur “survives” only 5.7 years, according to new research by the PwC consulting firm. 
The conclusions, based on data from the Federal Tax Service and the Levada Center from 2010 to 2016, were published in a new report, “The Development of Individual Entrepreneurship in Moscow,” the RBC website reports . 
Transforming the business potential of BRICS 
The researchers concluded that, since 2010, the number of registered individual entrepreneurs in Moscow has increased by 51 percent to 244 thousand. However, the entrepreneurs' businesses last, on average, less than 6 years. The main reasons for the closures are economic problems (51 percent) such as declining demand, increasing competition, and growing costs, and tax issues (10 percent). 
According to PwC, entrepreneurship is growing faster in Moscow than in any other region of the country. Muscovites now make up 7 percent of all individual entrepreneurs in Russia, 3 percent higher than in 2010. 
But growth has not been even. According to PwC, the main wave came in the 2010-2012 period, when the annual increase was 9-10 percent. Due to rising insurance rates, the number of individual entrepreneurs declined by 2 percent in 2013. The rate rebounded in 2014 and 2015 by 4 and 7 percentage points respectively. In the first half of 2016, it stood at 5 percent. 
However, it can be difficult to state with clarity what these rates mean in practice. Individual entrepreneurs may indeed be people starting small businesses, but they can also be individuals formally registered this way for tax benefits. 
New Russian app to manage small business 
PwC also concluded that 61 percent of individual entrepreneurs work in the service sector, 27 percent in retail, 8 percent in wholesale trade, and 4 percent in manufacturing. 
Outside Moscow, the growth dynamic of entrepreneurship has been less impressive. For nearly six years, PwC concluded, the national rate has been negative: -8 percent. 
The second fastest entrepreneurship growth rate was recorded in St. Petersburg (41 percent), followed by the Moscow Region (31 percent).

The world's largest professional network LinkedIn could soon be blocked in Russia. The company has failed to comply with a law that obliges companies to keep data on Russian users in the country. 
""We are seeking a court order to block LinkedIn. We twice sent requests in the summer, but they did not provide answers to our questions,"" said Roskomnadzor spokesman Vadim Ampelonskiy in an interview with the TASS news agency. Apart from not moving servers to Russia, LinkedIn collects and sends information about people who are not users of the network without their consent, according to the Russian internet watchdog Roskomnadzor. 
Yakutia is where Google should store data 
According to the spokesman, Moscow’s Tagansky District Court has ruled in favor of the watchdog, but LinkedIn has appealed to a higher court. 
“If the appellate court upholds the judgment, and it will no longer be appealed, the decision will enter into force within 30 days. We will include the appropriate IP address in the register of violators of the personal data rights, which means blocking,”Ampelonskiy said. The decision will be announced on November 10. 
The watchdog will remove the ban, if the social network provides information that it has fulfilled the law and moved servers with data about Russians to the country. 
""This is the first company we are suing in court. In future we will use the same mechanism in relation to other companies,""the spokesman said. 
Roskomnadzor also told Kommersant daily that another reason for the lawsuit was ""numerous publications in the media about repeated leaks of user data from the social network."" 
Big Brother is listening: Beware 
In May, website Haker.ru reported the sale of 167 million stolen LinkedIn accounts, and passwords for 117 million accounts on the dark web. LinkedIn said the leak happened in 2012, and passwords have now been updated. 
LinkedIn is the world's largest business and employment oriented social network. As of 2015, it had 400 million users with 5 million people registered in Russia.

Russia’s biggest IMAX film is ready for death or glory,"movies , culture , interview Director Alexei Mizgiryov at a news conference before the premiere of the film ""The Duelist"" in Moscow. Source:Ekaterina Chesnokova/RIA Novosti 
Even during the stage of production, Alexei Mizgirev’s The Duelist caught the attention of the international cinema industry. The world premiere of the movie was held the Toronto Film Festival and, in collaboration with IMAX, the film is being released in the U.S. and other countries. 
Before The Duelist, Mizgirev was considered to be only a “festival” director in Russia – all his previous pictures had gone out on limited release, and were seen by only a few thousand people. However, suddenly, in cooperation with producer Alexander Rodnyansky ( Jayne Mansfield’s Car , Cloud Atlas , Leviathan ), he has made one of the most expensive projects in the history of Russian cinema. 
Set in the 1860s, The Duelist is a costume drama about a killer, the officer Yakovlev, who engages in duels for other people. For some mystical reason bullets cannot kill him, so he always wins his duels. 
Before the film released, Mizgirev spoke to RIR about his new film. 
RIR: How does it feel, after directing only low-budget auteur films, to be a director of a film that cost such a large amount of money, going by standards of the Russian film industry? 
Alexei Mizgirev: People ask me this a lot. At first I was a bit lost and didn’t know how to answer, because I hadn’t really noticed a big difference. With The Duelist we had no problems, for example with decoration and costume, because we could shoot where we wanted and didn’t have to save on props. I was now rid of many problems that had cropped up in previous films, because the producers were able to solve them perfectly.

This was all very pleasant. However such changes indirectly affect the creative process. We were constantly discussing points to work on, but it was all very democratic, because we both understood that there are mass-produced, cookie-cutter films, and others that are single, unique pieces. The Duelist is a unique film, in which individuality and the author’s style is important – with the background of a great story and modern visual effects, of course. 
RIR: All your preceding films have been about acute social issues in modern Russian life. And here we have balls, costumes, duels, and nobles in waistcoats. Where has this interest in this period come from? 
A.M.: Any director wants millions of people to watch his films. But when you’re given a budget of $1-2 million, it’s difficult to create beautiful and spectacular cinema . You would like to, but it’s impossible for objective reasons. Therefore, an interest in contemporary affairs is in some respects necessary, simply because you don’t have to waste money on expensive decorations and computer effects. 
The concept of The Duelist has already been in the works for several years, it was just lying somewhere, literally two paragraphs long. And then something happened, and I thought to myself, this needs to happen now. Even though realizing this idea was very far off, I already thought then that the biggest problem I’d have with it would not be to do with finance. 
RIR: What sort of difficulties are you talking about? 
A.M.: I am talking about the 19 th century itself, or rather, its image, which is difficult to portray in audiovisual art. You probably won’t disagree that Russian viewers only know about the 19 th century from TV series, since the last proper film made for the big screen was [Vladimir Motyl’s] The Captivating Star of Happiness , shot in 1975. But even this film was riddled with a mass of clichés and openly mistaken information about the 19 th century. 
A common film market for Russia, India and China? 
When I was preparing for The Duelist I sifted through a mass of sources on this period. It turns out that we don’t really know anything about them, what they really ate, drank, talked about, and how they really dressed, apart from some pleasant misconceptions we have. The 19 th century for the contemporary viewer is a load of old mothballs at granny’s place or some sedate play from a provincial theatre. 
I’d like to get rid of this stereotype and show this period like no one else has done – bright, harsh, echoing with our times. This is of course a grandiose task, but I’m not afraid of the work, or the public reaction to this new style of discussion about the past. This is a complete breaking of the mould. 
RIR: However the visual style of The Duelist has several times been compared to Sherlock Holmes by Guy Ritchie and the film Vidoqc by Pitof. Do you like having such parallels with your work? 
A.M.: Such comparisons have a lot of truth in them. However this is a very decorative work, a celebration of the genre in its purest form. The Duelist is a little different, including if we talk about its visual effects. 
RIR: With The Duelist , everyone asks you about the idea of honour, which is the main trigger for the film. You answer, expectedly, that honour is a timeless thing, and for this reason a story about this will always resound with the present. But it seems in your film fatalism plays just as important a role, one which is peculiar to the film’s characters. We’re guessing that this emphasis on the doomed characters’ relationship with fate is not an accidental one? 
A.M.: Yes, this is one of the driving forces of the film. Delving into stories about duels, I stumbled across an eloquent fact. In the 19 th century, in the birthplace of duels, France, they practically disappeared, like in many other countries. This is linked to the spread of firearms, which were far more dangerous than swords and which greatly levelled the playing field. 
For exactly this reason, duels flourished in Russia, I think for the most part thanks to fatalism, which to this day remains as one of the principle characteristics of the Russian mentality. Sink or swim – it is very much our thing, even if we are talking about life and death. The Duelist is precisely about this. Facebook",1
Central Bank: Russia’s moving up in Doing Business rating as good sign,"business , russia , ranking 
The Central Bank sees Russia’s moving up in the Doing Business rating as a good sign, Deputy CEO of the Central Bank Vladimir Chistyukhin told reporters. 
""That is a very significant leap and a very positive sign for us. It shows that the efforts we made in many fields, in particular in corporate management were not in vain,"" he said. 
Earlier this week it was reported that Russia moved up to the 40th position in the Doing Business-2017 rating, which is annually prepared by the World Bank. 
In 2012, Russia ranked 124th in that rating. 
In his May decrees issued in 2012 President Vladimir Putin set the task for the country to reach the 20th position in the rating of the World Bank by 2018. 
In 2016, Russia was on the 51st place in the Doing Business rating. 
However the methods of calculation of the World Bank’s rating changed earlier this year. Taking into account these changes Russia could have been on the 36th place already in 2015.

No need to worry about Russia-India relations: Trubnikov,"india , russia , indo-russian cooperation Russian President Vladimir Putin and Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, right, during their meeting at Taj Exotica Goa, India. Source:RIA Novosti On Oct. 15-16 Russian President Vladimir Putin travelled to India to participate in the annual BRICS summit held this year in Goa. Apart from discussing the future work of BRICS, the Russian leader held talks with India’s Prime Minister Narendra Modi on a wide spectrum of issues on the bilateral agenda. To discuss the results of the talks and the impact of recent military drills on Russia-India relations, Russia Direct reached out to Vyacheslav Trubnikov, member of the board of directors of the Institute of World Economy and International Relations (IMEMO) of the Russian Academy of Sciences, and Ambassador Extraordinary and Plenipotentiary of the Russian Federation to India (2004-2009). He explained why one should not worry about the future of Russia-India relations and shared his view on the closure of Russian media outlets working in Indian languages. 
What is the most important result of the Russian President’s visit to India in the context of Russia-India relations? What was the main takeaway? The key result is the confirmation and further development of the privileged status of Russia’s strategic ties with India. During the visit 20 documents were signed and though, of course, some of them were more important than others, I think that a very serious step forward was made. I wouldn’t say that it is a breakthrough in bilateral relations – it’s rather a gradual development. Vyacheslav Trubnikov. Source: Boris Prihodko/RIA Novosti Today, the scale of our cooperation is growing and the important factor here is that both countries share common approaches to current developments in the international arena. This was expressed in the joint statement titled “ Partnership for Peace and Stability on the Planet .” This is a very important document, which apart from bilateral relations, also helps to form our understanding of how the future polycentric (i.e. multipolar) world might look like. Deputy Foreign Minister of India Sujata Mehta once called Indian foreign policy a “flexible multilateralism,” which I would interpret as a multi-vector foreign policy. The recent negotiations between Putin and Modi showed that Indians are very close to the Russian perception of a multi-vector foreign policy and the countries often have the same or very similar approaches to any particular issue. This is the main takeaway from Putin’s visit. What is more, the leaders considered a wide group of current problems from very pragmatic standpoints that were transparent to each other. It is very important that the countries have managed to maintain the ability to understand each other very well. Sometimes representatives of both sides – such as government officials, diplomats, military leaders and experts – find themselves as prisoners of Soviet-era stereotypes or, on the contrary, think that everything remains as it is and nothing is changing. These are polar-opposite attitudes. The key here is that both sides take into account the interests of each other in pursuing their own national goals. The relationship India and Russia share is indeed one of privileged status and strategic importance. What about economic ties? What is being done to improve the current situation and fulfill the huge potential of cooperation in this area? 
India is Russia's especially privileged strategic partner: Putin We have a very limited trade turnover. There is no doubt about it. The countries have outstanding political relations, but the trade turnover does not reflect the vast economic potential. The volume of mutual investment does not reflect our capabilities as well – today they are at a level of $12 billion with $8 billion coming from India. So Indians are much more active in this respect, maybe due to their experience in working in foreign markets. RD: What about economic ties? What is being done to improve the current situation and fulfill the huge potential of cooperation in this area? Russia’s strong orientation to the West led to Russian companies being more interested in European and U.S. markets. Despite the sanctions, our missiles are still being produced in the U.S. Americans continue to cooperate when they have no option, notwithstanding the sanctions. Speaking about Russia’s pivot to the East, from my view, is not entirely correct. It is simply an alignment of our relations with the rest of the world. And now efforts are being made in this direction. The key thing here to understand is that the memoranda of mutual understanding only show the willingness of sides to cooperate. We can only talk about something when the contract is signed and sides are starting to implement it. This is a step-by-step work. Take, for example, the decision to create a free trade zone with India, which is due to be made in December by the Eurasian Economic Union. It’s not simple and it will require us to think about how to develop this aspect of our relationship. Discussing logistics will be key here. The establishment of economic corridors and energy bridges will require a lot of work on the ground. This can only be done gradually after necessary agreements are prepared and then signed. This is a serious question that requires a lot of time. Another example is the program signed between the Russian Ministry of Energy and India’s Ministry of Petroleum and Natural Gas to expand cooperation between the two countries in energy. This program will have to be fulfilled by specific projects and contracts later, and then it can be implemented. The countries are quite far away from each other and the questions of logistics and transportation of energy products will be crucial. All this work will be done gradually, stage by stage. The fact that the countries have set 2025 as a due date shows that both of them have considered this issue with responsibility. Overall, I would say that the cooperation now is moving in the right direction and is likely to provide a basis for future breakthroughs in trade turnover and energy cooperation. While the demand for energy in India is growing, the country does not enjoy many of its own energy sources, so that will give the basis for more active cooperation with Russia. 
Russia and India: A civilizational friendship What is your position towards the closure of many media outlets in Russia working in Indian languages? What are the implications of that? 
I’m strongly against it. The liquidation of media coverage that previously was done in eight Indian languages leads to a situation when Indians have less and less knowledge about Russia. The situation is similar in Russia as well: Russian businessmen don’t know how India looks like today. That’s why they are very cautious about entering the Indian market. Indian bureaucracy is sometimes a push-off factor, but the Modi government is making steps to liquidate many of the bureaucratic obstacles changing the tax system and making the environment for foreign investors more transparent. But if our businessmen don’t know about it, they will not go there. The same is applicable to Indians, though they know us a bit better. However, they get their information mostly from Western sources. Economic cooperation requires a systemic approach and in this respect I support the upcoming opening of the office of the Russian Export Center in India. People working there will be researching the developments on the Indian market and business climate. Once the TASS news agency had a correspondent in Delhi to report on the situation in the Indian market. Today I don’t know if someone is doing or is able to do this. All this leads to a situation when the countries don’t even know about the opportunities existing for effective cooperation. For instance, India’s southern states allow for all-year shipbuilding as opposed to Russia’s traditional shipyards, where the construction takes place only half a year. If India and Russia developed joint shipbuilding projects in India’s southern states that could benefit both states. The problem here is the lack of information about each other, which leads to missed opportunities. The interview is abridged. Read the full version published by Russia Direct . Facebook",1

Downturn in Russo-British relations a danger for global security,"russia-uk relations , uk , patriarch kirill , london Drawing by Alexei Iorsh Source: Iorsh 
After the Brexit referendum and the subsequent change of government in the UK, a number of experts and observers expected an improvement in Russo-British relations. Perhaps unwittingly, former British Prime Minister David Cameron inspired these unfounded expectations. Cameron’s constantly repeated allegations that Russian President Vladimir Putin supported a vote for Brexit made people expect a somewhat softer line on Russia from the new governing team in London who were, after all, supporters of Brexit and opponents of Cameron. 
When Boris Johnson became the new foreign secretary, several MPs were even concerned about him not being “tough enough” with Russia and making “conciliatory” calls to his Russian counterpart, foreign minister Sergei Lavrov. 
Johnson quickly proved these concerns wrong, issuing a call for protests near the Russian Embassy in London as a way to punish Moscow for its actions in Syria. “This is something unprecedented in the world of diplomacy,” Alexey Pushkov, former head of the Duma’s committee on international affairs, said in an interview to Vesti FM radio station. “A diplomat calling for non-diplomatic solutions, with popular anger mobilized – this is something new.” Pushkov also noted Johnson’s tough statement accusing Russia of deliberately killing Syrian civilians with “repeated bombings.”“They drop one bomb and then they wait for the aid workers to come out pulling the injured from the rubble, and then five minutes later they drop another bomb,” Boris Johnson said in an interview with the tabloid The Sun. 
“Boris Johnson is showing a flamboyant attitude where it is needed least of all,” Pushkov replied. 
For their part, the Russian authorities, disappointed by Johnson, are also changing their tone, trying to drive home to both foreign and domestic audiences the message that they are angry. 
“Decent people first provide the evidence, and only later they come out with accusations,” said Maria Zakharova, spokesperson for the Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs, in response to Johnson’s interview with The Sun. Seeing the bigger picture 
Both Johnson and Zakharova have provided plenty of fodder for the media, but all commentary and posturing aside, the decline in Russo-British relations is detrimental not just for the two countries at hand, but also for global security at large. 
“We should not forget that the world was once brought to the brink of a nuclear disaster not because of European problems, but because of a conflict over a distant land – Cuba. When I hear British voices suggesting that NATO forces should impose a no-fly zone over northern Syria by striking at the airfields of the Syrian or Russian air forces in Syria – I get really worried,” Alexei Pushkov said. “In this situation, tough statements with a strong populist message – such as the talk about “warning strikes” in Syria – such statements are not just tasteless, they are plain dangerous.” Patriarch’s visit to London hailed as step toward reconciliation with West Media tensions were somewhat eased by the visit to the UK by Russian Orthodox Patriarch Kirill. During his visit, which took place on Oct. 15-18, the Patriarch deliberately avoided controversial issues, playing down the conflict between the Russian and British governments. “Political differences won’t be able to disrupt the relations between Russia and Britain on the basic level, on the level of people-to-people ties,” Patriarch Kirill said, speaking to journalists before his flight back to Moscow. “I am often asked about our church’s position on Ukraine. My answer is that there can be only one position: to reconcile the people, to lessen the tension, to end the bloody clashes.”
Trying to minimize the damage from the conflict between Russia and Ukraine, the Russian Orthodox Church still recognizes Crimea as a canonical territory of its Ukrainian “Orthodox sister church.” For two years, Patriarch Kirill avoided any political comments on the recent “regime change” in Ukraine. When the Ukrainian government barred him from visiting Kiev, the cradle of Orthodox Christianity in ancient Rus, Kirill did not protest. In this way, the Russian Orthodox Church is offering a good example of forgiveness and compromise. Several British MPs protested against what they called a “red carpet reception” for Patriarch Kirill in London because of Kirill’s loyalty to Putin, but the Patriarch did not pronounce a single word of anger or even sadness, meeting instead with Queen Elizabeth, the titular head of the Church of England, and blessing by his presence the opening of a renovated Orthodox cathedral in London. 
“Since the early stages of deterioration of relations between Russia and the West, the church leaders have often been doing the diplomats’ jobs in Russia’s relations with the West,” wrote Moscow-based Nezavisimaya Gazeta, deviating from its usual line, which is very critical of Kirill. 
This is perhaps not the worst of developments: at a time when diplomats are often sacrificing security and professionalism in order to boost their standing in the mass media, the church is trying to remember and celebrate the positive legacy of Russo-British relations. This is done not so much for the sake of history, as for the sake of a secure future. Sooner or later, this cursory attitude towards diplomacy will have to give way to wisdom and responsibility.

Moscow downplays Spain’s refusal to let Russian warship refuel in Ceuta,"navy , RBTH Daily , spain , syria Russian aircraft carrier Admiral Kuznetsov in international waters off the coast of Northern Norway on Oct. 17, 2016. Source: Reuters 
Madrid has decided not to allow the Russian aircraft carrier Admiral Kuznetsov to refuel in the port of Ceuta, a Spanish enclave on the North African coast, reneging on a previous agreement with Moscow. 
On Oct. 26, the warships of the Northern Fleet's aircraft carrier group led by the cruiser Admiral Kuznetsov , having passed the English Channel, were moving toward Gibraltar. 
Their route and tasks, according to presidential spokesman Dmitry Peskov, are ""in a sealed envelope marked 'Top Secret'."" 
As the Spanish Foreign Ministry said earlier, the ships were to arrive on Oct. 28 in the port of Ceuta (a Spanish enclave in Morocco). The permit, as Madrid noted, was issued in September. 
However, when the news of the imminent arrival of the ships in Ceuta made the press, Spain came under heavy criticism from its NATO allies. 
NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg said that he would not have had anything against the refueling of Russian ships in other circumstances, but now he was extremely concerned that they could be used to attack Aleppo. Similar statements were made by politicians and military figures from the UK and the U.S. 
In Spain itself, the Republican Left of Catalonia was most vocal in protesting against the arrival of the Russian ships in Ceuta. Their press service confirmed to Kommersant that members of the Congress of Deputies of Spain from the party had demanded that acting Foreign Minister Jose Manuel Garcia-Margallo and acting Defense Minister Pedro Morenesa explain why Russian ships involved in the Syrian operation were being serviced in the territory of a NATO country. 9 intriguing facts about the Admiral Kuznetsov aircraft carrier 
Initially, the Ceuta authorities were confused about the situation. Since 2011, the enclave's port has been visited, according to the newspaper El Pais, by 60 Russian vessels. 
""The normal criteria for accepting the visits was 'the safety of the surroundings, population and port',"" The Spain Report said, citing sources in the port's administration. But under the barrage of criticism, the Spanish Foreign Ministry announced yesterday that it was reviewing ""the decision following consultations."" 
But by the middle of the day, El Pais quoted diplomatic sources as saying permission would be revoked if it was confirmed that the ships were heading to Syria. Without waiting for the outcome, the Russian authorities themselves abandoned the idea. ""We affirm that the ships will not enter the port of Ceuta, because the route has changed,"" the Russian Embassy in Spain said. Moscow's reaction 
Speaking to Kommersant, the Embassy's press secretary Vasily Nioradze Embassy urged the media not to dramatize the situation. ""Approval of such stopovers is a routine process,"" he said. ""We send a request in advance, and the decision is made based on international law and the requirements of the host country. Now this decision was made, in other cases it will be different."" 
Defense Ministry spokesman Igor Konashenkov chose to place a different accent on the incident: According to him, the Russian military department provided for the possibility of ""a technical stopover [in Ceuta – Kommersant] of individual ships or a supply vessel from the group of ships, in agreement with the Spanish side."" 
However, according to him, no official request from the Defense Ministry was sent to Madrid. 
""The representatives of the Spanish leadership said that due to the pressure on them from the U.S. and NATO, the entry of the Russian ships in the port of Ceuta would be inappropriate,"" said Konashenkov. Publicly, however, the Spanish authorities did not make such statements. Russian experts: Cruiser is on training mission 
Ruslan Pukhov, director of the Center for Analysis of Strategies and Technologies (TsAST), does not view the change of the Admiral Kuznetsov 's route as a disaster. 
""We might as well refuel in Algeria or Malta, I’m betting on Algeria since Malta is an EU member state and it will face the same problems as Spain,"" he told Kommersant. Russia to establish a permanent naval base in Syria 
At the same time, according to Pukhov, the arrival of the Admiral Kuznetsov in Syria is unlikely to radically change the balance of forces in the region, but it will allow Russia to increase its international prestige. 
""The French use an aircraft carrier in that region, because they do not have a base, while we do have one,"" he said. “The purpose of the Kuznetsov 's mission is likely to be training. Pilots of deck aircraft need to train, and Syria provides an opportunity to do it in combat conditions."" 
TsAST expert Andrei Frolov added that the Admiral Kuznetsov 's mission has ""an advertising component.""""India is thinking about buying MiG-29K/KUB deck fighters for future aircraft carriers, and a demonstration of their capabilities in Syria will help it decide sooner,” he said.

“Las presiones de EE UU y la OTAN han influido en España” | Noticias de Rusia | RBTH,"españa , almirante kuznetsov , ceuta , portaaviones Imagen del portaaviones Almirante Kuznetsov. Fuente:Reuters 
La ruta y la misión del portaaviones Almirante Kuznetsov, según el secretario de prensa del presidente de la Federación de Rusia, Dmitri Peskov, se encuentran en un sobre cerrado en el que se lee “Completamente secreto”. 
Sin embargo, según informaba anteriormente el Ministerio de Asuntos Exteriores español, se preveía que el portaaviones llegara al puerto de Ceuta el 28 de octubre . En Madrid señalan que el permiso correspondiente se expidió el pasado mes de septiembre. 
No obstante, en cuanto la noticia sobre la inminente llegada de los buques a Ceuta llegó a la prensa, España comenzó a recibir críticas de sus aliados en la OTAN. 
El secretario general de la Alianza, Jens Stoltenberg, señaló que en otras condiciones no tendría nada que objetar al abastecimiento de los buques rusos, pero que en la actualidad está extremadamente preocupado porque estos “puedan utilizarse para atacar Alepo”. 
Otros políticos de Gran Bretaña y EE UU hicieron declaraciones similares. 
En España las críticas más duras que ha recibido el gobierno provienen de Esquerra Republicana de Catalunya. Su servicio de prensa ha confirmado a Kommersant que los miembros del Congreso de los Diputados de este partido han exigido al ministro de Asuntos Exteriores en funciones, José Manuel García-Margallo y al ministro de Defensa en funciones, Pedro Morenés, que expliquen por qué razón unos barcos rusos que participan en la operación siria hacen escala en Ceuta. 9 cosas que no sabías sobre el portaaviones “Almirante Kuznetsov” 
Las autoridades portuarias de las ciudad han expresado su descontento por lo sucedido. Desde el año 2011 por este puerto han pasado, según el El País , más de 60 buques rusos. 
“Los criterios para permitir la escala en Ceuta son la seguridad del medio ambiente, de la ciudad y de su población”, cita el periódico The Spain Report a fuentes en la administración del puerto. Sin embargo, debido al aluvión de críticas recibidas, el Ministerio de Asuntos Exteriores de España anunció ayer que “iba a celebrar una consulta para estudiar la decisión”. 
Hacia el mediodía de ayer la embajada de Rusia en Madrid comunicó a Exteriores que retiraba la petición de permisos de escala para la escala de los buques y, por lo tanto, quedan canceladas. “Confirmamos que nuestros barcos no entrarán en el puerto de Ceuta porque se ha modificado su ruta”, declaraban desde la embajada. La reacción de Moscú 
Vasili Nioradze, secretario de prensa de la embajada, instaba a no dramatizar la situación en declaraciones a Kommersant. 
“La negociación sobre este tipo de escalas en los puertos es un procedimiento rutinario –señalaba este-. Nosotros enviamos la solicitud de forma anticipada y para tomar una decisión al respecto se tiene en cuenta el derecho internacional y los requisitos del país. En esta ocasión se ha decidido una cosa, y en otros casos la respuesta será distinta”. 
Ígor Konashenkov, representante oficial del Ministerio de Defensa explica que el departamento ruso contemplaba la posibilidad “de la escala acordada con el gobierno español de algunos buques o embarcaciones de apoyo de la flotilla rusa”. 
Sin embargo, según el representante del Ministerio de Defensa ruso, no se envió ninguna solicitud oficial. 
Además, comenta: “Los representantes del gobierno español han declarado que debido a la presión de Estados Unidos y de la OTAN el paso de buques rusos por el puerto de Ceuta no es oportuno”. Las autoridades de España no han hecho ninguna declaración similar en público. Madrid ha perdido dinero 
El director del Centro de Análisis de Estrategias y Tecnología, Ruslán Pújov, no ve ninguna tragedia en el cambio de ruta del Almirante Kuznetsov. 
“Nuestros buques pueden repostar sin problemas en Argelia o en Malta. Apuesto por Argelia, ya que Malta es miembro de la UE y se enfrentará a los mismos problemas que España”, informa el experto a Kommersant . 
Según Pújov, la llegada del grupo del Almirante Kuznetsov a Siria apenas cambiará la correlación de fuerzas en la región, aunque sí permitirá a Rusia elevar su prestigio internacional. 
“Los franceses tienen un portaaviones en la región porque no tienen base, pero nosotros sí que tenemos–declara el experto-. La misión del Kuznetsov es más bien una operación de entrenamiento. Los pilotos de los aviones navales necesitan entrenar y Siria les ofrece la posibilidad de hacerlo en condiciones de combate reales”. 
El experto del mismo centro Andréi Frolov añade que la expedición del Almirante Kuznetsov también tiene un “componente publicitario”: La India está pensando en comprar cazas navales MiG-29K/KUB para sus futuros portaaviones, y la demostración de sus características en Siria podría ayudarle a decidirse”.

Rating: Moody‘s verbessert Ausblick für Russlands Banken,"bankensektor Der russische Staat werde die Banken weiterhin stützen. Quelle:AP 
Die Ratingagentur Moody’s prognostiziert bessere Gewinnaussichten für russische Banken in diesem Jahr – trotz der Verschlechterung von Aktiva und Zunahme von Problemkrediten. 
Der russische Staat werde die Banken weiterhin stützen, wie aus zahlreichen Erklärungen der Notenbank und der Regierung des Landes hervorgehe, heißt es in der Moody’s-Mitteilung. Dies habe dazu geführt, dass die Agentur das Rating russischen Bankwesens von negativ auf stabil gehoben habe. 
„Die langsame Erholung der Wirtschaft und die makroökonomische Stabilisierung in Russland werden das Arbeitsumfeld für russische Banken tragen“, so Moody’s weiter. 
Laut Stanislaw Kleschtschew, Chef-Analyst bei VTB24, ist die Verbesserung der Finanzlage russischer Banken hauptsächlich auf die Leitzinssenkung von vergangenem September auf 10 Prozent zurückzuführen. 
Anton Strutschenewskij, Chef-Ökonom bei Sberbank CIB, bekräftigt: Die zuversichtlichere Prognose sei begründet, „weil die Rezession der Wirtschaft gestoppt ist und die Unternehmensumsätze heute höher sind als vor zwei Jahren“, sagt er. 
Auch Standard & Poor’s verbesserte ihre Aussichten für Russland: Im September dieses Jahres erhöhte die Agentur das Rating des Landes von negativ auf stabil – wegen gesunkener externer Risiken. Fitch Ratings wertet Russlands Wirtschaftslage ebenfalls als stabil und bestätigt das Land auf dem Niveau BBB-.",1
„The Duelist“: Martins Wuttkes neuer Tatort,"film , deutschland und russland Der neue Film des Regisseurs Alexei Misgirew zeigt Russland im 19. Jahrhundert. Sankt Petersburg sprach damals schon Deutsch. Quelle:Kinopoisk.ru 
Alexei Misgirews Film „Duellant“ (The Duelist) stieß schon während der Produktion auf große Resonanz in der internationalen Filmindustrie. Seine Weltpremiere feierte der Streifen schließlich auf dem Toronto Film Festival. Eine Kooperation mit IMAX ermöglicht nun seinen Verleih in den USA und einigen anderen Ländern. Bis zu diesem Erfolg hatte Misgirew in Russland den Ruf eines „Regisseurs der zweiten Reihe“. Seine Filme kamen alle nur in den begrenzten Verleih, wo sie ein Publikum von wenigen Tausend Zuschauern erreichten. Jetzt realisierte Misgirew zusammen mit dem Produzenten Alexander Rodnianski („Jayne Mansfield’s Car“, „Cloud Atlas“, „Leviathan“) eines der größten Projekte der Geschichte des neueren russischen Kinos. 
„The Duelist“ ist ein in den 1860er-Jahren spielendes Kostümdrama über einen Auftragsmörder. Der Held des Films, der Offizier Jakowlew, duelliert sich stellvertretend für andere. Aus unerklärlichen Gründen kann ihn keine Kugel töten, und so gewinnt er jeden seiner Zweikämpfe. Vor dem Start des internationalen Verleihs sprach Misgirew mit RBTH über seinen neuen Film. RBTH: Bisher waren Sie im Autorenfilm mit kleinem Budget zuhause. Wie geht es Ihnen jetzt als Regisseur eines Films, der für die Verhältnisse der russischen Filmindustrie richtig teuer ist? 
Alexei Misgirew: Das werde ich oft gefragt. Anfangs hat mich diese Frage aus dem Konzept gebracht. Ich wusste keine Antwort, weil ich selbst keinen großen Unterschied gemerkt habe. Natürlich hatten wir bei den Dreharbeiten für „The Duelist“ keine finanziellen Probleme, zum Beispiel mit den Requisiten und Kostümen. Wir haben dort gedreht, wo wir es wollten, ohne an irgendeiner Ausstattung sparen zu müssen. Was aber den Prozess selbst betrifft, gab es keinen Unterschied zu meinen anderen Projekten. Ich habe meine Arbeitsweise nicht geändert und mich niemandem untergeordnet. Das ist überhaupt das oberste Prinzip von Alexander Rodnianski in seiner Zusammenarbeit mit Regisseuren – sich nicht in den kreativen Prozess einzumischen und Kompromisse zu finden. Wir standen dauernd im engen Austausch über bestimmte Fragen, es gab aber keinerlei Vorgaben. Uns war beiden klar, dass es im Film Serienproduktionen und Einzelproduktionen gibt. Und „The Duelist“ ist eine Einzelproduktion, für die Individualität und filmischer Autorenstil besonders wichtig sind; neben einer spannenden Geschichte und einem zeitgemäßen visuellen Konzept. 
Der Regisseur Alexei Misgirew. Foto: Ekaterina Chesnokova/RIA Novosti Ihre früheren Arbeiten hatten alle einen sehr sozialkritischen Charakter und erzählten aus dem Leben im heutigen Russland. Und hier tauchen wir in eine Welt der Bälle, Kostüme, Duelle und Adeligen in Camisolen ein. Woher das Interesse an dieser Epoche? 
Das Budget für „The Duelist“ betrug 16,5 Millionen US-Dollar, rund 15,1 Millionen Euro. Jeder Regisseur des Autorenfilms wünscht sich ein Millionenpublikum. Wenn er aber nur ein bis zwei Millionen US-Dollar ausgeben kann, wird er kaum einen bildgewaltigen und spektakulären Film drehen können. Natürlich will er es, es ist aber aus objektiven Gründen nicht möglich. So ist das Interesse an der Gegenwart zu erklären. Teilweise ist es erzwungen, weil es keinen großen Aufwand für teure Kulissen und Computereffekte erfordert.
Die Idee für „The Duelist“ kam mir vor einigen Jahren. Sie lag als schriftliche Notiz von nicht mehr als zwei Absätzen einfach in einer Schublade. Und plötzlich machte es „Klick“– und ich wusste, dass ich mein Vorhaben jetzt realisieren musste. Und obwohl es bis zu seiner Umsetzung noch ein langer Weg war, wusste ich irgendwie, dass meine größten Probleme in diesem Fall nicht finanzieller Art sein würden. 
Eine Szene aus dem Film ""The Duelist"". Bild: kinopoisk.ru Welche Probleme meinen Sie? 
Sie betreffen das 19. Jahrhundert, und um genau zu sein: das Bild, das die audiovisuelle Kunst dieser Epoche geprägt hat. Während meiner Vorarbeiten für „The Duelist“ habe ich unzählige Quellen über diese Zeit durchforstet. Ich stellte fest, dass wir überhaupt nichts darüber wissen. Tatsächlich redeten, aßen, tranken und kleideten sich die Leute ganz und gar nicht so, wie wir landläufig denken. Der Zuschauer von heute assoziiert mit dem 19. Jahrhundert Geschichten aus der Mottenkiste und ehrwürdige Dramen aus dem Provinztheater. Ich wollte diese Stereotype aufbrechen und die Zeit so zeigen, wie es noch niemand vor mir getan hat – schrill, brutal und mit Verweisen auf die Gegenwart. Das war natürlich unglaublich viel Arbeit, aber die hat mich nicht abgeschreckt. Vielmehr haben mich die möglichen Reaktionen der Zuschauer auf diesen neuen Stil im Rückblick auf alte Zeiten beunruhigt. Hier werden tradierte Muster radikal in Frage gestellt. 
Im Film von Misgirew erscheint Sankt Petersburg als grau, schwarz und schmutzig. Bild: kinopoisk.ru Bezogen auf sein visuelles Konzept wurde „The Duelist“ schon mehrfach mit Guy Ritchies „Sherlock Holmes“ und Pitofs „Vidocq“ verglichen. Gefallen Ihnen diese Parallelen? 
Solche Vergleiche sind zulässig. Hier werden allerdings sehr artifizielle Filme herangezogen, echte Genre-Werke. „The Duelist“ hat aber doch einen etwas anderen Zuschnitt, unter anderem wenn wir über sein visuelles Konzept sprechen. 
Die schöne Fürstin Marfa Tutschkowa (l.) wird zur Geliebten des Duellants. Bild: kinopoisk.ru Im Zusammenhang mit „The Duelist“ werden Sie immer wieder nach dem Motiv der Ehre befragt, das sich wie ein roter Faden durch den Film zieht. Sie antworten erwartungsgemäß, Ehre sei eine zeitlose Idee. Die Geschichte verweise daher zwangsläufig auf die Gegenwart. Man hat aber den Eindruck, dass der Fatalismus, der alle Helden auszeichnet, in Ihrem Film nicht weniger bedeutend ist. Die Betonung der unausweichlichen Verbindungen der Figuren mit ihrem Schicksal ist wohl kein Zufall? 
Ja, das ist ein weiteres wichtiges Motiv dieses Films. Während meiner intensiven Beschäftigung mit Geschichten über Duelle bin ich auf ein sehr beeindruckendes Detail gestoßen: Im Heimatland der Duelle, in Frankreich, hatten diese im 19. Jahrhundert praktisch keine Bedeutung mehr. Gleiches lässt sich auch von viele anderen Ländern sagen. Der Grund war die Verbreitung der Schusswaffe, die den tödlichen Ausgang des Kampfes weitaus wahrscheinlicher machte als der Degen, und die Chancen der Gegner einander anglich. In Russland ließ gerade das die Kultur der Duelle aufblühen. Ich denke, das hängt mit dem Fatalismus zusammen, der bis heute eines der markantesten Merkmale der russischen Mentalität ist. „Held oder Verderben“– das ist eine sehr russische Entgegensetzung, selbst wenn es um Leben und Tod geht. Und genau darum geht es in „The Duelist“. RBTH-Check: 
In „The Duelist“ wird viel deutsch gesprochen. In zwei wichtigen Rollen – denen des deutschen Barons und Duellanten-Vermittlers sowie der Großfürstin Alexandra Iosifowna – sind mit Martin Wuttke und Franziska Petri deutsche Filmstars zu sehen. Alle Rechte vorbehalten",1
How does the Soviet past affect Russia's relations with the world?,"fall of the ussr , Valdai , sochi In days when modern Moscow is being accused of pursuing similar ambitions to the USSR, the assembled experts tried to formulate the basic myths about Russia’s Soviet past. Source: Panthermedia / Vostock-photo 
The world's leading scholars and analysts from the Valdai Club have analyzed collapse of the Soviet Union and compared the direction of current Russian foreign policy to that of its predecessor at a meeting of the international discussion forum in Sochi on Oct. 24-27. 
In days when modern Moscow is being accused of pursuing similar ambitions to the USSR, the assembled experts tried to formulate the basic myths about Russia’s Soviet past and discussed whether the Kremlin is seeking to re-establish. Deliberately dismantled? 
""I do not believe that there is an inevitability that in 1991 the Soviet Union had to collapse. There are plenty of reasons why it did not have to occur then,"" Robert Legvold, Professor Emeritus at Columbia University and director of the Euro-Atlantic Security Initiative, told RBTH, adding that none of the main theories that experts put forward in their search for the causes of the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991 explain the phenomenon fully. 
Wherever the reasons for the collapse were hidden – in the political and economic system of the USSR or the problem of nationalities that fueled separatist aspirations in some parts of the multinational association – it is still impossible to say with certainty why the Soviet Union collapsed in 1991, said Legvold. 
13th annual meeting of Valdai Discussion Club in Sochi / Source: Anatoly Strunin / TASS 
The failure to completely understand the reasons for the collapse of the Soviet Union fuels the opinion that the Soviet Union was deliberately dismantled. 
""In Russia, too many people believe that the Soviet Union was dismantled, rather than that it broke down on its own,"" Andrei Tsygankov, a professor at the departments of political science and international relations at San Francisco State University, told RBTH. 
The view that the crisis in the Soviet Union was not of a structural nature is confirmed by the fact that in 1988 the economic situation in the USSR improved, Tsygankov said. 
""Perhaps it was not a structural, but a cyclical crisis. If the policies had been different, it would have been possible to change the situation,"" he suggested. 
However, an even more interesting question, according to Tsygankov, concerns the extrapolation of the principles of Soviet foreign policy to modern Russia. Few ambitions 
""The train has left,"" said Richard Sakwa, Professor of Russian and European politics at the University of Kent, responding to RBTH's question about whether Moscow is looking for the impact on other countries that it had in Soviet times. 
It is a mistake to think that any strengthening of Russian influence in the post-Soviet space should necessarily mean the Kremlin's desire to recreate the Soviet Union, he explained. 
Legvold agreed, arguing that Russian President Vladimir Putin’s infamous words about the collapse of the USSR being ""the greatest geopolitical catastrophe of the century"" should not be interpreted as his desire to restore the Soviet Union at the earliest opportunity. Putin: Use of 'mythical' Russian military threat a ‘profitable business' 
Contemporary Moscow has no ambitions to involve neighboring countries in Cold War-era blocs, believes Legvold. According to the expert, Russia, like any country, wants to have a say in making regional decisions affecting its interests, but this does not mean that Russia is looking for a way to gain full control over its neighbors. 
That is why the countries of the Western world should not take Russia as a potential aggressor; Moscow's main task now is to improve the economic and demographic situation in the country, says John Mearsheimer, a professor of political science at the University of Chicago. 
At the same time, a number of those gathered in Sochi expressed a belief that criticism of Russian integration initiatives is due to the fact that they call into question the faith of the Western countries that there is no alternative to the modern world order. 
""The universal system established by the West after 1991 is trying to […] homogenize political space across the globe,"" said Sakwa. ""The development of BRICS and other alternatives is precisely the argument to say that there is now an alternative force, where this unipolar universalism no longer applies."" 
At the same time, Moscow is not looking for ways to oppose the Western world with an alternative world order deliberately, according to experts, who are convinced that Russia's foreign policy initiatives, including its increasingly close cooperation with China, is due primarily to the U.S. and EU policies toward Moscow. 
""Russians tend to react to the Americans […]. It is the Americans pushing the Russians towards the Chinese which, I believe, is not in America’s national interests,"" said Mearsheimer.",1

Les hélicoptères de combat russes Ka-52K utiliseront pour la première fois les missiles antichars guidés (MAC) Hermes en Syrie dans la lutte contre l'organisation terroriste Daech, informe le quotidien Izvestia . 
« Les essais sur le terrain permettront de finaliser le complexe de missiles qui fera ensuite partie de l’arsenal permanent des hélicoptères de combat russes Alligator. Il a été décidé de tester Hermes dans des conditions plus difficiles à bord d’un navire » , écrit le quotidien citant sa source au sein du complexe militaro-industriel russe. Qu’est-ce qu’Hermes et à quoi sert-il Buk-M3 et Kalibr : de nouvelles armes pour l’armée russe Selon les informations d’ Izvestia , la nouvelle arme permettra aux hélicoptères Ka-52K de détruite les chars ennemis, les fortifications et les cibles vivantes à une distance de 30 kilomètres. Pour le moment, la portée des modèles équivalents utilisés par les systèmes russes et étrangers (Ataka, Vikhr, Hellfire, etc.) est inférieure à dix kilomètres. 
Le colonel à la retraite et expert militaire chez TASS Victor Litovkine explique qu’Hermes sera utilisé contre les sites bien protégés des islamistes – les usines d’armement et les engins explosifs improvisés, ainsi que contre les postes de commandement et les installations de tir temporaires. « L’utilisation sur le terrain permettra de décider si le complexe doit être amélioré ou s’il peut être adopté en l’état » , précise l’expert. Les particularités d’Hermes 
Les experts interrogés par RBTH soulignent que la particularité principale du missile est la possibilité d’un usage « horizontal » . La tête autoguidée combinée au capteur infrarouge et au canal laser permet au missile d’atteindre les véhicules blindés de l’ennemi, même s’ils se trouvent hors du champ de vision de l’équipage de l’hélicoptère.

« Le complexe israélien Spike-NLOS, monté sur un châssis à roues, peut accomplir des missions techniques similaires. Mais le complexe russe peut être utilisé tant sur des véhicules terrestres à chenilles que sur les hélicoptères et les navires. Hermes est plus universel » , a appris RBTH auprès du ministère russe de la Défense. Il précise que les informations officielles sur le missile seront publiées après son adoption par l’ armée . 
« Aujourd’hui, on peut seulement affirmer que sa portée est largement supérieure à celle des complexes antichars étrangers, la plus grande étant de dix kilomètres pour ces derniers » , souligne notre interlocuteur. Il ajoute que l’ogive du missile peut être tant cumulative qu’explosive et incendiaire.

Les hélicoptères de navire Ka-52 Katran ont été conçus spécialement pour les bâtiments de débarquement français du type Mistral . Cependant, sous la pression des alliés au sein de l’ Otan , François Hollande a été contraint de rompre le contrat de vente de ces navires à la Russie, rappelle Vadim Koziouline, professeur de l’Académie des sciences militaires. 
Au final, les Mistral ont été rachetés par l’Égypte et, dans la foulée, le Caire acheta un lot de 50 Katran russes à Moscou . Les hélicoptères restants ont été affectés à l’Amiral Kouznetsov pour subir un « baptême de feu » en fin d’année. 
L’expert précise que les modèles « terrestres » de Ka-52 se sont avérés efficaces dans la campagne syrienne . Les nouveaux engins devront également démontrer leurs capacités militaires aux futurs acheteurs. 
Les hélicoptères peuvent utiliser les missiles air-air R-73 et Igla-B, les missiles non-guidés « air-sol » et les missiles guidés antichars Hermes. Lire aussi :",1

Vladikavkaz, chef-lieu de l’Ossétie du Nord (Caucase russe), est souvent qualifiée de « Saint-Pétersbourg du Caucase » , car aucune autre ville de la région ne compte autant de représentants du monde créatif : peintres, photographes et artistes. 
« Dans mon village natal, on aimait raconter cette blague : jetez une balalaïka par la fenêtre, celui qui l’attrapera commencera à en jouer » , raconte l’Ossète Alik Pagaïev, chef de la troupe du théâtre équestre Narty de Vladikavkaz.

Toutefois, la créativité n’est pas l’unique trait national. Toujours d’après Alik Pagaïev, les Ossètes sont très ouverts à tout ce qui est nouveau, très respectueux envers les valeurs des autres et n’oublient jamais leurs racines. Histoire 
Les Ossètes tirent leur origine des nomades iranophones, les Scythes et les Sarmates. Dans les chroniques du IIe siècle ap. J.-C., ces tribus étaient considérées comme une sérieuse force militaire et politique . Lire aussi : Les Balkars, un peuple montagnard contre vents et marées 
L’Etat médiéval d’Alanie existait déjà au XIe siècle. Ses habitants étaient réputés dans la région pour leur habileté militaire . Le noyau de leur armée était la cavalerie. 
Malgré ce talent, ils furent balayés par l’offensive mongole et pratiquement exterminés vers le XIVe siècle. Il ne restait plus dans les montagnes que quelques centaines d’habitants. Pourtant, le peuple a réussi à survivre et à s’assimiler plus tard en Russie. 
Le monde compte actuellement environ 700 000 Ossètes dont 528 500 habitent en Russie d’après le recensement de la population de 2010. La plupart vivent en Ossétie du Nord ( 459 600 ), les autres se sont installés à Moscou ( 7 900 ) et à Saint-Pétersbourg (un peu plus de 3 000 ). On en compte 45 900 en Ossétie du Sud. Ouverts aux nouvelles cultures 
« Le Caucase a commencéàêtre rattachéà la Russie au XVIIIe siècle. Les Ossètes ont perçu ces changements comme leur salut : il était très difficile de survivre en montagne, alors qu’il fallait – et l’intelligentsia le réalisait clairement – se développer , a indiqué Anna Kabissova, photographe et journaliste.

« Les Ossètes saisissent vite. Nombreux sont ceux qui s’étonnent : un jeune Ossète originaire d’un village retiré en montagne vient faire ses études à Saint-Pétersbourg ou à Moscou . Deux ans plus tard, il est complètement intégré, il parle russe sans accent et il a de très bon résultats. Je pense que c’est le trait qui a aidé notre peuple à survivre dans les temps les plus difficiles » , estime Alik Pagaïev. Offrandes aux dieux, pirojkis et bière 
Les rites chrétiens coexistent en Ossétie avec les coutumes païennes dont les traces se retrouvent dans des dizaines de fêtes populaires. Les Ossètes peuvent faire des sacrifices symboliques en tuant un poulet ou un mouton pour les offrir à leurs invités lors d’une fête. Lire aussi : Shabbat et chachlik : la vie des Juifs dans le Caucase russe 
Les célèbres pirojkis nationaux sont une nourriture rituelle. Ces chaussons, grands, ronds et fins, fourrés de viande, de fromage et de pommes de terre symbolisent pour les Ossètes le soleil. Pour toutes les fêtes, chaque famille fait cuire trois chaussons. 
Une autre tradition nationale est le brassage de la bière. Les femmes fabriquent de la bière selon une recette locale pour de nombreuses fêtes. Les Ossètes ont leur propre Oktoberfest : le festival de bière organisé chaque année au mois d’octobre à Vladikavkaz rassemble des Ossètes de toute la Russie et d’autres pays.

D’après son goût et son aspect, la boisson ressemble plus au kvas russe , mais elle est légèrement alcoolisée (1,5–2 degrés). Cette bière est brassée dans une grande chaudière sur un feu de bois. 
Les principaux ingrédients sont ceux de tous les autres peuples, le houblon et le malt, auxquels viennent s’ajouter tantôt des côtes de mouton, tantôt du sucre, tantôt… les recettes se comptent par centaines.

« Demandez-moi quelle est l’activité que j’aime le moins et je vous répondrai : faire du commerce, poursuit Alik Pagaïev. Les Ossètes ne possèdent pas le sens des affaires. Nous avons un grand nombre de peintres talentueux et de bons sportifs , surtout dans la lutte libre, ainsi que d’éleveurs de chevaux, mais nous essayons d’éviter le domaine du commerc e » . Respect des invités et amour de la langue maternelle 
Parmi les autres traits, il y a aussi le tact. « J’ai travaillé en Kabardino-Balkarie (république du Caucase russe, ndlr) et j’étais toujours étonné de leur habitude à parler leur langue devant les autres. Je viens chez des Kabardes qui m’ont invité, mais ils parlent entre eux leur langue et je ne les comprends pas. En Ossétie, s’il y a un invité, nous parlons russe » , ajoute Alik Pagaïev.

Certains jeunes des grandes villes ne parlent pas leur langue. « C’est dommage, car il est important de la préserver. Chez nous, mes enfants ne parlent qu’ossète.

Le rêve s’avéra amer : il lui fallut vivre dans des préfabriqués de chantier, ce qui ne la dissuada pas. « Je trouvais ça marrant. Tu ne fais rien à part jouer au football. On m’avait même expliqué qu’on pouvait en vivre. Bien sûr que je reste [décida Nadedja], je suis prête à me laver à l’eau froide et tout » , confie-t-elle. « Si mon père ne m’aidait pas, je crèverais de faim » Июн 6 2016 в 7:49 PDT 

Se faire une place dans le football professionnel s’avéra difficile. Après ses études, le club de l’académie, Rossiyanka, proposa à Nadejda, qui jouait alors déjà dans l’équipe jeunes de Russie, 9 000 roubles (120 euros) par mois. Ce furent les représentants d’un autre club, Zorky, qui la sauvèrent de la misère en la payant trois fois plus cher. Mais cet argent ne suffisait de toute façon pas pour quoi que ce soit. « Je ne peux rien m’acheter avec l’argent que je gagne au football , a raconté Nadjeda dans une interview à Eurosport en 2014. Je peux m’acheter une carte de métro. Si mon père ne m’aidait pas, je crèverais de faim » . 
Durant ces deux ans, Nadedja fait des débuts remarqués dans l’équipe nationale et est en tête des marqueurs du championnat russe 2016 dans l’équipe Chertanovo de Moscou. Cependant, la star du football féminin russe vit toujours modestement, comme tout le football féminin en Russie, qui paie 3 000 roubles (40 euros) de prime pour une victoire, et dont les joueuses en déplacement s’entassent dans les wagons de troisième classe.

The Russian Baltic Fleet’s Project 11540 patrol ship Yaroslav Mudry and the tanker Lena have arrived in the Cuban port of Havana on a business visit, fleet spokesman Roman Martov said. 
""The patrol ship Yaroslav Mudry and the tanker Lena have arrived in Cuba on a business visit,"" Martov said. 
""In the capital of Freedom Island, the Baltic Fleet sailors will replenish water and food supplies, carry out a planned check of the ships and have a rest after a trans-Atlantic passage,"" he added. 
In mid-October, the patrol ship Yaroslav Mudry left the Mediterranean Sea where it made part of the Russian Navy’s permanent grouping. 
The patrol ship was performing anti-piracy tasks in the Indian Ocean over several weeks. After that, the ship crossed the Mediterranean Sea to the Atlantic Ocean. 
The patrol ship started its long-distance voyage on June 1.",1

Researchers at the Kamchatka branch of the Pacific Institute of Geography of Russia’s Science Academy’s Far East Department now have the opportunity to monitor Steller sea lions that are on Russia’s Red List of Threatened Species, from space, the Komandorsky Nature Reserve’s Spokesman Alexei Veledinsky told TASS on Oct. 28. The researchers succeeded in installing five GPS tags on two full-grown sea lionesses and three cubs on the national park’s territory. 
""It was not an easy task as these animals are very timid. They had to be knocked out using tranquillizers so that they could be tagged,"" Veledinsky said. 
However, right after the animals woke up, scientists started receiving the data on their movement. In one case, a few days after being tagged, a sea lionesses and her cub travelled several hundred kilometers from the Commander Islands through the Pacific Ocean to Russia’s Kamchatka Peninsula. All of the sea lions’ movements are depicted on a map via a computer program. 
""Researchers will be able to follow the sea lions for approximately one year. The tags placed on the animals’ heads will fall off when they begin to shed their fur. That said, the tags are glued to their fur with a specific paste,"" Veledinsky explained. 10 UNESCO treasures in Russia on one map 
One of the main goals of this research is to garner scientific data on the winter habitats of the sea lions populating the Commander Islands as their number has been falling. In the 1960s and 1970s up to 12,000 sea lions used to spend the winter on the islands, while in summer there were 2,000 to 5,000 animals there. Now there are no more than 600 sea lions. The new data will enable the creation of more safe conditions in the sea lions’ rookeries. There are four rookeries where sea lionesses bear cubs on the Commander Islands, which is encompassed by the national park. Besides that, there are also three rookeries where cubs are not born.

Why Russia’s army can’t complete its modernization program,"RBTH Daily , army , military , arms The Buk-M3 anti-aircraft missile system. Source: Press Photo 
On Oct. 21, on the day the Russian army received its new military technology, Russian Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu said that in October 2016 half of all the military hardware in the Russian armed forces now consisted of new models. 
Shoigu, who also holds the rank of army general, noted that in accordance with a presidential decree, by 2020 70 percent of the army's technology will consist of updated models. The first Buk-M3 anti-aircraft missile system in the Russian army 
One of the main ""gifts"" for Russia's army was the Buk-M3 anti-aircraft missile system. Shoigu said that the armed forces had received the first division of Buk-M3s. 
""This is not only the modernization of the air defense system that the Russian army already has. Basically, this is a new model with old dimensions,"" explained Valery Yarmolenko, director of the press service at arms manufacturer Almaz-Antey. 
He noted that the Buk-M3's key particularity is the location of the missiles in the launching containers, just like in the S-300 systems, which are simultaneously transport and launching containers. 
Thanks to developments made by Russian manufacturers, the missiles can be fired from the 12 cylindrical containers 20 seconds after the system is set up. Unlike its predecessor, the new system can strike missiles and enemy planes not 15 but 70 kilometers (45 miles) away. 
The Rossiyskaya Gazeta newspaper confirms that the Buk-M3 anti-aircraft missiles can strike surface and ground radiocontrast targets – that is, they can be used as tactical-guided missiles and not only defensive weapons. What else has the Russian army received? 
In the last three months the Russian armed forces have received a series of defensive systems. Among them are the following: 
- two regimental kits of S-400 anti-aircraft missiles systems and six combat Pantsir-S machines; 
- the Bal and Bastion missile systems for the Western Military District; 
- two divisions of Buk-M2 anti-aircraft systems; 
- three intercontinental ballistic missiles; 
- 100 Kalibr winged missiles and Onyx anti-missile systems for Russian Navy ships and submarines.

Sergei Shoigu noted that during the Army-2016 Military Technological Forum near Moscow in early September Russia showed the world most of the new technology that the armed forces are now acquiring. 
""Defense ministry representatives and foreign and Russian military experts could appreciate Russia's combat possibilities during the demonstrations,"" he said. Problems with rearming the army 
""The modernization and development of the Russian armed forces program, which costs 22 trillion rubles ($343 billion today), can fully guarantee the country's security by the time it terminates in 2022. However, there is a series of problems that must be solved,"" said Viktor Yesin, former director of the General Staff of the Strategic Missile Forces. 
In his words, the modernization of the defense industry, in which three trillion rubles have already been invested ($48 billion), is failing. 
""This is due to the sanctions and the fall of Russia's economy. The process of import substitution in the defense enterprises is getting practically nowhere,"" said Yesin. Russia designing new ‘aircraft carrier killer’ torpedo to boost naval power 
According to a source in the Russian defense industry, the main problem lies in the fact that Russia will not be able to substitute imported items in a series of key sectors in the upcoming years. 
""One thing is the modernization of enterprises. But creating from scratch certain units that will produce the technology is another. The enterprises will be able to produce the ship and helicopter engines that were imported from other countries by 2018. However, there are many electronic systems accompanying these machines that Russia will not be able to produce independently,"" said the source. 
According to Russian Deputy Defense Minister Timur Ivanov, the financing of the defense industry has diminished due to the crisis, a trend that may continue in 2017. 
""Defense industry enterprises have long-term contracts to build ships, missiles, aviation and space satellites. There will be no sequestration here. During crises purchases of secondary technology – armored personnel carriers, engineer machines and so on – are reduced,"" explained the source. Why is Russia spending so much on modernizing its army? 
According to Yesin, the share of defense expenses is unquestionably very big. But if Russia wants to feel secure and not worry about tomorrow, then money must be spent today in order to avoid a repeat of the 1990s and 2000s. 
""In terms of nuclear weapons, we are on par with the U.S., but in terms of conventional weapons, we trail significantly. If we want to avoid war, we must make up for what we lacked in the 1990s and 2000s,"" said Yesin. Subscribe to get the hand picked best stories every week Subscribe to our mailing list Facebook",1
4-year old Russian girl speaks 7 languages. How did she do this?,"education , children , RBTH Daily Bella Devyatkina Source: Rossia One TV Channel 
Earlier this month Bella instantly became famous thanks to ""Amazing People,"" a show on the Russian television. The video with the girl answering questions, singing songs and talking about herself in different languages went viral. 
""Compared with this child, I feel like an idiot,"" users wrote in the comments section. 
Video by YouTube 
Yulia Devyatkina, Bella's mother, said her daughter is not a child prodigy; they just invested a lot of time and effort in her development. ""Not every child needs to speak six languages, but any kid can master two or three,"" the mother said. 
Bella's parents understand that their daughter will not be using all these languages in every day life. 
""When school starts we will focus on English, French and Chinese,"" the mother said. ""We also don't worry that Bella will not be interested in her classes. She has the same knowledge that any four-year-old child should have, but she is able to discuss these topics in different languages."" French baby talk 
Bella's mom is a linguist and has been teaching English to children for seven years. Her father works at the Radio Research and Development Institute based in Moscow. The family has an average income, but the parents decided that their daughter's development is their main priority. Italian polyglot: ‘To understand Russians you must speak Russian’ 
Initially, the parents wanted Bella to speak English like a native speaker, and the mother spoke with Bella in English and Russian from birth, alternating every other day. She made sure that the languages were not mixed, not allowing the girl to insert Russian words during a conversation in English. 
When Bella was 10-month-old, her parents added French. She could not talk but could point her finger at things when adults referred to them. Bella mastered reading even before she began to talk, and her parents taught this using special cards from the age of five months. For example, when ten-month-old Bella was shown the word ""hand"" written in Russian or English, she showed her little hand. By the age of one, she and her parents mastered 60 such cards. Bella began to read easily at the age of two. Chinese cartoons 
By the age of two Bella learned to speak in short sentences and read fluently in three languages. When she was just under three, her parents added Chinese to her program. According to the mother, Bella showed great interest in the new language, and she asked to watch cartoons in Chinese. 
At the age of three years and two months, little Bella showed an interest in learning Spanish and German, as well as dancing, violin and vocals. Then Arabic was also added. Bella walks, plays hide and seek, and reads ordinary books for children – she just does it in different languages. All her classes are held in the form of a game. 
The parents organize small educational excursions with native speakers for Bella, she also attends an English theater club, studies drawing in French, dancing in Spanish, and attends figure skating lessons with a native German speaker. In addition, the parents regularly organize joint language classes for Bella and her friends who are also brought up in a multilingual environment. Brain power 
Scientists confirm that the ability to speak in different languages, and switch from one to the other, depends on the interaction of different areas of the brain. They are activated depending on the language's phonetic characteristics, its grammatical system, imagery and even tonality. 
""Every new experience is reflected in the brain by the emergence of new nerve connections,"" said psychologist Tatyana Dyachenko. ""The hippocampus, responsible for memory, stimulates the growth of new neurons. The volume of certain parts of the brain literally grows.'' 
""Multilingualism has a positive effect on a child's overall development, though it may cause a lag in the development of speech at an early stage in comparison with children who grow up with only one language,"" said Kira Ivanova, an expert at the Institute of Linguistic Studies (ILS) in the Russian Academy of Sciences. 
Early training, however, does not guarantee that the child will be fluent in the language in the future. 
""I know one mom who spoke with her child only in English until he was three,"" said Maria Molina, a researcher at the ILS.

Russia to test new anti-tank guided missiles in Syria,"RBTH Daily , syria , aviation , missiles Ka-52K attack helicopters. Source: Yuri Smityuk / TASS 
Ka-52K attack helicopters deployed on the Admiral Kuznetsov aircraft carrier will test-fire test the latest Hermes extreme-range anti-tank guided missiles for the first time in Syria in the battle with Islamic State, the daily newspaper Izvestiya has reported . 
""Tests in a combat environment will help finalize the missile system, which should become a standard weapon for Russia's Alligator military helicopters,"" the newspaper said, citing a source in the Russian military-industrial complex. ""It was decided to test the Hermes in more difficult, shipborne air operations."" What is the Hermes and what is it for? 
According to Izvestiya, owing to the new weapon, the Ka-52K will be able to destroy enemy tanks, fortifications and manpower at a distance of 30 km (20 miles). The range of similar Russian and foreign systems (Ataka, Vikhr, Hellfire, and others) is less than 10 km. 
According to Viktor Litovkin, a retired colonel and military expert for the TASS news agency, the Hermes will be used to attack well-protected militant targets – arms and IED production facilities as well as command posts and temporary firing points. 
""Based on its combat use, it will be decided whether to send the system back for revision or to adopt it,"" said Litovkin. Features of the Hermes 
As experts interviewed by RBTH noted, the missile's key feature is the ability to track and destroy over-the-horizon targets. Due to its infrared homing and laser guidance capabilities, it can hit enemy armored vehicles autonomously, even if they are out of sight of the helicopter crew. 
""Similar tactical tasks can be performed by Israel's Spike-NLOS system, which is mounted on a wheeled chassis. However, Russia's Hermes can be deployed on ground tracked vehicles as well as on helicopters and ships. Ours is more universal,"" a source in the Russian Defense Ministry said in an interview with RBTH. Defense Minister: Russian arms pass Syria test, but there are problems 
According to the source, the official data on the missile will be provided after its adoption. 
""Now we can only say that its range is much greater than that of foreign anti-tank systems, the farthest of which hits targets 10 km away,"" said the RBTH source. 
He added that the missile can be equipped with either a cumulative or high-explosive warhead. The shipborne Ka-52 
The Ka-52 Katran attack helicopters were created for the French Mistral-class amphibious assault ships. 
However, according to Vadim Kozyulina, a professor of the Academy of Military Science, Francois Hollande had to terminate the contract for the supply of the ships to Russia under pressure from NATO allies. Eventually, the Mistrals were acquired by Egypt, and immediately thereafter Cairo purchased a batch of 50 Russian Katrans from Moscow. 
It was decided to deploy the remaining helicopters on the Admiral Kuznetsov aircraft carrier, and they will have their ""baptism of fire"" at the end of the year. 
As Kozyulina noted, the ""ground"" version of the Ka-52 has proved to be successful in the Syrian campaign. The new machines will also have to demonstrate their combat potential to future buyers.

The Ossetians: From nomads and warriors to the artists of the Caucasus,"people , regions , caucasus , folk , culture Young residents of Dzuarikau village performing a dance at a folklore concert. Republic of Northern Ossetia-Ala, Russia. Source: Yakov Berliner/RIA Novosti 
For Alik Pagayev, an Ossetian who manages a troupe at the Narty Theater in Vladikavkaz, creativity is in the blood of his people. 
”I was born in a mountain village and we had this joke: 'Throw a balalaika out of your window, anyone who catches it can play it,” he says. 
Vladikavkaz, the capital of North Ossetia, a small republic on Russia’s southern edge bordering Georgia, is called the “Caucasian St. Petersburg.” No other city in the North Caucasus has so many creative people: artists, photographers, designers and performers. 
Creative abilities, however, are not the only national trait of the Ossetians. Pagayev says that every Ossetian has military skills and talents for working with horses in their blood.

The Ossetians are descended from Iranian-speaking nomads – the Scythians and the Sarmatians. In historical writings from the 2nd century A.D. these tribes were known for their serious military and political might. 
By the 11th century A.D. the medieval kingdom of Alania had been established in the region. Its inhabitants were famous for their military skills: The main army consisted of the cavalry. Despite their glorious reputation, the Alans could not fight off the Tatar-Mongolian invasion and in the 14th century they were practically destroyed as a people. Only few hundred Alans remained in the mountains. However, the nation managed to survive and later it successfully assimilated in Russia. 
According to a 2010 census, today there are almost 700,000 Ossetians in the world, most of whom live in Russia. Most Ossetians live in North Ossetia (459,600 people), while in Moscow there are 7,900 Ossetians and in St. Petersburg slightly over 3,000. 
While 45,900 Ossetians live in the disputed territory of South Ossetia (recognized by just three nations, with the rest of the world continuing to see it as part of Georgia), they also live in Russia’s other Caucasian republics. In Kabardino-Balkaria there are more than 9,000 Ossetians, in the Stavropol Territory there are almost 8,000 and there is even a separate Ossetian village in Karachay-Cherkessia with 3,100 inhabitants. There are also Ossetian diasporas in other countries. In Turkey the fraternity counts 37,000 members and in Georgia – 14,300 outside South Ossetia. 
”The Caucasus started to become a part of Russia in the 18th century. Our republic was one of the first,” explains Anna Kabisova, a photographer and photojournalist. 
”The Ossetians are Christians. So it is easier for them, in comparison to the Muslim republics, to find common ground with the Russian population.” Source: Archive photo, 19th century 
”The Ossetians perceived these changes as a salvation since it is difficult to survive in the mountains and the intelligentsia understood that it was important to develop. A step towards Russia implied opportunity. Back then many Ossetians went to study in St. Petersburg. That is how this place acquired many artists, sculptors and then its own influential art school, its own distinguishing style,” she said. 
In her view, such open-mindedness to new cultures is also a national trait. ”The reason lies in religion. The Ossetians are Christians. So it is easier for them, in comparison to the Muslim republics, to find common ground with the Russian population.” Pies, beer and offerings to the gods 
Actually, the Christianity found in the republic is not entirely traditional. Pagan beliefs are also strong here. The Ossetians have dozens of popular religious celebrations with various rituals. There are symbolic peace sacrifices, for example, slaughtering a chicken or a sheep for guests at a feast. 
The famous Ossetian national pies are sacred food. These round, thin pies with meat, cheese and potatoes in the Ossetian worldview represent the sun. During a holiday each family places three pies on the table. They also have local breweries. 
”The Caucasus started to become a part of Russia in the 18th century. Our republic was one of the first,” explains Anna Kabisova, a photographer and photojournalist. Anna Kabisova 
For many occasions women brew beer according to the national recipe. The Ossetians have their own Oktoberfest. Each October Vladikavkaz holds an Ossetian beer festival/competition, to which Ossetians come from Russia and other countries. The drink, in its aspect and taste, is similar to kvas , the Russian malt drink, and is around 1.5-2 percent alcohol. 
The beer is brewed in a large cauldron over a fire. Its main ingredients are the typical ones: hops, malt. But there are also special ones such as lamb ribs and sugar – there are many different recipes. Not merchants 
”Ask me what I hate doing most and I'll respond: trading,” says Alik Pagayev, describing the national character. ""The Ossetians don't have an entrepreneurial spirit. We have many talented artists, good athletes, especially in freestyle wrestling, horse breeders, but commerce is really not our thing.” 
”Ask me what I hate doing most and I'll respond: trading,” says Alik Pagayev, describing the national character. Source: Archive photo, 19th century 
Pagayev also says that tolerance and tact are two other national traits. 
”I worked in [the neighboring republic of] Kabardino-Balkaria for three years and could not get used to the fact that they speak their national language. I would go to someone's house and they would speak their own language. I wouldn't understand anything and someone would have to translate the general meaning of the conversation. 
”In Ossetia it's not like that. If there’s even one guest among us, we speak Russian. A friend of mine from Chechnya would often visit us and once he heard people speaking Ossetian on a street in Vladikavkaz. He was surprised because he had thought that we always speak Russian.”

In fact, Pagayev explains, there are some young people who do not even know their national language, which he says is sad. 
”Our language must be preserved. At home my children speak only Ossetian. If I hear them speak Russian, I tell them, 'You'll speak Russian where you have to, but at home speak your native language,'” he says. 
Another important national trait is learning, he explains: ”People always wonder: A young guy from a remote mountain village goes to study in St. Petersburg or Moscow and in two years he fully integrates, speaks Russian without an accent and produces good results in his studies. This is an important trait. I think this is what helped our people survive the difficult times.” Subscribe to get the hand picked best stories every week Subscribe to our mailing list Facebook",1
Is it necessary to break the law to improve your standard of living?,"law , economy , society , standard of living , RBTH Daily The study assessed attitudes about non-violent legal violations, such as working ""off the books"" or not officially registering a business. Source: Vyacheslav Prokofyev/TASS 
Thirty percent of Russians believe that they can increase revenues or improve their standard of living only by violating the law, a recent survey carried out by RANEPA's Center for Socio-Political Monitoring found. ""Alarming symptom"" 
Respondents' agreement with this point of view depends on their economic well-being, experts say. The worse their financial situation, the more they believe they need to break the law to become wealthier. For example, 52 percent of respondents with low incomes feel this way. U.S. asked to join probe into Russian anti-corruption official 
The study assessed attitudes about non-violent legal violations, such as working ""off the books"" or not officially registering a business, the Center's director Andrei Pokida told RBC. The survey was conducted by personal interviews with 1,600 people from 35 regions. 
""This is an alarming symptom, as citizens' attitudes toward the shadow economy and their willingness to engage in this process can be observed against the background of a gradual decline in real incomes of the population,"" the researchers state. The average income of Russians has decreased by 6.1 percent during the past last year, a record decline since 1999. Almost half of Russians justify the shadow economy 
Experts found that working people have a ""very approving"" attitude towards various forms of the shadow economy. 
While only 7.2 percent of respondents believe that it does more benefit than harm, 34.5 percent of respondents believe the shadow economy is more beneficial than harmful, and 38.3 percent are inclined to think that it brings both benefit and harm equally; the rest found it difficult to reply. These statistics imply that about 45 percent of the employed population of Russia justify the informal economy. Russian official received a bribe of 2 bags of Whiskas 
Compared to previous survey results, the number of people who clearly approve of the informal economy decreased, down from 10.5 percent in 2013. However, the proportion of those who were neutral slightly increased, up from 33.2 percent. But Russians were even more tolerant of the shadow economy in 1990: 49.5 percent were convinced that it brought both benefit and harm, 21 percent supported it and only 13.5 percent opposed it. 
Over the subsequent 11 years, though, attitudes changed dramatically. In 2001, the number who supported the informal economy dropped to a historic low of 2.1 percent, while those opposing it increased to 49 percent; 26.7 percent remained neutral. 
According to RANEPA's June estimates, about 30 million people are engaged in Russia's shadow labor market, or 40.3 percent of the economically active population. Of these, 8.7 million people (11.7 percent) are completely excluded from the official workforce, while the remaining receive a portion of their salary ""under the table"" or have additional unreported earnings.",1

”Terveh,” I saluted a lady in her seventies while walking along the lanes of the village of Vedlozero, in the Republic of Karelia, Russia. I knew that according to statistics, one third of the inhabitants of the village spoke Karelian, a closely relative language to my native Finnish. So I was greeting passers-by in the village in Karelian in order to find out how the situation was in reality and which kind of people still spoke the language. 
”Please come inside and have Karelian pies,” answered the lady with a friendly voice, in Karelian of course. I went inside, sat at the table, ate freshly baked melting Karelian pies, drank tea and chatted with the lady and her husband. Karelians: Life on the border between cultures 
We talked together in mixed Baltic-Finnic: me in Finnish, and my hosts in Karelian. They talked about their offspring, about their children who live in bigger cities and speak Karelian too, and about their grandchildren, who speak only Russian. 
My hosts told me about their plantations and their life in the village, which is to a large extent self-sufficient. I saw their milk-producing goats, green cucumbers, red tomatoes and large potato fields. It is impressive what they are able to prepare from their natural resources. The Finland that once was 
I walked back to the house that belonged to my real hosts, the parents of a friend of mine. On my way there I had a look at the white birches and especially the rowan trees, which are sacred trees for ancient Finns. I realized that lakes and fauna in the village express clearly that Finland is a part of the same continuum extending through all northern Russia until the Ural Mountains. 
The Russian countryside reminded me of the Finnish countryside that does not exist anymore. By seeing cows and goats walking along the lanes of the village I got an image of what life was like in my grandmothers’ childhood in Finland. A photographic journey around Karelia in fall 
I saw neighbors helping each other and grandchildren spending their summer days at their grandparents’ place. I enjoyed dinner together with my hosts. This taught me something about Russian hospitality and mutual solidarity, about the warmth with which they treat their guests. 
The parents of a friend of mine offered me pickled cucumbers, sausages, olivier salad, different pies and sour cream, and made me feel relaxed and welcome. We talked about the trip to the lake we had made the day before; how we had caught fish and had lunch on the sands along the shore of the lake. 
Steaming sauna baths and vodka enjoyed with good company became etched in my mind as a symbol of Russian comradeship. The most important and interesting discussions between true friends in Russia, I learned, are debated in the sauna, or alternatively, in front of the vodka bottle in the small hours. Russia and the village 
I started to realize, similarly to many Russian writers and social thinkers of the 19th century, the significance of the rural atmosphere to the russkaya dusha (Russian soul). A village community such as Vedlozero reflects for me the Russian soul, the solidarity of people in their community and their hospitality. 
On the point of leaving Vedlozero, Anni, an old Karelian-speaking lady, said goodbye in a heart-warming Orthodox style. “Jumalanke”– let God be with you – she wished me from the bottom of her heart. I suddenly realized that at this very moment the lady had unveiled the true face of Russia to me.

The exercise involved MiG-29, MiG-31 and Su-27 fighters, Su-24 and Su-34 tactical bombers, Su-25 attack bombers and Mi-8 and Ka-27 helicopters. The Russian Airspace Forces' Tu-160 and Tu-95MS strategic missile-carrying bombers and Tu-22M3 long-range bombers posed as imaginary enemy targets. 
The exercise was led by the head of the Russian air force, Colonel-General Viktor Bondarev. Exercise against hijacking 
The exercise was pre-planned and had nothing to do with the current military-political situation, said Lieutenant-General Aitech Bizhev, former Deputy Commander of the Air Force for the CIS. Controlling the airwaves: Russia's electronic warfare systems 
Usually, the CIS air-defense forces practice executing scenarios involving the use of patrol forces against aircraft that violate the CIS borders, as well as in the case of hijacking of aircraft, in helping the crews of aircraft and helicopters in distress, said Bizhev. 
""In the summer, these exercises develop into tactical live-fire exercises on the Ashuluk firing range in the Astrakhan Region,"" he added. ""This is the so-called practical stage of the international exercises of the CIS Joint Air Defense System, 'Combat Commonwealth'."" Soviet reunion 
The recent exercise primarily involved command bodies from the Central Command Post to command posts of anti-aircraft missile battalions and individual radar companies' control points. 
""By and large, such exercises involve all the air defense troops of the former Soviet Union, of course, severely truncated compared with the 1980s,"" said Bizhev. 
The most important element of the exercise was the practicing of interoperability when aircraft cross the state borders of the CIS Joint Air Defense System members, as well as the movement of forces and equipment to the forward-based airfields, explained Colonel Sergei Volkov, former chairman of the Russian Air Defense Forces' Scientific and Technical Committee. Who are the members of the CIS Joint Air Defense System? 
The CIS Joint Air Defense System was established based on an agreement between 10 member countries, signed on Feb. 10, 1995 in Alma-Ata. Initially it included Armenia, Belarus, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Russia, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, Ukraine and Uzbekistan. Azerbaijan, Georgia and Moldova later left the organization.

In 1997, Turkmenistan effectively withdrew from the CIS Joint Air Defense System, while Uzbekistan cooperates with Russia exclusively on a bilateral basis. All relations in the sphere of defense with Ukraine were terminated after February 2014 over Russia’s seizure of Crimea and support for rebels in the Donbass region. 
According to Volkov, the joint air defense system helps create a more cost-effective duty roster and military personnel training. In addition, according to him, the use of neighboring countries' airfields can dramatically increase the range of fighter aircraft.",1

Ra-Ra-Rasputin: Russia’s famous love machine gets new biography this fall,"history , literature , romanov dinasty 
Grigori Yefimovich Rasputin (1869 – 30 December 1916) Russian peasant, mystical faith healer and private adviser to the Romanovs. Source: Photoshot / Vostok-Photo 
One hundred years ago, in December 1916, Grigory Rasputin was murdered at the home of Felix Yusupov and his body dumped in the river. Over the intervening century, the story of his unexpected rise and dramatic death has been retold so many times it is now the stuff of legend. Yusupov, during the hideous and prolonged murder, became convinced that Rasputin was “the reincarnation of Satan himself”. But a new biography by award-winning historian Douglas Smith examines the man behind the myth. Dark Fairy Tale Douglas Smith – Rasputin (Macmillan/Farrar, Straus and Giroux, Nov. 2016). Source: macmillan.com 
Rasputin remains fixed oxymoronically in the public imagination, Smith observes, as “mad monk” or “holy devil”. His life, one of the most remarkable in modern history, “reads like a dark fairy tale”: an uneducated peasant from deepest Siberia feels called by God to set off on adventures, bewitches the royal family, saves the prince’s life, gets too powerful, and is murdered by the great men of the realm. 
“He lived in legend, he died in legend and his memory is cloaked in legend,” wrote the brilliant satirist Nadezhda Lokhvitskaya, known by her penname Teffi, in a fabulously intimate 1924 essay on Rasputin. The piece is one of many gems in a new book of non-fiction, the first ever in English, by Teffi, famous for her sparkling short stories. 
The new collection is published in the UK as Rasputin and Other Ironies and in the US as Tolstoy, Rasputin, Others, and Me. Anne Marie Jackson has collaborated with Robert Chandler and other translators again to produce a glowing volume of Teffi’s prose, and her version of this essay is both funny and forceful. Teffi describes her encounters with Rasputin and his mythological status: “This man was unique, one of a kind, like a character out of a novel,” she wrote, reveling in Rasputin’s paradoxes: semi-literate peasant and yet counselor to the Tsar? Lustful satyr or saint? “How could anyone not be curious?” 'The End of Russia' 
Rasputin’s warning to Teffi: “if they kill Rasputin, it will be the end of Russia. They’ll bury us together” proved chillingly prophetic. Recalling dinner parties with Rasputin, Teffi says she sensed an inner discomfort under his obstinate, hypnotic exterior, that “howling inside him was a black beast.” His political power was undeniable: “He toppled ministers and he shuffled courtiers as if they were a pack of cards.” But after the revolution, she remembered “that black, bent terrible sorcerer”. And, as Smith puts it, his death plunged the whole country into “unspeakable bloodletting and misery.” Unimpressed by Rasputin: A witty female voice in a male-dominated sphere Years after meeting him, Teffi gave Rasputin’s autograph to one of his earliest biographers, J.W. Bienstock, whose book was reissued last year in the original French, along with other new biographies, including Frances Welch’s Short Life. Smith’s contrastingly capacious tome measures out a chronological account compiled from archives now scattered across the world. Rasputin includes some extraordinary incidents: tales of friendship and betrayal, scandals, mysteries, miracles, and letters written in blood. He devotes a chapter to Teffi’s account, confirming Rasputin’s love of wine, women and dance.
As for his legendary status as “Russia’s greatest love machine”, Smith records that while talk of frenzied orgies and scores of ravaged maidens was fanciful, it is beyond doubt that he had lovers. Even Rasputin’s daughter, Maria, a defender of her father’s legacy conceded that: “Surrounded by women as he was, a man of natural instincts, robust and virile, he may certainly have yielded to many temptations.” The myth continues 
At the same time, paradoxically, Rasputin’s myth had a number of religious guises: as a member of the secret khlystian sect, a pilgrim, prophet or religious elder. It is this heady mix of cult rituals, mesmeric powers and sexual perversion that has fuelled Rasputin’s persistent legend. The same myths have generally deterred serious academics, who – in Smith’s words – saw Rasputin as “too popular, too well-known outside the university to be taken seriously. He had the whiff of the carnival about him, a figure better left to writers of fiction or pop history.” His is perhaps the most recognized name in Russian history, says Smith, citing legions of previous biographies, together with novels, films and songs, like Boney M’s 1978 Euro-disco hit about the “lover of the Russian queen.”

The myth continues to spawn bars and nightclubs, ice dances and brands of vodka, while Rasputin remains “practically invisible under all the gossip, slander, and innuendo”. Smith has undertaken an “unusually arduous” search for the truth. In extricating the man from his own mythography, Smith found that Rasputin’s story becoming “the story of Russia itself”. His turbulent biography is a fascinating lens through which to view the “twilight of tsarist Russia” and the violent history of the early 20th century.

Moscow is calling for a thorough investigation of the attack on a school in the Syrian province of Idlib and other incidents, Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov said after meeting with his Syrian counterpart, Walid Muallem, and Iran’s top diplomat Javad Zarif. 
""The Idlib school attack has been very much hyped lately,"" the Russian minister said. ""The allegations particularly lay the blame on Russia and Syria. We are being accused of delivering the airstrikes that hit the school. In response to these assertions, Russia’s Defense Ministry has shared some facts that disprove the accusations and show that this media hype has been biased."" 
""I would also like to mention that on the same day a mine hit a school in western Aleppo and at the same time, militants from eastern Aleppo shelled a humanitarian corridor set up near that school,"" the minister continued. ""As a result, 12 civilians were killed and 20 wounded. It is impossible to distort this information. Our journalists have visited this area and recorded this absolutely inhuman crime that the insurgents active in eastern Aleppo had committed."" 
All these incidents need to be thoroughly investigated, the Russian top diplomat stressed. 
At the same time, Lavrov noted that ""Russia and Iran welcome the Syrian government’s readiness to enhance cooperation with the UN in tackling humanitarian issues, that was confirmed today"". ""We believe that the UN representatives should act impartially, and refrain from responding to provocations,"" the Russian minister emphasized.",1

Number of the week: How long until Russia can end its oil dependence?,"By RBTH Yevgeny Biyatov / RIA Novosti 
The Russian economy will need at least 10 years to end its oil dependence, according to a statement made by the head of Sberbank, German Gref. 
""A very large amount of today's GDP is based on oil and gas,” he said at a Sberbank conference on Oct. 28. “And it takes time to create an economy with half of the existing digital businesses, to digitize traditional forms of business. I think it will be at least 5 or even 10 years,"" he said.",1
Russians deride choice of confusing 2018 World Cup mascot Zabivaka | Russia Beyond The Headlines,"sport , 2018 world cup , RBTH Daily ""I must say that Zabivaka the wolf has been my mascot at university and at work for the last 15 years. I'm happy that now he will help Russian sport!"" Photo: The official mascot of the FIFA World Cup 2018 Wolf Zabivaka. Source: TASS 
Russians have voted for the mascot for the 2018 FIFA World Cup, with the winner being declared 
a wolf called Zabivaka, who wears the national tricolor and goggles and swings his paw at the ball. He will soon appear on all soccer and soccer-related paraphernalia and merchandise for the upcoming tournament. 
The other finalists were a tiger and a cat, but popular opinion was not in their favor and the wolf ran off with 53 percent of the votes (the tiger cosmonaut received 27 percent and the cat 20 percent). 
A total of 50,000 participants and their mascots – from an Amur Tiger to an alien – battled for victory. However, in the end Russians decided that an animal that howls at the moon suits them best. For some the wolf is associated with speed and assertiveness, for others the chimerical chances of the national team winning the cup. 
However, the new mascot has opened something of a Pandora's box. Following the popular vote, the Russian internet has been inundated with quibbles and for several days Zabivaka was beset with unflattering comparisons from social network users who mocked the mascot's physical appearance and name. Goalscorer, hooligan or loafer? 
""Yesterday they decided to play a joke: They proposed to call the mascot Zabivaka. And the people? The people accepted it,"" joked a tweet on the official Kontinental Hockey League Twitter account . 
Many internet users noticed the ambiguity of the name – the verb zabivat in Russian can mean either to score (a goal) or to strike. This was ironic since former Sports Minister Vitaly Mutko said that the name was just supposed to translate well and be original (for patenting purposes). Bear necessity: Designing a mascot for the 1980 Moscow Olympics 
""Something tells me that Zabivaka, written with Latin letters, does not make its etymology and meaning any easier for our English-language friends,"" wrote Twitter user @Bobchensk. 
However, social network users remembered that football inspires some to strike not only the ball: The photographs of aggressive football fans in Marseilles, France during the 2016 European Championship, when the Russian national team was almost expelled from the tournament, appeared all over the internet once again, while others showed Zabivaka among thugs attacking their victims. 
Another unfortunate association with the infinitive zabivat is the related construction zabit na , which means to be indifferent, or not to care. Social network users took advantage of this opportunity to make fun of the woeful results of the Russian national team in recent years. Here the poor wolf really took a beating. ""Football and the Russian lifestyle,"" wrote @ntnet, while @SashaBo4alova noted that the best Zabivaka in Russian football is not a wolf but “a loafer.” 
""I must say that Zabivaka the wolf has been my mascot at university and at work for the last 15 years. I'm happy that now he will help Russian sport!"" wrote Facebook user Sergei Fokin on his page. A cheap wolf 
The wolf's appearance also raised some issues. The main problem was addressed by @Maxi_Sar: ""Why the hell does the wolf need damned winter goggles if it’s a football world cup?!"" 
RBTH posed this question to the creator of the new World Cup mascot Yekaterina Bocharova, a 21-year-old graphic design student at Tomsk State University. 
""These are not winter goggles but just sports goggles, like the ones you use for cycling. It's just that Zabivaka is so fast on the field that he needs eye protection,"" she replied, adding that the goggles were also high-tech, for precise passes and strikes. Cheburashka: Fun facts about Russia's iconic furry character 
Bocharova said that she was always fascinated by Disney cartoons, that she dreams of working for this company and loves the animated film Ratatouille . Incredibly, FIFA paid her just $500 for the rights to the drawing. 
Journalists remarked (in Russian) that this was a tiny amount, noting that previous mascots cost much more. For example, the symbol of the Brazilian World Cup was Fuleko the armadillo and FIFA paid $100 million for his rights. The 1998 World Cup mascot Footix the rooster cost FIFA $30 million. 
FIFA then earns revenues from using the mascots on souvenir products. Footix brought the organization $27 million, while Zakumi the leopard, the mascot for the 2010 World Cup in South Africa, earned FIFA $71 million. 
But Bocharova has no issues with her compensation. She says that FIFA gave her ""a lot more,"" and it has nothing to do with money. 
""All these positive feelings and meetings with amazing people. I think money can't buy all that,"" she said, implying her meetings with the Tomsk governor and the popular TV host Ivan Urgant, who invited Bocharova onto his talk show in Moscow. ""I would have not achieved all this without them. I am very happy and grateful for all this,"" she said.

Indian counter-terror experience useful for Russia,"terrorism , india , russia Opinion Indian Army soldiers leave the site of a gun battle in Pampore, on the outskirts of Srinagar, Kashmir. Source:AP 
The Indian experience in fighting against terrorism can be useful for Russia, while the Western experience is narrowly focused. Cooperation with New Delhi on this issue, therefore, is more important than such a dialogue with the West, said Yuri Nagernyak, General Director of “Humanism, Progress and the Rule of Law” Fund, an international foundation for the promotion of culture, science and education. 
“I think that the Indian direction, in terms of fighting against terrorism in Russia, is extremely important, and I dare say, more important than trying to organize such cooperation with Western countries,” he said during a Moscow-Delhi video bridge, organized by the MIA Russia Today. 
Nagernyak said Russia and India were connected by “deep interests”, and a common vision of the future, which make them “close partners”. 
Kadakin: Russia with India. Terrorism is greatest human rights violation 
Thus, “relations between the two countries, regardless of how the political situation develops, always remain at the highest level,” he explained. 
“In this sense, in cooperating with India, in terms of the fight against terrorism, we can, firstly, be sure that this cooperation will be real, and not merely declarative. Secondly, we can be confident in the stability of this cooperation. Third, and much more important, it seems to me, exchanges between our two countries will give us much more than cooperation in this sphere between Russia and the West,” believes Nagernyak. 
The reason for this, he said, is particularly because India is faced with different directions of terrorism. 
“The Indian experience in counter-terrorism , and terrorism in many of its different forms, is really beneficial to Russia, while the experience of the West – is actually a very narrow experience,” said Nagernyak. 
Andrey Kazantsev, Director of the Analytical Centre of the Institute of International Studies, MGIMO (University) MFA Russia, also noted that, “for Russia and India there exists a common interest in stabilizing the situation in such a wide region that includes Afghanistan, Pakistan and Central Asia”. He believes “different formats of Russian-Indian dialogue need to be developed on this aspect of cooperation.”

"More beer, less vodka as Russians mull ongoing crisis","vodka , beer , russians Visitors at the bar ""Aist"" (Stork) on Lubyansky Proyezd in Moscow Source:Alexey Kudenko / RIA Novosti 
The volume of retail trade turnover in Russia continues to decrease. In August, it fell by 0.1 percent compared to the previous month, compared to January-August last year, when it fell by 5.7 per cent, said analysts from the Russian Presidential Academy of National Economy and Public Administration (RANEPA). They were citing data from the state statistical agency Rosstat and a survey conducted by the Institute for Social Analysis and Forecasting. 
The turnover is decreasing because Russians are not only eating less and cutting back on spending on services, but they are also drinking fewer alcoholic beverages. Sales of vodka dropped catastrophically’ 
From January to August 2016, vodka, liqueurs and brandies accounted for 42 percent of sales volume. Beer amounted to 44-45 percent of total sales of alcohol. Another 12-13 percent was wine production. 
Other beverages (cider, mead, etc.) made up less than 1 percent of alcohol products bought by people, according to RANEPA's monitoring data. 
Whiskey or vodka: Which drink will dominate? 
The range of sales is clearly seasonal. Retailers usually sell more wine, champagne and vodka in December while sales of beer increase by 15-20 percent in mid-summer compared to the beginning of the year. 
""Retail sales of alcohol have significantly decreased over the past two years. 10.6 percent fewer alcoholic beverages were sold between January and August this year than during the same eight months of 2014,"" the survey report stated. Retail sales of alcoholic beverages bottomed out in January and April 2016. 
""Sales of vodka have dropped catastrophically,"" Alexandra Burdyak, a senior researcher at RANEPA and one of the authors of the study, said. ""The drop was 13.4 percent against the same period of last year. The main decline occurred last year, when sales of vodka decreased by 12.6 percent compared to 2014."" 
However, the wine production sector showed a different trend. The traditional New Year increase in sales of wine and champagne dragged on, with wine sales remaining at 2015 levels until May 2016. 
Burdyak said consumers first finished their earlier stored wine and then, as stocks in cabinets dried out, and lovers of wine and sparkling wines made sure that nothing was happening in the economy, the ruble was not strengthening and the prices of imported alcohol were not decreasing, they began to buy this type of alcohol again. The new generation of consumers 
According to Burdyak, the decrease in consumption of vodka and other alcoholic beverages has been steady since 2013. Strong alcohol consumption peaked in 2007, and it has been in decline since then. 
The taste of Russians, born in 1985 and later, has been shaped by western, primarily European influences; they prefer wine, beer and other light alcoholic beverages. 
However, Vadim Drobiz, director of the Centre for Federal and Regional Alcohol Market Studies (TSIFRRA), believes it is a little too early to talk about a reduction in alcohol consumption in Russia. 
""Because of the crisis, the main consumers of alcoholic drinks could have switched to cheaper options, this is possible,"" he said. ""But few people are capable of seriously saving on alcohol."" 
Despite falling production, vodka consumption increasing in Russia Drinking away the crisis 
Vodka consumption fell from 53 percent of retail sales, measured in terms of absolute alcohol content, in 2007-2009 to 39 percent in 2015. During the same period, the share of beer increased from 31-32 percent to 43 percent of total sales of alcoholic beverages. 
The total volume of retail sales is calculated in terms of absolute alcohol content as follows: Half a litre of vodka (40 percent alcohol) is equal to 200 grams of ethanol; one litre of beer (4 percent) is equivalent to 40 grams, and one litre of wine (12 percent) contains 120 grams of ethanol. 
These trends appear likely to continue over the next few years, though some analysts have reservations. 
""It should be borne in mind that consumers, and the Russians certainly in my experience, consider strong alcohol to be an antidepressant,"" Drobiz said. ""And that means that consumption of vodka and other spirits in the context of the ongoing economic crisis is not likely to fall.""

People in Damascus ‘have fear in their eyes’: Filmmaker,"syria , cinema , movies Russian filmmaker Maria Ivanova. Source: Elena Kern / press-photo 
Where did you find the courage to go to the Middle East to make a film on migrants? 
Maria Ivanova: I began making my film in Berlin, in a camp for refugees. I was searching for a female protagonist. But when I arrived, I was told that girls do not flee Syria alone, only with their husbands or relatives. 
In the end I visually began ""capturing"" interesting faces. I found my protagonist – 14-year-old Muhammad, who was sent by his parents to Germany alone. He did the whole journey alone so that later, he could get his relatives out of Syria through the legal process of family reunification. 
During the shooting I understood that I needed to go to Damascus, where this boy's parents stayed. Because of the hassle in obtaining a Syrian visa my cameraman and I travelled to Syria through Beirut. In Lebanon you don't need a visa. 
U.S. needs Russia in Syria: Russian analysts 
As we were driving along the road I knew that ISIS was only 10 kilometres [6 miles] away, very near. We were driving incredibly fast, at 200 kilometres per hour, when the driver saw a motorcycle coming. So our car quickly turned around and headed in the opposite direction. “Why?” I asked the driver later. Because terrorists often drive around at night on motorcycles, he said. 
That’s how we got to Damascus. There was no heating in the apartment we were taken to. No electricity and hot water. We slept on something similar to a couch. There are no real beds there. And at three in the morning, I heard bombing. 
Is all of Damascus in this state? 
M.I.: I was in the south and there it was frightening to walk out on the street. People have fear in their eyes, the atmosphere is very heavy. 
Did you meet the parents of your protagonist Muhammad? How did you contact them? 
M.I.: They welcomed us with open arms. They fed us. They have all means of communication, they use social networks. After meeting with them we returned to Beirut and went to the refugee camps in Lebanon's mountains, filming there for two weeks. 
Were the Lebanese camps different from the German ones? 
M.I.: Of course. Lebanon doesn’t have special conditions. There’s a character in our film, a man who has 17 children. He lives in a tent that he has divided into several parts. He patches up the holes. They all sleep on the floor. Despite their horrible position, these people offered us food and played the oud [an Arabian musical instrument – RIR] for us. They joked… Their life is based on the hope that they will return home. Of course, many want to go to Europe. They fill out applications. But Europe does not accept everyone. 
Lebanon is an unusual country. Just think, there are 18 religious confessions on a territory that is smaller than the Moscow Region. There are four million residents and one and a half million Syrian refugees. And yet, I never saw a conflict between, say, Christians and Muslims. They all go to the same restaurants, the same movie theatres, everyone is friendly. 
Which films are you taking to the festival in Lebanon? 
M.I.: We finished this documentary film just a few days ago and I decided to hold the premiere in Lebanon, where we shot most of the material. Moreover, our partner, the TV channel RT, is producing two documentary films: Women against ISIS and Sector of Contradiction . The directors of these films are coming to answer questions and hold master classes. 
How much is Russian culture present in Lebanon? Do people speak Russian there? 
M.I.: Many Lebanese studied in the Soviet Union. There is even an association of Soviet university graduates. These people speak Russian, many even married Russian citizens. Furthermore, there are 30,000 Russians living there. There are Lebanese who attend classes and study Russian. Sure, you mostly hear Arabic, English and French. Russian culture is not well known. So we sort of filled a vacuum. 
A common film market for Russia, India and China? 
Is the war in the neighbouring country felt in Lebanon? 
M.I.: You still feel the previous war, the civil war. There are buildings scarred by bombings. There are many military personnel, roadblocks, armoured personnel carriers, patrols. But next to a destroyed building you can find a modern art gallery, which is followed by soldiers again, and then a modern theatre. This is a patchwork country, it is very heterogeneous. 
Once I was at the Sarajevo Film Festival, which had a really heavy atmosphere. There were no stadiums there. They had turned into cemeteries since there was no space for burying people. While in Lebanon you feel very light. You want to live, despite certain moments… The presence of soldiers, on the contrary, creates the feeling of security. 
I travelled there by car with a driver, saw beautiful cities, mountains, wine production. I went to an apple festival. I wasn’t afraid. The country has a modern airport, taxis, hotels, wonderful restaurants, beaches and movie theatres. The thing is that no one anywhere will give you 100-percent guaranteed security, including when you're driving through France or Germany. In terms of security, Lebanon is no different than Europe.

Russian scientists will track sea lions from space,"Russian scientists will track sea lions from space 28 October 2016 TASS The researchers succeeded in installing five GPS tags on two full-grown sea lionesses. Facebook science , research , russia 
Researchers at the Kamchatka branch of the Pacific Institute of Geography of Russia’s Science Academy’s Far East Department now have the opportunity to monitor Steller sea lions that are on Russia’s Red List of Threatened Species, from space, the Komandorsky Nature Reserve’s Spokesman Alexei Veledinsky told TASS on Friday. The researchers succeeded in installing five GPS tags on two full-grown sea lionesses and three cubs on the national park’s territory. 
""It was not an easy task as these animals are very timid. They had to be knocked out using tranquillizers so that they could be tagged,"" Veledinsky said. 
However, right after the animals woke up, scientists started receiving the data on their movement. In one case, a few days after being tagged, a sea lionesses and her cub travelled several hundred kilometers from the Commander Islands through the Pacific Ocean to Russia’s Kamchatka Peninsula. All of the sea lions’ movements are depicted on a map via a computer program. 
""Researchers will be able to follow the sea lions for approximately one year. The tags placed on the animals’ heads will fall off when they begin to shed their fur. That said, the tags are glued to their fur with a specific paste,"" Veledinsky explained. 
One of the main goals of this research is to garner scientific data on the winter habitats of the sea lions populating the Commander Islands as their number has been falling. In the 1960s and 1970s up to 12,000 sea lions used to spend the winter on the islands, while in summer there were 2,000 to 5,000 animals there. Now there are no more than 600 sea lions. The new data will enable the creation of more safe conditions in the sea lions’ rookeries. There are four rookeries where sea lionesses bear cubs on the Commander Islands, which is encompassed by the national park. Besides that, there are also three rookeries where cubs are not born. 
The Komandorsky Nature Reserve, founded in 1993, is the largest marine sanctuary in Russia with a territory of more than 3 mln hectares.

India and Russia have approved the proposal to double the range of the BrahMos, world’s first supersonic cruise missile at the 16th Russia-India intergovernmental commission on military cooperation meeting. 
FGFA may be armed with BrahMos cruise missiles 
Sources told Sputnik that during the annual summit in Goa, Russian President Vladimir Putin and Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi reached an agreement to develop different range of the BrahMos. 
One of the ranges agreed upon was to double it from current range of 300 km which received final nod on October 26 during the Russia-India intergovernmental commission on military cooperation meeting co-chaired by Indian Defence Minister Manohar Parrikar and his Russian counterpart Sergei Shoigu. 
“Russia is India's time tested and closest partner and it will continue to remain our primary defence partner,” Manohar Parrikar, Indian Defence Minister, said after the meeting on Wednesday. 
The proposal to increase the range of BrahMos was under consideration for a long time and now it is formalized after India became a member of Missile Technology Control Regime this year. It is said that only minor changes will be enough to extend the range of BrahMos up to 600 km. 
Why the BrahMos armed Sukhoi is bad news for India’s enemies 
Currently, BrahMos is capable of hitting targets beyond the radar horizon and can be launched from sea based and land based weapon systems. Test fire of an air-launched version of Brahmos cruise missile expected to be held in February next year. The 2.5 metric ton Brahmos air-to-ground missile will be fired from an IAF (Indian Air Force) Sukhoi-30 MKI fighter aircraft that has undergone modifications to accommodate the new weapon. A successful preliminary trial has already been carried out, and two more dummy trials are in the pipeline before the actual test.

Deutsche Investitionen sprudeln wieder,"28. Oktober 2016 Tamara Wojewodina Die Wirtschaftskrise in Russland eröffnet neue Möglichkeiten für Unternehmen. Während der Export einbricht, steigt die Anzahl neuer Projekte überraschend auf Vorkrisenniveau.

Wenn Russen „pojechali“, „los geht’s“, sagen, dann kann etwas Alltägliches wie eine Taxifahrt bevorstehen. Oder etwas Außergewöhnliches wie ein Flug in den Weltraum – jeder hierzulande kennt den saloppen Ausruf von Juri Gagarin vor seinem ersten Flug. Und so meint der Deutsche Oliver Hermes eher Gagarin als Taxi, als er im Sommer mit der Schere in der Hand„Pojechali“ rief und das Bändchen einer nagelneuen Wilo-Fabrik durchschnitt. Hermes, der Vorstandsvorsitzende des Dortmunder Pumpenherstellers, war zur Werkseröffnung eingeflogen, genauso wie Russlands Premier Dmitrij Medwedew samt etwa 400 weiteren Gästen aus Deutschland und Russland. 
Natürlich ist eine Werkseröffnung so wenig ein Sprung ins Weltall wie die investierten 35 Millionen Euro der Dortmunder ein Riesenbetrag. Dennoch zeigt der hohe Besuch, wie wichtig gute Nachrichten über Investitionen aus dem Ausland für die Regierung derzeit sind. Die 450 neuen Mitarbeiter sollen nun jährlich bis zu 70 000 Pumpen herstellen, etwa für kommunaleBetriebe. Der Anteil lokaler Produktion beträgt 30 Prozent und soll in den kommenden Jahren auf 80 Prozent steigen. Die Geschäfte liefen in Russland schon immer gut für Wilo. Fast zehn Prozent des Umsatzes, etwa 100 Millionen Euro, macht das Unternehmen hierzulande. Mit der neuen Fabrik, eigentlich schon 2013 geplant, wollen sich die Dortmunder nun für rauere Zeitenwappnen. 
Das neue Werk von Wilo ist in diesem Jahr die größte Investition eines deutschen Unternehmens, aber bei Weitem nicht die einzige. Der Pumpenhersteller gehört zu einer Riege von Unternehmen, die gerade jetzt in Russland investieren. Die meisten versuchen, durch Lokalisierung die Krise abzufedern, sich öffentliche Aufträge zu sichern oder Protektionismus zu umgehen. So ist zwar der Export aus Deutschland nach Russland in den vergangenen beiden Jahren von etwa 42 auf 21,5 Milliarden Euro gesunken. Auch weil schrumpfende Öleinnahmen den Rubel stürzen ließen. Anders sieht das Bild aber bei den Direktinvestitionen aus. Russland lockt Mittelständler Deutsche Investitionen in Russland auf Rekordhoch Auch hier hatte es mit Beginn der Krise und der Einführung der Sanktionen im Zuge des Ukraine-Konflikts einen merklichen Einbruch gegeben. Hatten deutsche Firmen 2013 noch etwa 660 Millionen investiert, zogen sie 2014 nach Angaben der Bundesbank netto etwa 90 Millionen Euro ab. Doch schon 2015 kam die Wende. Mit 1,78 Milliarden fiel das positive Investitionssaldo so hoch aus wie seit 2008 nicht mehr. Die russische Zentralbank weist zwar etwas andere Zahlen aus. Ihr zufolge stiegen die deutschen Direktinvestitionen zwischen 2014 und 2015 von 311 Millionen auf 1,3 Milliarden Euro. Doch im Grunde bestätigen sie den Trend. 
Der größte Unterschied zu der Zeit vor der Krise, sagt Alexander Ivlev, Russland-Chef der Beratungsfirma Ernst and Young (EY) in Russland, ist, dass vor allem international orientierte Mittelständler nach Russland kommen. So hat die Firma Gühring aus Albstadt im Juni eine Werkzeugfabrik in Nischnij Nowgorod eröffnet und acht Millionen Euro in die Produktion investiert. Der Zulieferer Edscha mit Sitz in Remscheid investierte vier Millionen Euro in die Produktion von Scharnieren für Autotüren in Togliatti, wo auch der Lada-Hersteller Avtovaz ansässig ist. Besonders viel Aufmerksamkeit bekam der Landmaschinenhersteller Claas, der Anfang des Sommers einen Sonderinvestitionsvertrag mit der russischen Regierung unterschrieben hat. Seine Mähdrescher gelten von nun an als russische Fahrzeuge, was dazu führt, dass russische Bauern nun beim Kauf eines Claas auf staatliche Zuschüsse hoffen können. Im Gegenzug verpflichtete sich das deutsche Unternehmen, weitere zehn Millionen Euro in die lokale Fertigung zu pumpen, zusätzlich zu den 120 Millionen, die bereits geflossen sind. Roter Teppich für Investoren Schlupfloch im Sanktionskrieg: Rechtssicherheit für ausländische Investoren „Ein großer Teil der Investitionen fließt aktuell in die Produktion“, erklärt Experte Ivlev. Auch weil der Markteintritt derzeit sehr günstig sei. Löhne und Baukosten sind in Euro gerechnet deutlich zurückgegangen. In einer Studie hat EY aktuell über 200 neue Investitionsprojekte in Russland gezählt. Noch im vergangenen Jahr lag die Zahl der Projekte bei 125. Überhaupt wurde die Marke von 200 in den jährlichen EY-Studien lediglich im Jahr 2010 überschritten. Wenig überraschend landete Deutschland bei den Herkunftsländern der Investoren in Russland auf Platz eins mit insgesamt 36 Projekten und über 2 000 neu geschaffenen Jobs. 
„Der russischen Regierung sind Investitionen angesichts der Wirtschaftskrise und des Sanktionsregimes überaus wichtig“, sagt Matthias Schepp, Vorstandsvorsitzender der Deutsch-Russischen Auslandshandelskammer. „Wer Technologie transferiert und sich entscheidet, in Russland zu produzieren, bekommt einen roten Teppich ausgerollt.“ 
Ob der Investitionsboom auch in diesem Jahr weitergeht, ist noch offen. Die Daten der Bundesbank weisen für das erste Quartal bereits einen Wert von über einer Milliarde Euro aus. Die russische Zentralbank kommt lediglich auf rund 300 Millionen Euro frische Investitionen. 
Bei Wilo jedenfalls herrscht noch Optimismus. „Russland ist für uns in den nächsten Jahrzehnten ein hoch attraktiver Markt“, sagte Jens Dallendörfer, Generaldirektor von Wilo Rus, bei der Werkseröffnung. „Wir sehen das Werk auch als Exportplattform für den Wirtschaftsraum von Lissabon bis Wladiwostok und die Länder der Eurasischen Wirtschaftsunion.“",1
