Re: Why Did Attorney General Loretta Lynch Plead The Fifth?,"Why Did Attorney General Loretta Lynch Plead The Fifth? Barracuda Brigade 2016-10-28 Print The administration is blocking congressional probe into cash payments to Iran. Of course she needs to plead the 5th. She either can‚Äôt recall, refuses to answer, or just plain deflects the question. Straight up corruption at its finest! 
100percentfedUp.com ; Talk about covering your ass! Loretta Lynch did just that when she plead the Fifth to avoid incriminating herself over payments to Iran‚Ä¶Corrupt to the core! Attorney General Loretta Lynch is declining to comply with an investigation by leading members of Congress about the Obama administration‚Äôs secret efforts to send Iran $1.7 billion in cash earlier this year, prompting accusations that Lynch has ‚Äúpleaded the Fifth‚Äù Amendment to avoid incriminating herself over these payments, according to lawmakers and communications exclusively obtained by the Washington Free Beacon. 
Sen. Marco Rubio (R., Fla.) and Rep. Mike Pompeo (R., Kan.) initially presented Lynch in October with a series of questions about how the cash payment to Iran was approved and delivered. 
In an Oct. 24 response, Assistant Attorney General Peter Kadzik responded on Lynch‚Äôs behalf, refusing to answer the questions and informing the lawmakers that they are barred from publicly disclosing any details about the cash payment, which was bound up in a ransom deal aimed at freeing several American hostages from Iran. 
The response from the attorney general‚Äôs office is ‚Äúunacceptable‚Äù and provides evidence that Lynch has chosen to ‚Äúessentially plead the fifth and refuse to respond to inquiries regarding [her]role in providing cash to the world‚Äôs foremost state sponsor of terrorism,‚Äù Rubio and Pompeo wrote on Friday in a follow-up letter to Lynch.

BREAKING: Weiner Cooperating With FBI On Hillary Email Investigation,"Red State : 
Fox News Sunday reported this morning that Anthony Weiner is cooperating with the FBI, which has re-opened (yes, lefties: ‚Äúre-opened‚Äù) the investigation into Hillary Clinton‚Äôs classified emails. Watch as Chris Wallace reports the breaking news during the panel segment near the end of the show: 
And the news is breaking while we‚Äôre on the air. Our colleague Bret Baier has just sent us an e-mail saying he has two sources who say that Anthony Weiner, who also had co-ownership of that laptop with his estranged wife Huma Abedin, is cooperating with the FBI investigation, had given them the laptop, so therefore they didn‚Äôt need a warrant to get in to see the contents of said laptop. Pretty interesting development. 
Targets of federal investigations will often cooperate, hoping that they will get consideration from a judge at sentencing. Given Weiner‚Äôs well-known penchant for lying, it‚Äôs hard to believe that a prosecutor would give Weiner a deal based on an agreement to testify, unless his testimony were very strongly corroborated by hard evidence. But cooperation can take many forms ‚Äî and, as Wallace indicated on this morning‚Äôs show, one of those forms could be signing a consent form to allow   the contents of devices that they could probably get a warrant for anyway. We‚Äôll see if Weiner‚Äôs cooperation extends beyond that. More Related",1

FANTASTIC! TRUMP'S 7 POINT PLAN To Reform Healthcare Begins With A Bombshell! ¬ª 100percentfedUp.com,"Email HEALTHCARE REFORM TO MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN 
Since March of 2010, the American people have had to suffer under the incredible economic burden of the Affordable Care Act‚ÄîObamacare. This legislation, passed by totally partisan votes in the House and Senate and signed into law by the most divisive and partisan President in American history, has tragically but predictably resulted in runaway costs, websites that don‚Äôt work, greater rationing of care, higher premiums, less competition and fewer choices. Obamacare has raised the economic uncertainty of every single person residing in this country. As it appears Obamacare is certain to collapse of its own weight, the damage done by the Democrats and President Obama, and abetted by the Supreme Court, will be difficult to repair unless the next President and a Republican congress lead the effort to bring much-needed free market reforms to the healthcare industry. 
Congress must act. Our elected representatives in the House and Senate must: 
1. Completely repeal Obamacare. Our elected representatives must eliminate the individual mandate. No person should be required to buy insurance unless he or she wants to. 
2. Modify existing law that inhibits the sale of health insurance across state lines. As long as the plan purchased complies with state requirements, any vendor ought to be able to offer insurance in any state. By allowing full competition in this market, insurance costs will go down and consumer satisfaction will go up. 
3. Allow individuals to fully deduct health insurance premium payments from their tax returns under the current tax system. Businesses are allowed to take these deductions so why wouldn‚Äôt Congress allow individuals the same exemptions? As we allow the free market to provide insurance coverage opportunities to companies and individuals, we must also make sure that no one slips through the cracks simply because they cannot afford insurance. We must review basic options for Medicaid and work with states to ensure that those who want healthcare coverage can have it. TRENDING ON 100% Fed Up ",1

"BREAKING! NYPD Ready To Make Arrests In Weiner Case‚Ä¶Hillary Visited Pedophile Island At Least 6 Times‚Ä¶Money Laundering, Underage Sex, Pay-for-Play,Proof of Inappropriate Handling Classified Information ¬ª 100percentfedUp.com","BREAKING! NYPD Ready To Make Arrests In Weiner Case‚Ä¶Hillary Visited Pedophile Island At Least 6 Times‚Ä¶Money Laundering, Underage Sex, Pay-for-Play,Proof of Inappropriate Handling Classified Information Blackwater USA Founder, Retired Navy Seal Erik Prince 
Prince claimed he had insider knowledge of the investigation that could help explain why FBI Director James Comey had to announce he was reopening the investigation into Clinton‚Äôs email server last week. 
‚ÄúBecause of Weinergate and the sexting scandal, the NYPD started investigating it. Through a subpoena, through a warrant, they searched his laptop, and sure enough, found those 650,000 emails. They found way more stuff than just more information pertaining to the inappropriate sexting the guy was doing,‚Äù Prince claimed. 
‚ÄúThey found State Department emails. They found a lot of other really damning criminal information, including money laundering, including the fact that Hillary went to this sex island with convicted pedophile Jeffrey Epstein. Bill Clinton went there more than 20 times. Hillary Clinton went there at least six times,‚Äù he said. 
‚ÄúThe amount of garbage that they found in these emails, of criminal activity by Hillary, by her immediate circle, and even by other Democratic members of Congress was so disgusting they gave it to the FBI, and they said, ‚ÄòWe‚Äôre going to go public with this if you don‚Äôt reopen the investigation and you don‚Äôt do the right thing with timely indictments,‚Äô‚Äù Prince explained. 
‚ÄúI believe ‚Äì I know, and this is from a very well-placed source of mine at 1PP, One Police Plaza in New York ‚Äì the NYPD wanted to do a press conference announcing the warrants and the additional arrests they were making in this investigation, and they‚Äôve gotten huge pushback, to the point of coercion, from the Justice Department, with the Justice Department threatening to charge someone that had been unrelated in the accidental heart attack death of Eric Garner almost two years ago. That‚Äôs the level of pushback the Obama Justice Department is doing against actually seeking justice in the email and other related criminal matters,‚Äù Prince said. 
‚ÄúThere‚Äôs five different parts of the FBI conducting investigations into these things, with constant downdrafts from the Obama Justice Department. So in the, I hope, unlikely and very unfortunate event that Hillary Clinton is elected president, we will have a constitutional crisis that we have not seen since, I believe, 1860,‚Äù Prince declared. 
Marlow asked Prince to clarify these revelations. 
‚ÄúNYPD was the first one to look at that laptop,‚Äù Prince elaborated. ‚ÄúWeiner and Huma Abedin, his wife ‚Äì the closest adviser of Hillary Clinton for 20 years ‚Äì have both flipped. They are cooperating with the government. They both have ‚Äì they see potential jail time of many years for their crimes, for Huma Abedin sending and receiving and even storing hundreds of thousands of messages from the State Department server and from Hillary Clinton‚Äôs own homebrew server, which contained classified information. Weiner faces all kinds of exposure for the inappropriate sexting that was going on and for other information that they found.‚Äù 
‚ÄúSo NYPD first gets that computer. They see how disgusting it is. They keep a copy of everything, and they pass a copy on to the FBI, which finally pushes the FBI off their chairs, making Comey reopen that investigation, which was indicated in the letter last week. The point being, NYPD has all the information, and they will pursue justice within their rights if the FBI doesn‚Äôt,‚Äù Prince contended. 
‚ÄúThere is all kinds of criminal culpability through all the emails they‚Äôve seen of that 650,000, including money laundering, underage sex, pay-for-play, and, of course, plenty of proof of inappropriate handling, sending/receiving of classified information, up to SAP level Special Access Programs,‚Äù he stated. 
‚ÄúSo the plot thickens. NYPD was pushing because, as an article quoted one of the chiefs ‚Äì that‚Äôs the level just below commissioner ‚Äì he said as a parent, as a father with daughters, he could not let that level of evil continue,‚Äù Prince said. 
He noted that the FBI can investigate these matters, ‚Äúbut they can‚Äôt convene a grand jury. They can‚Äôt file charges.‚Äù 
‚ÄúThe prosecutors, the Justice Department has to do that,‚Äù he explained. ‚ÄúNow, as I understand it, Preet Bharara, the Manhattan prosecutor, has gotten ahold of some of this. From what I hear, he‚Äôs a stand-up guy, and hopefully he does the right thing.‚Äù 
Marlow agreed that Bharara‚Äôs ‚Äústerling reputation‚Äù as a determined prosecutor was ‚Äúbad news for the Clintons.‚Äù 
Prince agreed, but said, ‚ÄúIf people are willing to bend or break the law and don‚Äôt really care about the Constitution or due process ‚Äì if you‚Äôre willing to use Stalinist tactics against someone ‚Äì who knows what level of pressure‚Äù could be brought to bear against even the most tenacious law enforcement officials? 
Listen to interview here: 
‚ÄúThe point being, fortunately, it‚Äôs not just the FBI; [there are] five different offices that are in the hunt for justice, but the NYPD has it as well,‚Äù Prince said, citing the Wall Street Journal reporting that has ‚Äúexposed downdraft, back pressure from the Justice Department‚Äù against both the FBI and NYPD, in an effort to ‚Äúkeep the sunlight and the disinfecting effects of the truth and transparency from shining on this great evil that has gone on, and is slowly being exposed.‚Äù 
‚ÄúThe Justice Department is trying to run out the clock, to elect Hillary Clinton, to prevent any real justice from being done,‚Äù he warned. 
As for the mayor of New York City, Prince said he has heard that ‚Äúde Blasio wants to stay away from this.‚Äù 
‚ÄúThe evidence is so bad, the email content is so bad, that I think even he wants to stay away from it, which is really telling,‚Äù he said.

Democrat Dr. Brenda Snipes was appointed by Jeb Bush in 2003 and is no stranger to controversy. On October 20, the Sun Sentinal reported that former Oakland Park Commissioner Anne Sallee noticed something troubling about her vote-by-mail ballot. It is missing Constitutional Amendment 2, the medical marijuana question. 
Sallee, now Broward chapter director of the Florida Restaurant and Lodging Association, knows her way around government. Yet she said she spent a week unsuccessfully trying to get someone at the Broward elections office to pay attention to her complaint. 
She was cleared on Wednesday of another election snafu, the early posting of primary election results. Her office also was criticized for sending out inaccurate voter ID cards, and for printing ballots for November that include the word ‚Äúno‚Äù in the ‚Äúyes‚Äù line on the county‚Äôs transportation sales surtax question.

FBI Director James Comey said Sunday that the agency has reviewed all of the Hillary Clinton emails recently discovered in an unrelated case and that his conclusion in July not to prosecute Clinton after the FBI‚Äôs original investigation into her use of private email server still stands. 
Comey informed Congress on Oct. 28 that the agency would, in the unrelated case, review additional emails related to Clinton‚Äôs time running the State Department from 2009 to 2013. 
‚ÄúSince my letter, the FBI investigative team has been working around the clock to process and review a large volume of emails,‚Äù Comey said Sunday in a follow-up letter to Congress. ‚ÄúDuring that time we reviewed all of the communications that were to or from Hilary Clinton as secretary of state.

To All Members of the University Community: 
As I‚Äôm sure many of you did, I watched the election coverage late into the night, and had the opportunity to visit with students and staff at a results-watching event sponsored by the Ginsberg Center at the Michigan Union. It will take quite some time to completely absorb the results from yesterday‚Äôs election, understand the full implications, and discern the long-term impact on our university and our nation . More immediately, in the aftermath of a close and highly contentious election we continue to embrace our most important responsibility as a university community. Our responsibility is to remain committed to education, discovery and intellectual honesty ‚Äì and to diversity, equity and inclusion. We are at our best when we come together to engage respectfully across our ideological differences; to support ALL who feel marginalized, threatened or unwelcome; and to pursue knowledge and understanding, as we always have, as the students, faculty and staff of the University of Michigan. There are reports of members of our community offering support to one another. Students are planning a vigil tonight on the Diag at 6 p.m. Our Center for Research on Teaching and Learning also has numerous resources available for faculty seeking help in cultivating classroom environments that are responsive to national issues. I also want to make everyone aware of some of the plans and events we have had in place for today and beyond. ¬∑ Our Gerald R. Ford School of Public Policy is holding a Post-Election Analysis from 4 to 5:30 p.m. today in the Weill Hall‚Äôs Annenberg Auditorium. Speakers include former U.S. Congressman John Dingell, former Ambassador Ron Weiser, and faculty members Mara Ostfeld, Betsey Stevenson and Marina Whitman. ¬∑ Our History Department has organized a community discussion led by faculty and students to include historical perspectives at 6 p.m. tonight in 1014 Tisch Hall. ¬∑ The Office of Student Life will provide resources and referrals for support on campus to students, faculty and staff at a location in the Michigan Union‚Äôs Willis Ward Lounge. It will be open today from 11 a.m. to 4 p.m. ¬∑ Our Office of Multi-Ethnic Student Affairs is offering an open space of support to help members of our community connect during open hours today. MESA‚Äôs office is in the Michigan Union, Room 2202. ¬∑ Tomorrow, our Ginsberg Center and Counseling and Psychological Services office is facilitating a Post-election Dialogue: Impact, Perspective-taking, and Moving Forward. This event is part of the Student Life Professional Development Conference at 1 ‚Äì 2 p.m. in the Michigan League‚Äôs Henderson Room. I know that other schools, colleges and offices across our campus are planning events as well. I thank everyone who is helping us come together and ask anyone scheduling a post election event post it on the University of Michigan Events Calendar. I hope all of us will continue to proudly embrace the opportunities before us as the students, faculty and staff of a great public research university governed by the people. Elections are often times of great change, but the values we stand for at U-M have been shaped over the course of nearly 200 years. Our mission remains as essential for society as ever: ‚Äú‚Ä¶to serve the people of Michigan and the world through preeminence in creating, communicating, preserving and applying knowledge, art, and academic values, and in developing leaders and citizens who will challenge the present and enrich the future.‚Äù I look forward to working together with all of you to advance the work we do in service of the public ‚Äì and to ensure that the University of Michigan will always be a welcoming place for all members of society.

BOOM! MATH SHOWS Trump Would Have Beaten Obama In Romney-Obama Election ¬ª 100percentfedUp.com,"Email For Republican politicians like Ohio Governor John Kasich who refused to get behind Donald J. Trump‚Ä¶it turns out Trump was right‚Ä¶he didn‚Äôt need you. In spite of the massive media force who came out against him, and the ‚Äònever Trumpers‚Äô from his own party who worked very hard to defeat him, if Obama was running against Donald J. Trump today, Trump would have beaten him‚Ä¶ 
It‚Äôs easy to glance at Tuesday‚Äôs popular vote ‚Äî which, with 92 percent of all precincts reporting, shows Hillary Clinton with six million fewer votes than Barack Obama won in 2012 ‚Äì and reach the conclusion that Clinton lost the White House because she failed to turn out the Democratic base. But the truth is much more complicated. While she underperformed relative to Obama‚Äôs 2012 totals in several Midwestern states ‚Äî Ohio, Michigan, Iowa, and Wisconsin ‚Äî Clinton ran virtually even with Obama in the battlegrounds of Pennsylvania, North Carolina, Virginia, Nevada, and New Hampshire. What‚Äôs more, she far surpassed Obama‚Äôs 2012 vote total in Florida, the country‚Äôs biggest swing state. Yet somehow, while Obama carried Florida, Clinton lost it. Which brings us to an important question: Was Donald Trump just good enough to beat a bad Democratic opponent on Tuesday, or does he deserve far more credit? Could he, for instance, have competed with the vaunted Obama machine? The answer, somewhat shockingly, is yes. 
A review of vote totals in the past two elections reveals that Trump 2016 would have defeated Obama 2012 in the electoral college. (Disclaimer: This obviously is an apples-to-oranges exercise because no two elections are the same, nor are any two electorates. Still, unlike debating whether the 2016 Cubs would defeat the 1927 Yankees, this is not an entirely abstract argument; a comparison of their respective performances in the country‚Äôs most competitive states shows Trump edging Obama in a hypothetical head-to-head matchup.) The math might seem impossible. After all, Obama won nearly 66 million votes in 2012; Trump is currently at 59.5 million and should finish around 60 million, which will actually be one million fewer votes than Mitt Romney won. How, then, could Trump have topped Obama in the electoral college? The answer: Republican turnout lagged in certain parts of the country but shot through the roof in the nation‚Äôs most critical battleground states. Let‚Äôs look at them individually, in descending order by population, and do the electoral-vote math. The 2016 totals aren‚Äôt yet final because not all precincts have reported.

#BoycottComedian‚Ä¶ROBERT DENIRO Wanted ‚ÄúTo Punch Trump In The Face‚Äù‚Ä¶Supports Anti-Trump Rioters‚Ä¶Now Wants Americans To Support His New Movie [VIDEO],"Go to Article Donald Trump was willing to give up a very fulfilling life that took decades to build, so he could step up and take control of an out of control government. He and his family have already sacrificed so much because he chose to put his country first. Making sacrifices is certainly not something loudmouth liberals like Robert DeNiro are accustomed to. DeNiro was very vocal about his opposition to the wildly successful business man Donald J. Trump. He felt so strongly about his hate for Trump that made a video where he angrily stated he‚Äôd like to, ‚Äúpunch him in the face.‚Äù Now that Trump won the election in a landslide, DeNiro has chosen to get behind the Trump rioters who are terrorizing cities across America. Anti-Trump rioters are breaking windows, using baseball bats to smash the windshields of innocent citizens who get trapped in their hellish protests as they try to escape. Women who are taking part in the protests are being punched in the faces by men who are also taking part in the George Soros funded protests. American flags are being burned and families who are walking in major cities are being subjected to the most vile and disgusting, hateful language and images imaginable. If this is the kind of America that Robert DiNero is openly supporting? And if so, why would any American pay to see his movie,‚ÄùComedian‚Äù? 
Robert De Niro gave anti-Donald Trump protesters across the United States his backing Friday as he spoke about how ‚Äúdepressed‚Äù the tycoon‚Äôs win in the presidential election had made him. 
The 73-year-old star was on the red carpet at the world premiere of his new film ‚ÄúThe Comedian‚Äù in Los Angeles when he was asked how he was coping with Trump‚Äôs victory over Democratic rival Hillary Clinton. 
‚ÄúHow am I doing? I‚Äôm very depressed,‚Äù the famously laconic ‚ÄúRaging Bull‚Äù actor told reporters. 
‚ÄúWe have to just wait and see how things go and keep our eyes ever vigilant on the new government.‚Äù 
Asked if he thought the protests were an appropriate response to the outcome of Tuesday‚Äôs election, he replied: ‚ÄúYes, absolutely. Things aren‚Äôt being done right.‚Äù 
Demonstrators took to the streets in Miami, Los Angeles, New York and other US cities for a third straight night on Friday. 
In Manhattan, they held signs reading ‚ÄúYour Wall Can‚Äôt Stand in Our Way‚Äù ‚Äî a reference to the anti-immigration barrier the billionaire has promised to build on the US border with Mexico. 
De Niro hasn‚Äôt minced his words in his criticism of Trump, describing him as ‚Äúa punk,‚Äù ‚Äúa pig‚Äù and ‚Äúan idiot.‚Äù 
‚ÄúI‚Äôd like to punch him in the face,‚Äù he said before the election. 
Earlier in the day a town in southern Italy where De Niro‚Äôs grandparents came from offered the actor a means of escape. 
‚ÄúIf, after the disappointment of Trump, he wants to take refuge here, we are ready to welcome him,‚Äù said Antonio Cerio, the mayor of Ferrazzano. 
‚ÄúThe Comedian,‚Äù De Niro‚Äôs passion project which took him eight years to bring to the big screen, was part of this year‚Äôs program for the American Film Institute‚Äôs annual AFI Fest in Los Angeles. ‚Äì Yahoo

HE‚ÄôS NEVER SOLD AN ORIGINAL PAINTING UNTIL NOW‚Ä¶And This One‚Äôs Going In The White House,"John McNaughton is a special American painter because of his subject matter and the intensity in which he portrays our current government‚Ä¶troubled and corrupt. The Forgotten Man painting is amazing in its symbolism. 
Here‚Äôs how McNaughton describes the painting: 
Against the background of a darkening sky, all of the past Presidents of the United States gather before the White House, as if to commemorate some great event. In the left hand corner of the painting sits a man. That man, with his head bowed appears distraught and hopeless as he contemplates his future. Some of the past Presidents try to console him while looking in the direction of the modern Presidents as if to say, ‚ÄúWhat have you done?‚Äù Many of these modern Presidents, seemingly oblivious to anything other than themselves, appear to be congratulating each other on their great accomplishments. In front of the man, paper trash is blowing in the wind. Crumpled dollar bills, legislative documents, and, like a whisper‚Äîthe U.S. Constitution beneath the foot of Barack Obama. 
THE FORGOTTEN MAN‚Ä¶ 
McNaughton never sells his original paintings BUT he made an exception this time. He sold this painting to Sean Hannity so Hannity could give it to Donald Trump. Awesome, huh? 
November 9th McNaughton announced via facebook that he sold the original to Sean Hannity: 
‚ÄúSean Hannity just purchased my painting ‚ÄúThe Forgotten Man‚Äù to give to Donald Trump to hang in the White House‚Äù

SORRY LIBERALS‚Ä¶You Can Stop With The Petitions‚Ä¶Hillary Did NOT Win The Popular Vote,"Go to Article Dear Abby, I supported a woman I knew had a history of criminal activity, who is married to a rapist and who left 4 men to die in Benghazi. She put our national security at grave risk by leaving top classified emails on her private server, and she took money from nations who throw gays off rooftops and treat women worse than cockroaches. She is likely very sick and would be unlikely to serve out her first term without someone there to prop her up, but nevertheless, I supported her anyhow, because she‚Äôs a Democrat and has a vagina. Someone told me she still has a chance of winning the presidency if I just signed a petition. They said that Trump really didn‚Äôt win, because Hillary won the popular vote. Is that true? 
Okay, let‚Äôs address this ‚ÄúHillary might win the popular vote, isn‚Äôt that Electoral College situation just awful‚Äù thing head on. 
No, it‚Äôs not awful. It‚Äôs great, and it protects the importance of your vote. It‚Äôs also uniquely American and demonstrates yet again the once-in-creation brilliance of the Founding Fathers. 
First of all, she‚Äôs probably not going to win the actual number of votes cast. She may win the number of votes counted, but not the votes cast. 
States don‚Äôt count their absentee ballots unless the number of outstanding absentee ballots is larger than the state margin of difference. If there is a margin of 1,000 votes counted and there are 1,300 absentee ballots outstanding, then the state tabulates those. If the number of outstanding absentee ballots wouldn‚Äôt influence the election results, then the absentee ballots aren‚Äôt counted. 
Who votes by absentee ballot? Students overseas, the military, businesspeople on trips, etc. The historical breakout for absentee ballots is about 67-33% Republican. In 2000, when Al Gore ‚Äúwon‚Äù the popular vote nationally by 500,000 votes and the liberal media screamed bloody murder, there were 2 million absentee ballots in California alone. A 67-33 breakout of those yields a 1.33- to 0.667-million Republican vote advantage, so Bush would have gotten a 667,000-vote margin from California‚Äôs uncounted absentee ballots alone! So much for Gore‚Äôs 500,000 popular vote ‚Äúvictory.‚Äù (That was the headline on the N.Y. Times, and it was the lead story on NBC Nightly News, right? No? You‚Äôre kidding.) 
Getting back to the ‚Äúwin the popular vote/lose the Electoral College‚Äù scenario: Thank G-d we have that, or else California and N.Y. would determine every election. Every time. 
But the Electoral College brilliantly smooths out the variances in the voting proclivities among states and regions. Farmers in the middle of the country and importers and exporters on the shore get roughly equal say, as do Madison Ave. execs and factory workers in Tennessee. 
Shortcomings? Sure. The E.C. can make an R vote meaningless in a very few heavily D states or vice versa. But without the Electoral College, the country‚Äôs entire population is subject to the disproportionate voting preferences of the few most populous states. ‚Äì American Thinker Comment on this Article Via Your Facebook Account Comment on this Article Via Your Disqus Account Follow Us on Facebook!",1

LOL! BRITISH WIFE Of LIB ACTOR Who Said: ‚ÄúThere Will Never Be A President Donald Trump‚Äù‚Ä¶Warns Americans About President-Elect Trump [VIDEO],"Go to Article 
Political activist and Hillary supporter Amal Clooney traveled to Texas to warn Americans about our elected President Donald J. Trump and his tough immigration policies. Maybe she didn‚Äôt get the memo‚Ä¶Trump‚Äôs tough immigration stance is what catapulted him to the top of the heap in the crowded pack of GOP primary contenders. It wasn‚Äôt too long ago that her arrogant liberal husband announced with great confidence, ‚ÄúThere will never be a President Trump‚Äù. 
Perhaps Amal should‚Äôve traveled to some of the border towns if she wanted to get a clear picture of how illegal immigration is affecting our nation. Aliens crossing our borders illegally have destroyed the property of American ranchers, and threatened the safety and security of American citizens living in homes in or near the US -Mexican border towns‚Ä¶ 
Amal Clooney has warned that many of president-elect Trump‚Äôs proposals would be ‚Äòviolations of international law.‚Äô 
Speaking at the Texas Conference For Women at the Austin Convention Center on Tuesday, the international human rights lawyer, and wife of George Clooney, said she had concerns about America‚Äôs reputation under the real estate mogul‚Äôs plans. 
She noted that Trump‚Äôs comments during his campaign, ‚Äòthat there should be a religious test imposed on entering the U.S. or the fact that there should be state-sponsored torture or that families of suspected terrorists should all be killed ‚Äî all of those things are violations of international human rights law and the values that underlie that.‚Äô 
The 38-year-old wife said America‚Äôs reputation as a country with a strong human rights record and high moral standing was at risk. 
‚ÄòI think there‚Äôs some concern from abroad as to, ‚ÄúAre these things actually going to happen?‚Äù, or is the U.S. going to lose some of the moral standing that it has internationally,‚Äô according to the Hollywood Reporter. 
Perhaps its time to put our nation‚Äôs security and sovereignty before we worry about what people in other countries around the world think of us‚Ä¶ 
Both Amal and her Hollywood actor husband George, a staunch Hillary Clinton supporter, have spoken out against Trump in the past. 
Earlier this year, Amal Clooney called for Trump to be challenged on his extreme views. 
Watch George Clooney here whine about press giving Trump too much favorable press: 
‚ÄòWhen you listen to what the leading candidate on the Republican side has been saying about building walls, about excluding Mexicans and a complete shutdown of all Muslims entering in, and if you actually look at what he specifically said in that now infamous speech about Muslims, he kept saying, ‚ÄòThey only want jihad. They don‚Äôt believe in our way of life. They don‚Äôt respect our system,‚Äù Clooney said. Via: Daily Mail  ",1

DONALD TRUMP Calls Meeting With Press‚Ä¶Dresses Down Real Fake News Networks: ‚ÄúEveryone at CNN is a liar and you should be ashamed‚Äù,"Go to Article 
They had to know they had it coming‚Ä¶ 
Donald Trump scolded media big shots during an off-the-record Trump Tower sitdown on Monday, sources told The Post. 
‚ÄúIt was like a f‚Äìing firing squad,‚Äù one source said of the encounter. 
‚ÄúTrump started with [CNN chief] Jeff Zucker and said ‚ÄòI hate your network, everyone at CNN is a liar and you should be ashamed,‚Äô ‚Äù the source said. 
‚ÄúThe meeting was a total disaster. The TV execs and anchors went in there thinking they would be discussing the access they would get to the Trump administration, but instead they got a Trump-style dressing down,‚Äù the source added. 
A second source confirmed the fireworks. 
‚ÄúThe meeting took place in a big board room and there were about 30 or 40 people, including the big news anchors from all the networks,‚Äù the other source said. 
‚ÄúTrump kept saying, ‚ÄòWe‚Äôre in a room of liars, the deceitful dishonest media who got it all wrong.‚Äô He addressed everyone in the room calling the media dishonest, deceitful liars. He called out Jeff Zucker by name and said everyone at CNN was a liar, and CNN was [a] network of liars,‚Äù the source said. 
‚ÄúTrump didn‚Äôt say [NBC reporter] Katy Tur by name, but talked about an NBC female correspondent who got it wrong, then he referred to a horrible network correspondent who cried when Hillary lost who hosted a debate ‚Äì which was Martha Raddatz who was also in the room.‚Äù 
The stunned reporters tried to get a word in edgewise to discuss access to a Trump Administration. 
‚Äú[CBS Good Morning co-host Gayle] King did not stand up, but asked some question, ‚ÄòHow do you propose we the media work with you?‚Äô Chuck Todd asked some pretty pointed questions. David Muir asked ‚ÄòHow are you going to cope living in DC while your family is in NYC? It was a horrible meeting.‚Äù 
Here‚Äôs a sampling of Trump hitting back at the dishonest media while he was on the campaign trail. Trump did something no other presidential candidate has ever done before, he won the election in a landslide, in spite of the entire fake news empire working together to take him down: 
Trump spokeswoman Kellyanne Conway told reporters the gathering went well. 
‚ÄúExcellent meetings with the top executives of the major networks,‚Äù she said during a gaggle in the lobby of Trump Tower. ‚ÄúPretty unprecedented meeting we put together in two days.‚Äù 
The meeting was off the record, meaning the participants agreed not to talk about the substance of the conversations. 
The hour-long session included top execs from network and cable news channels. Among the attendees were NBC‚Äôs Deborah Turness, Lester Holt and Chuck Todd, ABC‚Äôs James Goldston, George Stephanopoulos, David Muir and Martha Raddatz, 
Also, CBS‚Äô Norah O‚ÄôDonnell John Dickerson, Charlie Rose, Christopher Isham and King, Fox News‚Äô Bill Shine, Jack Abernethy, Jay Wallace, Suzanne Scott, MSNBC‚Äôs Phil Griffin and CNN‚Äôs Jeff Zucker and Erin Burnett. -Via : NYP  ",1

FBI Director Comey‚Äôs ‚ÄòLeaked‚Äô Memo Explains Why He‚Äôs Reopening the Clinton Email Case,"
21st Century Wire says‚Ä¶ 
21WIRE reported on Friday about the FBI‚Äôs surprising announcement that it would be reopening the Clinton email case due to new evidence of ‚Äòclassified information‚Äô found on sex cheat Anthony Weiner‚Äôs (newly estranged husband of Clinton chief aid Huma Abedin) computer which was subject to a seperate investigation. Will this really yield anything significant in the 10 days running-up to the Nov 8th election, or is this just clever Democrat party smoke and mirrors? It seems that Washington‚Äôs political tricksters have already sprung into action‚Ä¶ 
After Comey‚Äôs shock announcement, a ‚Äúleaked‚Äù memo appeared out of nowhere, supplied to Fox News , in which Comey and the FBI seem to be going through a routine set of prescribed political moves designed to implement damage control. 
ELITE CIRCLES: FBI head James Comey and friend Hillary Clinton. 
Certainly, a desperate Democratic Party, and an even more desperate Obama White House (over the last 3 weeks, Obama and his wife Michelle have been out campaigning more that Hillary Clinton herself), could be pressuring or nudging the FBI on this volatile issue which could easily tilt a close presidential race against Donald Trump. Aside from the obvious potential of another Clinton scandal, yesterday‚Äôs FBI move could also be a prelude to the following possible scenarios: Protect the President, who is already deeply tied to the Clinton email cover-up Democratic Party Machine has created a distraction to cover-up latest Wikileaks dump. FBI are trying to restore lost public confidence over allegations of favoring Hillary Clintons. Create a controlled explosion this weekend to clear the decks for another salacious Trump scandal next week. 
NOTE: Despite calls from the Clinton camp for FBI to disclose what they have (which they cannot by law anyway, you‚Äôd think Hillary would have already known that), it is highly unlikely that the FBI will release any real specifics before the election ‚Äì if they have anything at all. It‚Äôs just too early to tell. 
SEE ALSO: FBI James Comey was board member of HSBC ‚Äì Clinton Foundation & Drug Cartel ‚Äòbank of choice‚Äô 
The FBI director stoked outrage last month when he announced that he would not recommend the Justice Department seek an indictment against Clinton or any of the other parties to the investigation ‚Äì allowing Clinton to dodge any criminal probe before the election ‚Äì despite the fact that Comey stated to a Congressional investigative committee that Clinton was ‚Äúextremely careless,‚Äù and that Clinton openly lied about her handling classified information on her unsecured private server throughout her tenure as the US Secretary of State. 
Zero Hedge adds: 
‚ÄúNow, it is the democrats turn to rage at Comey and the FBI, although Comey likely did not have much choice: had he kept the information secret, it certainly would have leaked as we predicted; as such his best recourse was to come clean, although many have speculated about the cryptic nature of the disclosure. Needless to say, all Comey would need to do to regain the Demcorats‚Äô trust and favor is to announce in just a few days that nothing material has been found and that the second probe is also over.‚Äù 
Here is ‚Äúleaked‚Äù (aka ‚Äòjust covering my ass) memo from FBI director James Comey: 
Watch this space. Here is a highlight reel of Hillary Clinton lying on at least 5 occasions when asked direct questions about her illegal private email server:

FBI REDUX: What‚Äôs Behind New Probe into Hillary Clinton Emails?,"
In a stunning turn of events 11 days before the 2016 presidential election, the FBI announced it is reopenning its investigation into Hillary Clinton‚Äôs email server case, by probing newly emerging emails linked to Hillary Clinton. 
‚ÄòNEW PROBE‚Äô‚Äì The FBI gives Hillary Clinton a second look. (Photo illustraion 21WIRE) 
FBI October Surprise? 
According to reports , in a letter written today, FBI Director James Comey , stated that the FBI has begun a new probe into Hillary Clinton related emails once again. Comey offered scant details about the new probe, but due to an unrelated case, additional classified material may have been mishandled on Clinton‚Äôs personal email server. 
CNBC reported the latest FBI developments, including a passage from Comey‚Äôs letter discussing the new investigation: 
‚ÄúIn previous congressional testimony, I referred to the fact that the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) had completed its investigation of former Secretary Clinton‚Äôs personal email server. Due to recent developments, I am writing to supplement my previous testimony,‚Äù Comey wrote. 
In connection with an unrelated case, the FBI has learned of the existence of emails that appear to be pertinent to the investigation. I am writing to inform you that the investigative team briefed me on this yesterday, and I agreed that the FBI should take appropriate investigative steps designed to allow investigators to review these emails to determine whether they contain classified information, as well as to assess their importance to our investigation,‚Äù he added. 
Although the FBI cannot yet assess whether or not this material may be significant, and I cannot predict how long it will take us to complete this additional work, I believe it is important to update your Committees about our efforts in light of my previous testimony,‚Äù Comey concluded.‚Äù 
Huma‚Äôs Estranged ‚ÄòSexting‚Äô Husband 
According to a new report released via The New York Times : 
‚ÄúThe presidential campaign was rocked on Friday after federal law enforcement officials said that emails pertinent to the now-closed investigation into Hillary Clinton ‚Äôs private email server were discovered on a computer belonging to Anthony D. Weiner, the estranged husband of a top Clinton aide.‚Äù ‚Äú In a letter to Congress , the F.B.I. director, James B. Comey, said the emails had surfaced in an unrelated case, which law enforcement officials said was an F.B.I. investigation into illicit text messages from Mr. Weiner to a 15-year-old girl in North Carolina. Mr. Weiner, a former Democratic congressman from New York, is married to Huma Abedin, the top aide.‚Äù Comey has come under fire recently for apparently letting Clinton off the hook for mishandling, and lying to Congress, about classified emails coming through her ‚Äòhome brew‚Äô email server while she was Secretary of State. After previously closing the case, Comey has done a U-turn and is now saying the FBI will review the new emails to for classified information, and see whether it was mishandled. 
This unprecedented investigative move comes just two days after a Wikileaks docu-dump revealed a memo containing detailed financial information between Clinton Foundation donors and former president Bill Clinton ‚Äòs private financial activities. Among those included in the memo, was a $30 million dollar business arrangement under ‚ÄúBill Clinton, Inc.,‚Äù with another $66 million dollar deal scheduled over nine years. 
The following is a tweet from Brad Jaffy of NBC Nightly News containing the new FBI recommendation‚Ä¶ 
The new investigation into the Clinton camp will most certainly spark new ‚ÄòPay-to-Play‚Äô allegations , as the new FBI revelations also comes days after a Project Veritas hidden camera sting operation revealed that the Democratic consultant Robert Creamer of Democracy Partners, discussed ways to commit ‚Äòlarge-scale‚Äô voter fraud as well as paying political agitators to cause violence at Donald Trump rallies. Out of Creamer‚Äôs 342 visits to the White House, also included his wife, a 9-term Illinois Democratic congresswoman, Jan Schakowsky some 47 times. White House visitor records show that Schakowsky took 47 ‚Äúprivate meetings with Obama or his senior staff,‚Äù also over the past year. The consultancy Democracy Partners appears to have applied Schakowsky as a political buffering point, possibly in the event of a fallout over their operations at a grassroots level. The impetus of this type of procedural separation is to keep certain high-ranking officials of the hook in case of a massive upheaval over various underhanded campaign tactics ‚Äì thus giving a political campaign or political entity plausible deniability. ‚ÄòCAUGHT ON FILM‚Äô ‚Äì Robert Creamer resigns over a massive Democratic Party controversy.

Terry McAuliffe , ‚Äúhelped steer $675,000 to the election campaign of the wife of an FBI official who went on to lead the probe into Hillary Clinton‚Äôs use of a private email system, according to a report.‚Äù The NY Post also reported on the matter this past week: 
‚ÄúThe political action committee of McAuliffe, the Clinton loyalist, gave $467,500 to the state Senate campaign of the wife of Andrew McCabe, who is now deputy director of the FBI, according to the Wall Street Journal . 
The report states Jill McCabe received an additional $207,788 from the Virginia Democratic Party, which is heavily influenced by McAuliffe. 
The money directed by McAuliffe began flowing two months after the FBI investigation into Clinton began in July 2015. Around that time, the candidate‚Äôs husband was promoted from running the Washington field office for the FBI to the No. 3 position at the bureau.‚Äù 
In a CNN report from October 18th, a week before the McAuliffe revelations, ‚Äú‚Ä¶According to notes from interviews conducted during an FBI investigation into Clinton‚Äôs email practices, Undersecretary of State Patrick Kennedy personally tried to convince FBI officials that the email should be declassified. One interviewee described feeling ‚Äúpressured‚Äù by another FBI official at Kennedy‚Äôs request.‚Äù 
The newly reopened FBI investigation into Clinton could be related to all or some of the items listed above, but there‚Äôs no doubt that due to public backlash the FBI received following the first Clinton investigation, in addition to concerns over dealings between the FBI and Clinton associates ‚Äì the agency needed to save face. 
It remains to be seen how new case will impact the US Presidential election.

PARTY CORRUPTION: Clinton Campaign Directly Tied to Disgraced DNC Consultant,"A tidal wave of revelations is pouring out of the Clinton campaign as the 2016 presidential election draws to a close. 
‚ÄòMELTDOWN‚Äô‚Äì The Clinton campaign continues to unravel following a series of troubling details. (Photo illustration 21WIRE) 
Over the weekend, it was discovered through a Wikileaks email dump, that Neera Tanden of the Center for American Progress , John Podesta ‚Äòs top aide, had an email exchange with Michael Lux of Progressive Strategies revealing that the Democratic consultant Robert Creamer of Democracy Partners, was closely allied with Clinton campaign manager Robby Mook . 
‚ÄòPOLITICAL BOMBSHELL‚Äô‚Äì Clinton campaign manager Robby Mook had close ties to disgraced DNC consultant Robert Creamer. (Image Source: Lockerdome ) 
Creamer gained national attention when he became the subject of video sting operation captured by the investigative non-profit Project Veritas . Not only was it revealed that the Creamer discussed ways to commit voter fraud and violence at Donald Trump rallies on camera ‚Äì he also met with White House officials some 342 times over the past year, including 47 private meetings with President Obama or other senior officials. 
‚ÄòDNC SCANDAL‚Äô‚Äì Robert Creamer of Democracy Partners and Democratic congresswoman Jan Schakowsky. (Image Source: National Vanguard ) 
Creamer‚Äôs visits to the White House also included his wife, a 9-term Illinois Democratic congresswoman Jan Schakowsky . 
White House visitor records have shown that Schakowsky took 47 ‚Äúprivate meetings with Obama or his senior staff,‚Äù over the past year. The consultancy Democracy Partners appears to have applied Schakowsky as a political buffering point, in the event of a fallout over their operations at a grassroots level. The nature of this type of procedural separation is to keep certain high-ranking officials of the hook in case of a massive upheaval over various underhanded campaign tactics , potentially giving the Clinton campaign and the DNC plausible deniability. 
The Mook fallout is the latest in a laundry list of problems for the Clinton campaign and comes at a time when interim DNC chair Donna Brazile , is embroiled in controversy of over leaked debate questions prior to at least two 2016 town hall debates. Brazile stepped down from her role at CNN earlier in October. Here‚Äôs a passage from the Daily Caller describing the scenario: 
‚ÄúDonna Brazile, the interim chair of the Democratic National Committee, began providing town hall and debate questions to the Clinton campaign earlier than previously known, emails released by WikiLeaks on Monday show.‚Äù 
The article continued by stating that the revelations expose that the interim DNC chair was more deeply involved than previously outlined: 
‚ÄúIn the March 12 exchange, Brazile mentions [Roland] Martin by name and offers to provide more than just the one town hall question that she is known to have shared with the campaign. 
‚ÄúI‚Äôll send a few more. Though some questions Roland submitted,‚Äù Brazile wrote to Palmieri in the March 12 email thread, which is entitled ‚ÄúFrom time to time I get the questions in advance.‚Äù 
Martin, is a commentator for TV One and the host of News One Now , as well as a CNN contributor. 
In another matter, the Wall Street Journal revealed the following , while disclosing an apparently contentious relationship between the FBI and DOJ, while the FBI appears to be somewhat fractured over the latest email server case developments: 
‚ÄúThe latest development began in early October when New York-based FBI officials notified Andrew McCabe [of the Terry McAuliffe campaign contribution scandal], the bureau‚Äôs second-in-command, that while investigating Mr. Weiner for possibly sending sexually charged messages to a teenage minor, they had recovered a laptop. Many of the 650,000 emails on the computer, they said, were from the accounts of Ms. Abedin, according to people familiar with the matter.‚Äù 
Some critics have called for McCabe to recuse himself after it was revealed his wife received $675,000 from a well-known Clinton confidant, Terry McAuliffe . This was further underlined after the House Oversight Commitee wanted more information about the Senate campaign of Dr. Jill McCabe and its ties to the Clintons. 
The alleged internal feud among agencies was compounded when Attorney General Loretta Lynch and Deputy Attorney General Sally Yates ‚Äòobjected‚Äô to FBI Director James Comey reopening the Clinton email server case this past week ‚Äì something that added to the Lynch/Clinton tarmac meeting before the first FBI ruling in the Clinton case. 
According to a report filed by Zero Hedge , a close friend of Podesta, Peter Kadzik , the Assistant Attorney General of the Department of Justice (DOJ), will be in charge of a probe into Huma Abedin , Clintion‚Äôs closest aide. 
Interestingly, as a mountain of controversy envelops the Clinton campaign, the FBI is now conducting an early inquiry into former Trump campaign manager Paul Manafort , over his alleged foreign business connections. 
Back in August, the following business connection was revealed by NBC news : 
‚ÄúIn 2008, according to court records, senior Trump aide Paul Manafort‚Äôs firm was involved with a Ukrainian oligarch named Dmytro Firtash in a plan to redevelop a famous New York hotel, the Drake. The total value of the project was $850 million. Firtash‚Äôs company planned to invest over $100 million, the records say. 
That same year, Firtash acknowledged to the U.S. ambassador in Ukraine that he got his start in business with the permission of a notorious Russian crime lord, according to a classified State Department cable. Other cables say Firtash made part of his fortune through sweetheart natural gas deals between Russia and the Ukraine.‚Äù 
Although the US State Department has determined that Firtash may have ties to a criminal enterprise in Russia ‚Äì so far, there‚Äôs nothing directly linking Manafort to any underground element at this time. 
Watch this space ‚Äì as the Russia/Trump meme fostered by mainstream media or some other politically polarizing element will look to deflect from the Clinton campaign meltdown.

WikiLeaks: Trump Rally Agitator and Clinton Campaign Manager Are ‚ÄòClose‚Äô 
Top Clinton aides discussed Bob Creamer and his ‚Äògrassroots/netroots‚Äô operation 
by Jim Stinson LifeZette 
Robert Creamer, the operative behind sending provocateurs to Donald Trump rallies, was close to Robby Mook, Hillary Clinton‚Äôs campaign manager, according to new emails released by WikiLeaks. 
Creamer, who allegedly spearheaded the dirty tricks for the Democrats, wasn‚Äôt just consulting for the Democratic National Committee, according to videos made by Project Veritas. He was sending people to provoke Trump at events. 
Creamer has thus become a red-hot issue in the campaign. And now it‚Äôs apparent he is close to Mook. That surprising detail came out Sunday morning when WikiLeaks posted hundreds more emails from John Podesta‚Äôs Gmail account. Podesta is Clinton‚Äôs campaign chairman whose account was hacked in March.

Hillary‚Äôs ‚ÄòRussian Hack‚Äô Hoax: The Biggest Lie of This Election Season,"November 1, 2016 By 21wire 4 Comments 
Patrick Henningsen 21st Century Wire 
The longer this soap opera drags on, it‚Äôs becoming more and more evident that the Russian government did not ‚Äòhack‚Äô into the DNC, and Moscow is not feeding John Podesta‚Äôs emails to Wikileaks. For those who are deeply invested in this now official conspiracy theory, this might be a hard pill to swallow. 
The White House and the Hillary Clinton campaign are now married to the idea that ‚ÄòPutin is hacking the US elections.‚Äô In response, the President is weighing his options ‚Äì tougher economic sanctions, revoking diplomatic status to Russian envoys in the US, or even deploying his newly developed ‚Äòmalicious cyber-activity‚Äô tools. 
Even VP Joe Biden wants in on the action, threatening Moscow by saying,‚ÄùWe‚Äôre sending a message. We have the capacity to do it.‚Äù 
It seems that where ever you turn nowadays, someone in Washington is issuing a threat against Russia. Are US-Russian relations really that bad, or does this trend have more to do with the defense industry and power struggles within the US? 
What was previously a stance reserved for right-wing neoconservative hawks and Cold War hold-outs has now infected America‚Äôs left-wing, and is a firm plank in the Democratic Party platform, as evidenced by Hillary Clinton‚Äôs constant anti-Russian rhetoric throughout this 2016 election cycle. Along with the White House, Clinton has now transformed the Democrats into the vanguard of Washington‚Äôs new anti-Russia movement. 
On July 27th, Josh Rogin from the Washington Post wrote, ‚ÄúThe Clinton campaign has decided to escalate its rhetoric on Russia. After Trump suggested Wednesday that if Russia had indeed hacked Clinton‚Äôs private email server it should release the emails, the Clinton campaign sent out its Democratic surrogates to bash Russia and Trump in a manner traditionally reserved for Republicans.‚Äù 
Anyone who was paying attention back then knew this ‚ÄòRussian hack‚Äô talking point was purely political, but then again, who‚Äôs really paying attention these days? Certainly not the US media. 
You can trace the genesis of the Democratic Party‚Äôs hardcore anti-Russian strategy back to when President Vladimir Putin made a mild passing remark about Donald Trump‚Äôs GOP primary success. From that point on, Trump‚Äôs political opponents saw this as an open target. In their words, ‚Äòcomparing one dictator to another.‚Äô 
Never one to pass up an opportunity to score cheap political points, President Obama got in on the act, intensifying the Trump-Putin narrative to the level of bromance . ‚ÄúIf you‚Äôve made a career out of idealizing Ronald Reagan, then where were you when your own party‚Äôs nominee for president was kissing up to Vladimir Putin?‚Äù said Obama on Oct 20th at a Clinton rally in Miami. 
Backed by the Obama White House, Clinton and the media felt they had a green light to keep pressing ahead with blaming Russia ‚Äì not only for the controversial DNC leaks, but also for hacking into US election systems in Arizona ‚Äì a charge devoid of any evidence other than innuendo and speculation. The media‚Äôs coverage on this issue was deceptive from the onset. In a leading news release, entitled, ‚Äú Russian hackers targeted Arizona election system ,‚Äù we can see how after the cock-sure headline, the first paragraph would always sound definitive: 
‚ÄúHackers targeted voter registration systems in Illinois and Arizona, and the FBI alerted Arizona officials in June that Russians were behind the assault on the election system in that state.‚Äù 
But then by the time you advanced down the story, the report would quickly retreat into a zone of uncertainty: 
‚ÄúThe bureau described the threat as ‚Äúcredible‚Äù and significant, ‚Äúan eight on a scale of one to 10,‚Äù Matt Roberts, a spokesman for Arizona Secretary of State Michele Reagan (R), said Monday. As a result, Reagan shut down the state‚Äôs voter registration system for nearly a week.‚Äù 
And then, down to almost nothing‚Ä¶ 
‚ÄúIt turned out that the hackers had not compromised the state system or even any county system. They had, however, stolen the username and password of a single election official in Gila County.‚Äù 
At no point was any evidence ever given. Only ambiguous statements like, ‚ÄúCyber security officials agree that this looks very much like a Russian government-directed hack.‚Äù 
Are American politicians so callous as to tempt geopolitical conflict in order to further their short-term political ambitions? Better yet, has American political life really arrived in such a dark cul de sac (translated in French: ‚Äòbottom of the bag‚Äô) where politicians in power are so insecure as to make-up and propagate wild international conspiracy theories ‚Äì in the middle a national election cycle? It‚Äôs a very depressing prospect, and yet, this is exactly what we are seeing in this 2016 Presidential Election. 
Behind Clinton‚Äôs wild hyperbolic rants about the Kremlin and Wikileaks, you will find the White House‚Ä¶ 
On October 7th, the Obama Administration formally accused the Russian government of stealing emails from the Democratic National Committee and other high-profile individuals including Hillary Clinton‚Äôs campaign manager John Podesta ‚Äì giving them to Wikileaks. 
Soon, there was a queue of ‚Äònational security‚Äô politicians eager to hitch a ride on this bandwagon. Senator Ben Sasse (NE-R), a member of the Homeland Security Committee spouted out, ‚ÄúRussia must face serious consequences. Moscow orchestrated these hacks because [Russian President Vladimir] Putin believes Soviet-style aggression is worth it. The United States must upend Putin‚Äôs calculus with a strong diplomatic, political, ¬≠cyber and economic response.‚Äù 
According to a Washington Post report by technology editor, Ellen Nakashima , the only ‚Äòevidence‚Äô that seems to be available on this story is a corporate analysis of the alleged ‚ÄòRussian government hacks‚Äô‚Äì provided by a US cyber security company called Crowdstrike . No actual specifics are given, so we are meant to take private firm Crowdstrike‚Äôs word for it. 
IMAGE: Crowdstrike cyber security. 
The Post‚Äôs Nakashima then added: 
‚ÄúThe administration also blamed Moscow for the hack of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee and the subsequent leak of private email addresses and cellphone numbers of Democratic lawmakers.‚Äù 
An online persona calling himself Guccifer 2.0 has claimed responsibility for posting the material. Those sites and that persona are ‚Äúconsistent with the methods and motivations of Russian-directed efforts,‚Äù the joint statement said. ‚Äú‚Ä¶ We believe, based on the scope and sensitivity of these efforts, that only Russia‚Äôs senior-most officials could have authorized these activities.‚Äù 
Moscow‚Äôs press secretary‚Äôs reply: ‚ÄúThis is some sort of nonsense,‚Äù said Dmitry Peskov. 
Despite the constant repetition by Democrat media surrogates, and as CNN‚Äôs Maria Cardona said last night, no US national intelligence agency has really ‚Äúconfirmed‚Äù that Russia was behind the email hacks ‚Äì and still no evidence , other than speculative guesswork, has been presented. 
Likewise, US intelligence agencies have never actually said definitively on record that ‚ÄúRussia did it,‚Äù thus, leaving the door open to walk-back the accusation at a later date. Standard Washington procedure of ambiguity. This little detail doesn‚Äôt seem to matter in this hyperbolic political climate though. It seems that the White House, Hillary Clinton and media operatives like Cardona ‚Äì are quite happy living in what John Kerry recent dubbed as a ‚Äò parallel universe .‚Äô 
Still, during the final Presidential debate, Hillary Clinton proudly crowed how ‚Äú 17 US intelligence agencies ‚Äù aka the ‚ÄúIntelligence Community‚Äù‚Äì all agreed that Russia did it. 
The announcement, albeit vague, actually originated from the Office of the Director of National Intelligence. 
‚ÄúWe have 17 intelligence agencies, civilian and military, who have all concluded that these espionage attacks, these cyberattacks, come from the highest levels of the Kremlin, and they are designed to influence our election,‚Äù said Clinton. ‚ÄúI find that deeply disturbing.‚Äù 
What‚Äôs even more disturbing is the fact that Clinton is lying in front of a national audience. The highest levels of the Kremlin? Here are Clinton‚Äôs ‚Äô17 agencies‚Äô: 
Air Force Intelligence, Army Intelligence, Central Intelligence Agency, Coast Guard Intelligence, Defense Intelligence Agency, Energy Department, Homeland Security Department, State Department, Treasury Department, Drug Enforcement Administration, Federal Bureau of Investigation, Marine Corps Intelligence, National Geospatial Intelligence Agency, National Reconnaissance Office, National Security Agency, Navy Intelligence and the Office of the Director of National Intelligence. 
What does the Coast Guard Intelligence, National Geospatial Intelligence Agency or the Drug Enforcement Administration know about John Podesta‚Äôs emails? Answer: nothing. 
The exact same thing happened following Wikileaks first trove of DNC emails back in July 2016 . The US government issued a vague accusatory statement, but would not actually name the culprit. Some might call that propaganda. 
In both instances, the Obama Administration refused to present any evidence. Translated: there was no evidence. If there had been, the White House would have been shouting from the rooftops and using it as leverage to apply muscle in the UN over Washington‚Äôs flagging efforts in Syria. Both Obama Administration announcements were nothing more than dog whistles for Democrats and ‚Äújournalists‚Äù working for hopelessly partisan outlets like New York Times and CNN ‚Äì none of whom have bothered to press the White House for one ounce of evidence pertaining to the Party‚Äôs decree that ‚ÄúRussian is hacking the US election process.‚Äù If you actually look at the joint DNI-DHS statement issued on the matter, it contains no definitive statement: ‚Äú‚Ä¶ [the hacks] are consistent with the methods and motivations of Russian-directed efforts. These thefts and disclosures are intended to interfere with the US election process. Such activity is not new to Moscow ‚Äî the Russians have used similar tactics and techniques across Europe and Eurasia, for example, to influence public opinion there. We believe, based on the scope and sensitivity of these efforts, that only Russia‚Äôs senior-most officials could have authorized these activities.‚Äù According to NSA intelligence worker-turned whistleblower William Binney , when asked about WikiLeaks and whether the Russians are ‚Äòhacking‚Äô US elections, he concluded that the cyber efforts against the DNC were more likely to be the work of a ‚Äú disgruntled U.S. intelligence worker. ‚Äù 
Under partisan pressure from senior Democrat Senator Harry Reid , the FBI also initiated another investigation into ‚Äúpeople linked to the Trump team with Russia.‚Äù Reid was unset about the DNC hacks and the Podesta emails and demanded the FBI do something about the Trump campaign. To date, the FBI haven‚Äôt come up with anything. 
To be fair, Hillary would have every reason to believe that the Kremlin is behind the hack ‚Äì because her staff read it to her from the campaign‚Äôs daily intelligence briefings, presumably, supplied from the US government‚Äôs much vaunted Intelligence Community . Of course, that‚Äôs the same Intelligence Community that briefed George W Bush about Saddam‚Äôs nonexistent nuclear weapons program, and who also briefed Colin Powell about Iraq‚Äôs imaginary ‚ÄúWinnebagos of Death‚Äù aka mobile anthrax labs disguised as senior double-wide camper vans. So, of course, they would know if Putin directed the DNC leaks and Podesta email hacks. 
For those us who are skeptical of the great oxymoron known as ‚ÄòWashington Intelligence,‚Äô I can almost hear the mainstream rebuttal now, ‚ÄúNo, that was Iraq, that was Bush. We‚Äôre not like that. No, this time it‚Äôs different. This time we are sure the Russians did it!‚Äù 
In 2014, Obama claimed that Kim‚Äôs notorious ‚ÄúBureau 121‚Äù hacked into Sony Pictures. 
This isn‚Äôt the first time that President Obama has cried wolf on a foreign ‚Äòhack‚Äô and then tried to sell it for political purposes. Back in December 2014, Obama claimed that North Korea had hacked Sony Pictures in Hollywood. Pentagon-CIA media proxy CNN quickly chimed in to support Washington‚Äôs conspiracy theory, floating a colorful story that Kim Jing-Un had deployed a secret underground hacking unit called ‚Äò Bureau 121 .‚Äô Just like with today‚Äôs ‚ÄúRussian Hack‚Äù theory, no member of the mainstream press dared to question the White House‚Äôs ridiculous North Korean claim, and like the ‚ÄòRussian Hack‚Äô claims, the only source cited for Sony hack was analysis provided by US firm Crowdstrike . 
Jumping the Shark 
After their Democratic Party Convention on July 27th, the Clinton campaign machine put all of its chips on their Putin narrative. 
Soon after, a cadre of top Clinton national security surrogates then accused Trump of emboldening Russia in their evil plot to ‚Äúdestabilize and dominate the West.‚Äù Tom Donilon, a former national security adviser then accused Russia of ‚Äòinterfering‚Äô with elections all over Europe and then accused Trump is helping Russia directly. At that point, they were in too deep to turn back. The biggest impact of @wikileaks ? Shining a spotlight on Russia‚Äôs attempt to undermine American democracy and Trump‚Äôs refusal to condemn it https://t.co/ALzpYm1Bb5 
‚Äî Josh Schwerin (@JoshSchwerin) October 21, 2016 
Clinton spin doctors Josh Schwerin and Michael Fallon would stoop even lower by accusing RT of having possession of the Podesta emails even before Wikileaks did. Their only ‚Äòevidence‚Äô seemed to be Twitter posts by RT News which Clinton held up as ‚Äòproof‚Äô that the Kremlin was front-running Wikileaks email dumps. The Clinton braintrust failed to note that the Podesta emails were posted on Wikileaks own website well before RT News had tweeted about them. At that point it became obvious that the Clinton campaign was panicking and hysterically grabbing for any excuse they could get their hands on. We then watched, as one RT reporter after another dismantled the Clinton campaign‚Äôs desperate claims. It was embarrassing. 
They could not face the uncomfortable fact that it was WikiLeaks head Julian Assange who chose the timing of the release of the DNC and Podesta emails. Rather than attack Assange himself, who happens to be popular with millennials (the very group Clinton struggles to connect with), her operatives opted to target Russia and Trump instead. 
Either way, the political strategy here is clear ‚Äì to shoot the messenger . The Clinton campaign is stuck in permanent rear-guard mode, because based on the content of both the DNC Leaks, Wikileaks files, and Project Veritas video ‚Äì their own Democratic Party has been discredited and exposed as a corrupt political organization. 
Their other big problem is that despite all the outrage from Democrats and their mainstream media surrogates, none of the leaked content has been challenged on the basis of its authenticity. The results speak for themselves. The initial DNC leak of 20,000 emails resulted in the resignation of DNC Chairwoman Debbie Wasserman Schultz . They revealed the unthinkable: the Democratic National Committee actively worked to undermine the Presidential campaign of Bernie Sanders in favor of the establishment choice in Hillary Clinton. Sanders never had a chance. Honest commentators called this an affront to the democratic process, while party insiders and Clinton supporters pretended to be aloof as if it never happened. 
To prove this point, both President Obama and Hillary Clinton then gave Wasserman-Schultz a glowing endorsement on the way out. ‚ÄúFor the last eight years, Chairwoman Debbie Wasserman Schultz has had my back. This afternoon, I called her to let her know that I am grateful,‚Äù said Obama. Not surprisingly, Clinton thanked Wasserman Schultz, presumably for helping to knock her only competitor Sanders out of the Democrat primary race. ‚ÄúI am grateful to Debbie for getting the Democratic Party to this year‚Äôs historic convention in Philadelphia, and I know that this week‚Äôs events will be a success thanks to her hard work and leadership,‚Äù said Clinton. 
The party had sold its soul to devil and no one seemed to care too much about it. 
Party Meltdown 
Wasserman Schultz‚Äôs replacement didn‚Äôt fair much better. DNC Vice Chairwoman Donna Brazile was installed to serve as interim chair through the remainder election, but Brazile was soon skewered by subsequent Wikileaks batches ‚Äì showing how, on more than one occasion, she fed debate questions obtained from corrupt mainstream media operatives ‚Äì straight to Hillary Clinton. 
‚Äú A March 12 email exchange shows Brazile stating that she received a town hall question from Roland Martin, a TV One host who co-moderated a March 13 town hall with CNN‚Äôs Jake Tapper.‚Äù 
‚Äú A March 5 email shows that she shared a question with Clinton campaign chairman John Podesta and communications director Jennifer Palmieri that was to be asked in a March 6 debate hosted by CNN in Flint, Mich.‚Äù (Source: Daily Caller ) 
Brazile‚Äôs audacious fraud also helped contribute to her party‚Äôs planned sabotage of Democrat challenger Bernie Sanders. Watch Brazile go into full meltdown when confronted here: 
. Completely corrupt and still, Brazile even had to temerity to deny doing it when pressed on FOX News last week. Brazile‚Äôs reputation is so bad now that even CNN has severed ties with her ‚Äì and that‚Äôs saying a lot. 
In addition, it was also revealed how CNN‚Äôs head political commentator, Gloria Borger , was named by Podesta as one of a shortlist of ‚Äòjournalists‚Äô the Clinton campaign would ‚Äúwork with‚Äù to gain favorable coverage. You‚Äôd think that CNN would have dropped Borger after this was revealed, but no. Amazingly, Borger is still leading CNN‚Äôs election coverage. 
Clearly, CNN cannot be trusted to police itself when it comes to matters of outright collusion with Hillary Clinton and the Democratic Party. Ever-unbiased CNN's Gloria Borger refers to being in ""GOP hell"" and says she'll ""reach out soon"" to Podesta. Heart-warming #PodestaEmails13 pic.twitter.com/CQFdcJ12Q5

Worse Than Watergate 
Perhaps a bigger scandal which the Obama White House and Clinton campaign operatives would like to bury ‚Äì is the FBI‚Äôs investigation into the Clinton Foundation. Yesterday, the Wall Street Journal confirmed the existence of an internal feud between the FBI and the Justice Department, over whether or not to pursue an investigation into Clinton issue: 
‚ÄúSome investigators grew frustrated, viewing FBI leadership as uninterested in probing the charity, these people said. Others involved disagreed sharply, defending FBI bosses and saying Mr. McCabe in particular was caught between an increasingly acrimonious fight for control between the Justice Department and FBI agents pursuing the Clinton Foundation case. It isn‚Äôt unusual for field agents to favor a more aggressive approach than supervisors and prosecutors think is merited. But the internal debates about the Clinton Foundation show the high stakes when such disagreements occur surrounding someone who is running for president.‚Äù 
There‚Äôs more. It was also revealed last week how Jill McCabe, the wife of FBI Deputy Director, Andrew McCabe , received $467,500 in campaign funds in late 2015 for her Virginia State Senate run. This unusually large donation came via a political action committee run by Virginia Gov.Terry McAuliffe ‚Äì a Clinton Foundation board member. After the funds were donated, Andrew McCabe was then put in charge of the Clinton Email case. In normal times, this one scandal would be bigger than Watergate, but these are not normal times . 
So why is Washington going all out to deflect to Russia , and cover-up the Clinton scandals, and the Wikileaks document dumps? One reason is because the Clinton email issue goes all the way to the top ‚Äì to the President himself. 
What 21WIRE reported on Oct 21st is how President Obama lied when first confronted about whether or not he knew about the existence of Hillary‚Äôs unauthorized private server. Obama told CBS News on March 7, 2015 that he only found out about Clinton‚Äôs server ‚Äúthe same time everybody else learned it through news reports.‚Äù The President‚Äôs lie was confirmed when newly released FBI documents showed that: 
‚ÄúObama used a pseudonym [bobama@ameritech.net] when communicating with then-Secretary of State Hillary Clinton by email, and at least one of those emails ended up on Clinton‚Äôs private email server.‚Äù 
So, not only did Obama lie on national TV, but he also broke strict White House security protocols by carelessly exchanging private emails ‚Äúoff grid‚Äù with Hillary Clinton on a unsecured and unauthorized mail server ‚Äì maybe to avoid the same scrutiny one would have on a government system. Who knows why he did it. 
Sure, he‚Äôs not the first US President to lie, but like, Richard Nixon and Bill Clinton, Obama just joined that exclusive liars club ‚Äì caught out lying to the American people. 
On top of this, any communications made by the President of the United States are de facto labeled as ‚Äú born classified .‚Äù The same goes for any State Department communications with other foreign ministers. 
COVER-UP: John Podesta and Huma Abedin on the Hillary campaign jet (Image: ABC News ) 
It should be well known by now after watching both Attorney Generals Eric Holder and Loretta Lynch in action ‚Äì that the Obama Justice Department (DOJ) is one of the most politicized in history. Bear that in mind when looking at the latest leg of the Hillary Email case. 
On Friday, FBI Director James Comey set the election alight after announcing that the FBI would be reopening the Clinton email case ‚Äì currently examining 650,000 emails found while investigating a laptop belonging to former US Congressman Anthony Weiner (estranged husband of top Clinton aid and long-time confidant Huma Abedin) who was snared in a ‚Äòsexting‚Äô scandal, allegedly involving a underaged female. So which DOJ person is in charge of this investigation? None other than Assistant Attorney General Peter J. Kadzik . Who is Kadzik? Zero Hedge reports: 
‚ÄúOh yes. Recall our post from last week, ‚Äú Clinton Campaign Chair Had Dinner With Top DOJ Official One Day After Hillary‚Äôs Benghazi Hearing ‚Äù in which we reported that John Podesta had dinner with one of the highest ranked DOJ officials the very day after Hillary Clinton‚Äôs Benghazi testimony? It was Peter Kadzik.‚Äù 
Oh, and if that wasn‚Äôt good enough, Kadzik was also Podesta‚Äôs lawyer back in 1998 when Ken Starr was investigating Podesta over his role in helping Bill Clinton intern/mistress Monica Lewinsky land a job at the United Nations. The two were described as ‚Äòbest friends.‚Äô FOX News confirms: 
‚ÄúFantastic lawyer. Kept me out of jail,‚Äù Podesta wrote on Sept. 8, 2008 to Obama aide Cassandra Butts, according to emails hacked from Podesta‚Äôs Gmail account and posted by WikiLeaks. 
To call the Clinton circle incestuous would be an understatement, and on the whole, Americans are sick of it. 
Russia ‚Äì The Party Scapegoat 
Former Democratic Party leader Howard Dean was so incensed about the FBI reopening the case, he accused the FBI director of being in league with Russia, Tweeting: ‚ÄúIronically Comey put himself on the same side as Putin.‚Äù Ironically Comey put himself on the same side as Putin. 
‚Äî Howard Dean (@GovHowardDean) October 29, 2016 
Another veteran party operative and lifetime Clinton defender, James Carville , was so upset by the FBI announcement that he accused ‚Äúthe KGB‚Äù working with Republicans to ‚Äúhijack the election‚Äù during his wild rant on MSNBC . 
‚ÄúI think this an outrage and I think the fact that the KGB is involved in this election is an outrage and I think the American people ought to take their democracy back regardless of what the press wants to do and the excuses they want to make for Comey. That‚Äôs what I think,‚Äù said Carville. 
Maybe someone can remind Carville that there is no KGB , and that the Soviet Union actually dissolved in 1991. 
These are just a few scandals surrounding the Democratic Party and the Clinton campaign, along with the many expos√©s revealed through Wikileaks, and the Podesta email batches. Those are actual scandals with real tangible evidence ‚Äì unlike the ‚ÄòRussians hacking the DNC and John Podesta and passing those to Wikileaks.‚Äô 
Suffice to say, the Democratic Party machine has already demonstrated that it is prepared to say anything in order to deflect and divert attention away from the damning Wikileaks material, and also blame Donald Trump in the process. It should be obvious by now that in their desperation to push a highly comprised Hillary Clinton over the finish line on November 8th, the Washington establishment has concocted the story that ‚ÄòPutin is trying to influence our electoral process in the US.‚Äô They‚Äôve tried to lay this at the feet of Donald Trump, who Obama and Clinton claim has some secret special relationship with Vladimir Putin. The liberal mainstream media have made a meal out of this talking point, and anti-Russian war hawks on the Republican side love it too. For the White House and the Clinton campaign this seemed like the ultimate clean sweep ‚Äì a perfect double entendre . 
The geopolitical strategy behind this move was twofold. First, this non event would be used to advance immediate calls for sanctions against Russia. Secondly, the US could continue to lean on Russia in the UN over Syria. Previously, 21WIRE reported how Washington‚Äôs State Dept and UN delegations, led by the dynamic trio of John Kerry , Samantha Power , and John Kirby , already lied when levelling charges against Russia for war crimes in Aleppo, and again while accusing Russia and Syria of conducting an airstrike on a UN Aid Convoy in Syria. As we have already shown ‚Äì that raid was most likely a ground attack carried out of US-backed ‚Äòrebels‚Äô Al Nusra Front, or Nour al-Din al-Zenki. 
With so much at stake geopolitically, why would Washington lie about a potential World War III trigger event? If they are prepared to lie about this, what else are they prepared to lie about? 
The demonization of all things Russian has definitely accelerated since late 2013 when the US engineered a coup d‚Äôetat in Kiev, Ukraine. Ever since that it‚Äôs been a go-to talking point for ginning-up and new transaltlantic arms race, as with Republican war hawks ‚Äì and a convenient scapegoat for any politician requiring misdirection, like Clinton and the Democrats. When the new year rang in 2015, the newly appointed head of the U.S. Broadcasting Board of Governors, Andrew Lack, announced the new challenges facing America‚Äôs own state-run media arm that includes U.S. overseas propaganda assets including Voice of America, Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty, the Middle East Broadcasting Networks and Radio Free Asia. Lack said , ‚ÄúWe are facing a number of challenges from entities like Russia Today which is out there pushing a point of view, the Islamic State in the Middle East and groups like Boko Haram,‚Äù He was forced to resign shortly after that. 
What‚Äôs clear is that when it comes to all things Russian, there is an established pattern of compulsive lying by this US Administration. The list is too long to chronicle here, although ‚Äò Russian-backed Rebles Shootting Down MH17 ,‚Äô and ‚Äò Assad Regime Sarin Attack in Damascus in 2013 ‚Äò certainly comes to mind. 
That said, it‚Äôs hard to imagine a lie as egregious and potentially destructive than one which accuses the Russia government, a world nuclear power and member of the UNSC, of ‚ÄòHacking Into the US Electoral Process.‚Äô When you examine history however, what you will find is plenty of evidence documenting exactly how the US government and the CIA have altered and flipped 100 foreign elections throughout history, the attempted assassination of over 50 foreign leaders . Knowing all this, one might find it hard to take seriously Washington‚Äôs claims that Putin and Trump are trying manipulate the 2016 Election 
On Oct 9, 2016, Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov laid it all on the table: 
‚ÄúWe have witnessed a fundamental change of circumstances when it comes to the aggressive Russophobia that now lies at the heart of U.S. policy towards Russia. It‚Äôs not just a rhetorical Russophobia, but aggressive steps that really hurt our national interests and pose a threat to our security.‚Äù 
Self-serving, career political operatives in Washington are playing a dangerous game. History will mark this as one of the biggest political follies of the Obama-Clinton era. 
Knowing what we now know about the NSA and its ability to hack and grab any email or text message from anyone, anywhere ‚Äì if Washington really wanted to know where the hacks came from, maybe they could start there. Far be it from anyone in Washington or the media to ever adopt that line of inquiry. 
Still, we‚Äôre waiting for the emergence of an adult in the room in Washington ‚Äì before it‚Äôs too late.

"PARTNERS IN CRIME: Goldman Sachs, The Clintons & Wall Street","November 3, 2016 By Shawn Helton 1 Comment 
Shawn Helton 21st Century Wire 
The cozy relationship between Goldman Sachs and the Clintons has reached dizzying new heights in recent years, giving the Democratic Party nominee Hillary Clinton an immensely influential partner on Wall Street. 
As the public and most of the mainstream media is still processing the political bombshell concerning the newly reopened FBI probe into the Hillary Clinton ‚Äôs email server case ‚Äì the global investment banking firm Goldman Sachs quietly endorsed the Democratic presidential candidate this past week. 
The financial ties that bind the Clintons and Wall Street banks like Goldman Sachs are nothing new, but never before have the connections been so exposed. Let‚Äôs take a trip down collusion lane to review some of the more questionable examples of their political and financial merger formed long ago‚Ä¶ 
‚ÄòMONEY CHANGERS‚Äô‚Äì Wall Street‚Äôs Goldman Sachs are inextricably linked to the Clinton‚Äôs and The Clinton Foundation. (Photo illustration 21WIRE) 
The Clintons & Goldman Sachs 
While campaigning for his first term in the White House, former president Bill Clinton received an enormous amount of support from Washington insider lobbyists and investment banking firms on Wall Street. 
At the top of the pile sat Goldman Sachs‚Ä¶ 
In 1992, the LA Times reported that presidential nominee Bill Clinton,‚Äù received the largest share of his financial support‚Äìat least $2.6 million‚Äìfrom lawyers and lobbyists,‚Äù and that Clinton also received additional support from ‚Äú‚Ä¶big securities firms such as Goldman, Sachs & Co. in New York and Stephens Inc. in his hometown of Little Rock, Ark. In fact, Goldman Sachs employees and their family members were responsible for the biggest contributions from a single firm: $98,700.‚Äù 
For decades the Clintons have remained close allies to the banking behemoth Goldman Sachs and in the process, a mutually beneficial relationship has taken hold, something that even the NY Times admits: 
‚ÄúOver 20-plus years, Goldman provided the Clintons with some of their most influential advisers, millions of dollars in campaign contributions and speaking fees, and financial support for the family foundation‚Äôs charitable programs.‚Äù 
By now, there should be little doubt that the Clinton political machine is a wholly owned subsidiary of the Wall Street banking cartel. Their relationship was built over three decades. 
The real watershed moment came here‚Ä¶ 
BLANK CHECK: Bill Clinton laughs with Wall Street elites after signing the Financial Services Modernization Act in 1999. 
‚ÄòKey to the Kingdom‚Äô 
In one of the most significant financial rulings in the modern era, the Clinton presidency gave big banks like Goldman Sachs the skeleton key to the kingdom by deregulating the investment banking system almost entirely. 
The Clinton/Goldman Sachs/Wall Street partnership was fully forged after the removal of the Glass-Steagall Act , which banking luminaries cynically named the ‚Äú Financial Services Modernization Act of 1999‚Ä≥ officially titled the Gramm- Leach-Bliley Act . The original Glass-Steagall was a depression-age four-part provision under the Bank Act of 1933 that strictly prohibited securities activities that could be harmful to investors ‚Äì the same sort of rogue speculating and paper fiat fraud which triggered the Great Depression (1929-1941). In fact, the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act which repealed Glass-Steagall, opened the door for the ‚Äòshadow banking‚Äô realm outside of regulatory oversight which led to a much higher trading risk, as banks became more interlinked. 
Simply put: Clinton‚Äôs repeal of Glass-Steagell removed the firewall between speculative investment banking and regular high street retail and consumer banking ‚Äì which exposed everyone to toxic, subprime ponzi schemes and fake paper products being pushed around the globe by the banking elite ‚Äì which ultimately causing the global economy to crash in 2008. All that can be laid at the feet of one William Jefferson Clinton. And Hillary still claims that, ‚ÄúMy husband did so well with the economy.‚Äù Really? 
In a cross-posted article featured at Huffington Post , Nomi Prins underscored the complicit nature of Wall Street and Washington after the removal of tighter bank regulations under the Clinton administration during the 1990‚Äôs: 
‚ÄúTo grasp the dangers that the Big Six banks (JPMorgan Chase, Citigroup, Bank of America, Wells Fargo, Goldman Sachs, and Morgan Stanley) presently pose to the financial stability of our nation and the world, you need to understand their history in Washington, starting with the Clinton years of the 1990s. Alliances established then (not exclusively with Democrats, since bankers are bipartisan by nature) enabled these firms to become as politically powerful as they are today and to exert that power over an unprecedented amount of capital. Rest assured of one thing: their past and present CEOs will prove as critical in backing a Hillary Clinton presidency as they were in enabling her husband‚Äôs years in office.‚Äù 
Prins herself was a former managing director at Goldman Sachs, senior managing director at Bear Stearns, as well as having worked as a senior strategist at the now defunct investment banking firm Lehman Brothers. Following the financial crash in 2007-2008, Prins blew the whistle on the banking world in a book entitled ‚Äú It Takes a Pillage : Behind the Bonuses, Bailouts, and Backroom Deals from Washington to Wall Street.‚Äù 
Prins has become an advocate for the reinstatement of the Glass-Steagall Act since departing from the investment banking world. 
The media outlet Common Dreams described the merger between Citicorp and Travelers Group (becoming Citigroup), which was dubbed the ‚ÄòCiti-Travelers Act‚Äô on Capitol Hill. It was a conglomeration that went hand in hand with the Clinton administration‚Äôs influence on banking deregulation marked by the repeal of Glass-Steagall: 
‚ÄúThen, in 1998, in an act of corporate civil disobedience, Citicorp and Travelers Group announced they were merging. Such a combination of banking and insurance companies was illegal under the Bank Holding Company Act , but was excused due to a loophole that provided a two-year review period of proposed mergers. The merger was premised on the expectation that Glass-Steagall would be repealed. Citigroup‚Äôs co-chairs Sandy Weill and John Reed led a swarm of industry executives and lobbyists who trammeled the halls of Congress to make sure a deal was cut.‚Äù 
At the time, it was the largest financial merger even though it was technically illegal , as stated by the former Bankers of America CEO Kenneth Guenther . In 1999 , after ‚Äú12 attempts in 25 years,‚Äù Congress passed the Financial Services Modernization Act , which led to the repeal of Glass-Steagall. 
The repeal of Glass-Steagall was pushed heavily by Citigroup‚Äôs co-CEO Sanford Weill and lobbyist Roger Levy and according to a report by The Nation : 
‚ÄúThey laid out more than $290 million for lobbying in 1998, according to the Center for Responsive Politics, and donated more than $150 million in the 1997‚Äì98 election cycle‚Äîa figure sure to be topped in 1999‚Äì2000.‚Äù 
How much of those contributions made their way to the Clinton family and what kind of impact did this have after they left the White House? 
In 2005, Bill Clinton was paid over half a million for speaking at three private Goldman events. 
In 2013, after stepping down from her position as Secretary of State, Hillary Clinton gave a total of three paid speeches at Goldman Sachs events to the tune of $675,000 dollars, in which one attendee said ‚Äús he sounded more like a Goldman Sachs managing director,‚Äù according to a quote obtained by Politico . Indeed, Clinton gave a glowing speech to the Goldman gang and in the process, as Wikileaks released in early October , the Democratic nominee believes in ‚Äúboth a public and a private position‚Äù on Wall Street reform and that it is an ‚Äú oversimplification‚Äù to suggest that investment banking led to the most recent financial crisis. 
That Clinton leak provided another window into the much protected alliance between finance and politics, but it‚Äôs only the tip of a much larger iceberg. 
In 2015, the Washington Post reported that ‚ÄúHillary Rodham Clinton and former president Bill Clinton earned in excess of $25 million for delivering 104 speeches since the beginning of 2014, a huge infusion to their net worth as she was readying for a presidential bid.‚Äù 
‚ÄòANOINTED‚Äô: Chelsea Clinton with Goldman Sachs-backed hedge funder Marc Mezvinsky. 
The Clinton family is chock-full of banking connections, as Chelsea Clinton ‚Äòjoined‚Äô the Avenue Capital Group, which according to reports is a ‚Äú‚Ä¶$12 billion hedge fund whose founder has contributed to many Democratic Party campaigns.‚Äù Chelsea is married to Marc Mezvinsky , a former investment banker for Goldman Sachs. Chelsea‚Äôs tenure at Avenue Capital Group was from 2006-2008 just prior to Hillary Clinton‚Äôs run for president in 2008. Since then Chelsea has risen to vice chairman inside the Clinton Foundation. 
Marc Mezvinsky was forced to close one of his hedge funds recently, Eaglevale Hellenic Opportunity , after had the fund lost most of its initial investor funds of $25 million ‚Äì after blowing the money on secondhand junk Greek bank stocks and toxic government debt. 
The apple doesn‚Äôt fall far from the tree‚Ä¶ 
As it turns out, Marc is the son of troubled former Congressman Ed Mezvinsky ‚Äì another close friend of Team Clinton. 
Politico reports on one of Ed Mezvinsky‚Äôs financial controversies in 1999: 
‚ÄúIn the waning days of Clinton‚Äôs presidency, federal prosecutors and the FBI were bearing down on former Rep. Ed Mezvinsky (D-Iowa), who had fallen for a series of Ponzi schemes and pulled in nearly $10 million money from other investors to cover his losses. ‚Äú 
Continuing, Politico outlined new information concerning a pardon request sent by from Ed Mezvinsky‚Äôs wife to then President Bill Clinton: 
‚Äú‚Ä¶records released last week by the Clinton Presidential Library in Little Rock and obtained by POLITICO show Mezvinsky and his then-wife ‚Äî ex-Rep. Marjorie Margolies-Mezvinsky (D-Pa.) ‚Äî pleaded with the former president for a presidential pardon to head off the looming federal case.‚Äù 
In 2016, the Daily Mail reported the following: ‚ÄúChelsea Clinton‚Äôs husband and his partners have suffered a huge loss after trying to bet on the revival of the Greek economy, and are now being forced to shut down one of their hedge funds. Marc Mezvinsky, 38, and his partners, former Goldman Sachs colleagues Bennett Grau and Mark Mallon, raised $25million from investors to buy up bank stocks and debt from the struggling nation. That fund however has lost 90 percent of its value, investors with direct knowledge of the situation told The New York Times , and will now be closed.‚Äù

The NY Times further outlined the long-held Clinton/Goldman connection just two years before the 2007-2008 financial crisis: ‚ÄúThe Clintons‚Äô relationships with Wall Street deepened in the 2000s, when Mr. Clinton set up his foundation in Harlem and Mrs. Clinton was elected to the Senate from New York. That brought her in close touch with the big Wall Street firms, a source of jobs and tax revenue for New York ‚Äî and a leading source of campaign funds for Mrs. Clinton. During her years in Congress, employees of Goldman donated in excess of $234,000 to Mrs. Clinton, more than those of any other company except Citigroup, according to the Center for Responsive Politics. Along with other New York politicians, Mrs. Clinton worked to obtain federal tax breaks to resuscitate Lower Manhattan after the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks, and those breaks helped Goldman build its new, roughly $2 billion headquarters. When it broke ground in 2005, Mrs. Clinton and other New York officials were on-site.‚Äù ‚ÄòHOW TO MONETIZE INFLUENCE‚Äô‚Äì Lloyd Blankfein at a Clinton Global Initiative event with Hillary Clinton. (Image Source: sputniknews ) The Wall Street Racket To understand who powers the Clinton Foundation‚Äôs billion dollar RICO influence-peddling slush fund, you need to understand how money is laundered between Wall Street and Washington DC. Goldman Sachs, JPMorgan Chase, Morgan Stanley, Bank of America and Citigroup and many others were all ordered to pay millions for misleading investors after the 2008 crash, then in April of 2016, Goldman was ordered to settle a federal and state probe for $5 Billion dollars. CNBC reported the following: 
‚ÄúGoldman Sachs will pay $5 billion to settle federal and state probes into the bank‚Äôs sale of mortgage-backed securities before the financial crisis, the Justice Department announced Monday. 
Authorities said Goldman misrepresented the quality of loans it securitized and then sold to investors ahead of the housing bubble and 2008 crisis. The settlement includes a $2.4 billion civil penalty, $1.8 billion in relief payouts to underwater homeowners and affected borrowers and $875 million to resolve various other claims. 
This resolution holds Goldman Sachs accountable for its serious misconduct in falsely assuring investors that securities it sold were backed by sound mortgages, when it knew that they were full of mortgages that were likely to fail,‚Äù acting Associate Attorney General Stuart Delery said in a statement .‚Äù 
In 2013, a Bloomberg article questioned how Goldman managed to survive and even thrive during the 2007-2008 economic crisis: 
‚ÄúWhether Goldman could have gone the way of Lehman Brothers or Merrill Lynch remains the subject of much debate. Goldman maintains that it did not need, or want, the $10 billion bailout that Hank Paulson [ former Goldman alum] pushed on it and other firms in October 2008. But the fact remains that when the Federal Reserve allowed Goldman and Morgan Stanley‚Äîbut not Lehman Brothers‚Äîto become bank holding companies on Sept. 21, 2008, Goldman was able, three days later, to raise $10 billion in equity, $5 billion from the public and another $5 billion from investor Warren Buffett. That would probably not have happened without the Fed‚Äôs expedited decision and support. (A week later, Morgan Stanley saved itself from bankruptcy when it negotiated a $9 billion equity investment from Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group.)‚Äù 
All told the Clinton friendly investment giant Goldman Sachs (after making record profits) became the fifth mega-bank ordered to pay billions to the Department of Justice after the financial crash of 2007-2008. In addition, the firm was ordered to pay $3 billion to the Federal Housing Finance Agency in 2014 ‚Äì not including pending private lawsuits levied on the firm since the Great Recession. 
In a New York Review article Goldman Sachs was already under investigation for committing fraud at least a year before the economic crash in 2007-2008: 
‚ÄúData gathered mostly from the Corporate Research Project , a public interest website, show that on thirteen occasions between 2009 and 2016, Goldman was penalized by US courts or government agencies for fraudulent or deceptive practices that were committed mostly between 2006 and 2009.‚Äù 
‚ÄòCASHING OUT‚Äô‚Äì Bill Clinton with his top economic strategist Robert Rubin. (Image Source: St. Louis Post-Dispatch ) 
Wall Street Selects ‚ÄòTeam Clinton‚Äô 
The Clinton connection to Goldman Sachs emerged in the early 1990‚Äôs as Robert Rubin , a former senior partner with Goldman (with a 26-year tenure with the firm), joined former President Clinton‚Äôs economic policy team, later becoming Secretary of the Treasury in 1995. Around that time, the Clinton presidency ushered in soaring tax hikes under the ‚ÄòRubinomics‚Äô banner (aka Clintonomics), the plan raised taxes on most Americans, specifically the middle class , in what was said to be the largest increase in American history at the time. 
According to Congressional record ( Vol.146 part 2 ), ‚ÄúIn 1995, the economy grew at a sickly 1.5% ‚Äì Clinton‚Äôs vetoes of spending cuts [insured] continued deficits well into the 21st Century.‚Äù 
In a Multinational Monitor report entitled ‚ÄúWall Street‚Äôs Best Investment: Ten Deregulatory Steps to Financial Meltdown,‚Äù by Robert Weissman and James Donahue , a clearer picture of the financial collusion spawned in the 1990‚Äôs under the Clinton administration was revealed: 
‚ÄúDuring the Clinton Administration, Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin, who had run Goldman Sachs, enthusiastically promoted the legislation. In a 1995 testimony before the House Banking Committee, for example, Rubin argued that ‚Äúthe banking industry is fundamentally different from what it was two decades ago, let alone in 1933. ‚Ä¶ U.S. banks generally engage in a broader range of securities activities abroad than is permitted domestically. Even domestically, the separation of investment banking and commercial banking envisioned by Glass-Steagall has eroded significantly.‚Äù 
With a pedigree that included Goldman Sachs, the Council on Foreign Relations (CFR), The Brookings Institution and the Bilderberg Group , Robert Rubin emerged in 1999 as the vice chairman at Citigroup (1999-2009) after overseeing its merger as well as helping to craft the repeal of Glass-Steagall while serving as Secretary of Treasury. Rubin made a fortune with Citigroup causing sharp criticism in media and from those within the financial sector following the 2007-2008 crash. Here‚Äôs a passage from Bloomberg regarding Rubin in the aftermath of the banking collapse: 
‚ÄúWhen it collapsed, due in part to bank-friendly policies that Rubin advocated, he made more than $100 million while others lost everything. ‚ÄúYou have to view people in a fair light,‚Äù says Phil Angelides, co-chair of the Financial Crisis Inquiry Commission, who credits Rubin for much of the Clinton-era prosperity. ‚ÄúBut on the other side of the ledger are key acts, such as the deregulation of derivatives, or stopping the Commodities Futures Trading Commission from regulating derivatives, that in the end weakened our financial system and exposed us to the risk of financial disaster.‚Äù

Under the Microscope 
Over the summer 21WIRE observed some curious connections between the Clinton Foundation and FBI director James Comey , as well as his questionable handling of other cases related to the Clinton family. Here‚Äôs the following passage to consider in light of the new information related to the Clinton investigation: 
‚ÄúMany will also be unaware that before Comey was installed by the Obama Administration as FBI Director, he was on the board of Director at HSBC Bank ‚Äì a bank implicated in international money laundering , including the laundering of billions on behalf of international drugs and narcotics trafficking cartels. Forbes also points out where Comey was also at the key choke-point during the case involving dodgy auditor KPMG which followed on by the HSBC criminal case: 
‚ÄúIf Comey, and his boss Attorney General Alberto Gonzalez, had made a different decision about KPMG back in 2005, KPMG would not have been around to miss all the illegal acts HSBC and Standard Chartered SCBFF +% were committing on its watch. Bloomberg reported in 2007 that back in June of 2005, Comey was the man thrust into the position of deciding whether KPMG would live or die for its criminal tax shelter violations.‚Äù 
In 2015, the Guardian discussed the financial relationship between HSBC and the Clinton Foundation receiving a startling $81 million in donations from clients of the large bank: 
‚ÄúThe charitable foundation run by Hillary Clinton and her family has received as much as $81m from wealthy international donors who were clients of HSBC‚Äôs controversial Swiss bank. 
Leaked files from HSBC‚Äôs Swiss banking division reveal the identities of seven donors to the Bill, Hillary and Chelsea Clinton Foundation with accounts in Geneva.‚Äù 
A new update on the FBI investigation into the Clinton Foundation was announced over the last 24 hours, in addition the recently reopened Clinton email probe from last week. It remains to be seen how in-depth this new investigation will be. 
To call it collusion would be an understatement. When looking back at the financial affairs of the Clintons, Goldman Sachs and others on Wall Street ‚Äì it‚Äôs clearer than ever that what we are looking at is a criminal syndicate.

"WikiLeaks: Hillary Clinton knew Saudi, Qatar were funding ISIS ‚Äì but still took their money for Foundation","
21st Century Wire says‚Ä¶ 
This should be the biggest revelation yet from WikiLeaks already epic email trove. Will the US media cover this story? 
Last night, in an RT Exclusive interview conducted by award-winning filmmaker John Pilger, WikiLeaks editor and founder Julian Assange described what he believes is ‚Äúthe most significant email in the whole collection.‚Äù 
WikiLeaks reveals an early 2014 email where the outgoing Secretary of State Hillary Clinton was urging John Podesta , then advisor to President Barack Obama, to ‚Äúbring pressure‚Äù on Gulf states Saudi Arabia and Qatar, ‚Äúwhich are providing clandestine financial and logistic support to ISIL [Islamic State, IS, ISIS] and other radical Sunni groups.‚Äù 
This constitutes proof that the Clinton Foundation knowingly accepting millions of dollars in ‚Äòcharitable‚Äô donations from the same Gulf states which both Secretary Clinton and President Obama knew were funding ISIS, Al Nusra Front (al Qaeda in Syria) and known takfiri terrorist fighting organizations. 
In addition, the Clinton‚Äôs Foundation took money from a number of other gulf monarchies: 
(Infographic: Conservative Post ) 
This latest news validates what 21WIRE has been saying since the ‚ÄòISIS crisis‚Äô began in June 2014. 
According to FOX News , FBI sources have said that ‚Äòindictments are likely‚Äô for the Clinton Foundation investigation. One only wonders how this latest Assange revelation will factor into the wider investigation ‚Äì as it goes right to the heart of the national security and foreign policy ‚Äì two things which Clinton trades heavily on in her campaigning. 
Assange went on to explain the deep ramifications of this latest criminal allegation against Clinton and her family foundation: 
‚ÄúAll serious analysts know, and even the US government has agreed, that some Saudi figures have been supporting ISIS and funding ISIS, but the dodge has always been that it is some ‚Äúrogue‚Äù princes using their oil money to do whatever they like, but actually the government disapproves. But that email says that it is the government of Saudi Arabia, and the government of Qatar that have been funding ISIS.‚Äù 
During their 25-minute interview filmed at the Ecuadorian Embassy in London, Assange and Pilger discussed the obvious conflict of interest between Clinton as Secretary of State, the Clinton Foundation and Gulf monarchies who financed them. The following is an excerpt from the interview transcript: 
John Pilger: The Saudis, the Qataris, the Moroccans, the Bahrainis, particularly the first two, are giving all this money to the Clinton Foundation, while Hillary Clinton is secretary of state, and the State Department is approving massive arms sales, particularly Saudi Arabia. 
Julian Assange: Under Hillary Clinton ‚Äì and the Clinton emails reveal a significant discussion of it ‚Äì the biggest-ever arms deal in the world was made with Saudi Arabia: more than $80 billion. During her tenure, the total arms exports from the US doubled in dollar value. 
JP: Of course, the consequence of that is that this notorious jihadist group, called ISIL or ISIS, is created largely with money from people who are giving money to the Clinton Foundation? 
JA: Yes.

Hillary Clinton Jumps the Shark with ‚ÄòTrump‚Äôs Secret Russian Server‚Äô Conspiracy Theory,"
21st Century Wire says‚Ä¶ 
Yesterday, WikiLeaks editor and founder Julian Assange confirmed what 21WIRE already knew ‚Äì that Hillary Clinton and the Obama White House‚Äôs claim of the US election process being ‚Äúhacked by the Russian government‚Äù was a desperate work of fiction. Not content with that fish tale, Hillary Clinton took the narrative to an embarrassing new low (if that was even possible) with another, wilder made-up conspiracy story about the Russians. 
The following statement made by Hillary Clinton yesterday epitomizes the term ‚Äú jumping the shark ‚Äú: It's time for Trump to answer serious questions about his ties to Russia. https://t.co/D8oSmyVAR4 pic.twitter.com/07dRyEmPjX 
‚Äî Hillary Clinton (@HillaryClinton) October 31, 2016 
Apparently, Hillary Clinton‚Äôs campaign staff fed her a planted online news story (by the Clinton campaign?) which ran on a questionable pro-Democratic Party online news outlet. On Monday, the Slate ran the story by one of its alleged ‚Äújournalists‚Äù named Franklin Foer , complete with a clickbait blog-like headline, ‚ÄúWas a Trump Server Communicating With Russia?‚Äù 
Whatever legitimacy the Slate had before last night, just evaporated. 
John Roberts from Forbes explains, ‚ÄúThe bottom line is that Slate screwed up by publishing this in the first place, and by adding more kooky misinformation to an already addled election season. As for Foer, he says on Twitter a ‚Äúfollow up‚Äù piece is in the works.‚Äù 
Roberts rightly points out that the only follow-up story for this lemon should start with the word ‚ÄúRETRACTION.‚Äù 
CYBER FEUD: Assange believes Clinton has gone beyond the pale with her Russian conspiracy obsession. 
During his exclusive interview with award-winning filmmaker John Pilger, when asked what he thought of Hillary Clinton‚Äôs shrill antics, Julian Assange said, ‚Äú ‚ÄúI actually feel quite sorry for Hillary Clinton as a person, because I see someone who is eaten alive by their ambitions, tormented literally to the point where they become sick.‚Äù 
The saddest thing about this and the other dishonest and destructive actions of the Clinton campaign and the Democratic Party ‚Äì is that no one in the party seems to see anything wrong with this level of deceit and dishonesty. Like Hillary Clinton in her sociopathic path to power, the party rank and file are acting like a cult coven following their high priestess. 
Still, Clinton surrogates in the media are trying to equate Clinton simultaneously scapegoating and baiting another nuclear superpower ‚Äì with a decade-old misogynist hot mic audio excerpt of Donald Trump in a TMZ-style tabloid sting. That pretty much sums up Democratic Party strategy for this election season. 
Assange was right. Clinton, the Democratic Party and their surrogate, are eating themselves. Such are the spoils of power in Washington that men and women will do and say anything to have it.

"KREMLIN: Putin Congratulates Trump, Hopes to Work Together Major Issues","
21st Century Wire says‚Ä¶ 
Over the past months, Hillary Clinton, the Obama White House and the mainstream media have been promoting the conspiracy theory that ‚Äú Russia is Hacking the US Election ‚Äù‚Äì blaming Moscow for the WikiLeaks emails, the DNC Leaks and for allegedly ‚Äòhacking‚Äô US voting systems. Despite the grand accusations, no evidence or proof has been offered by the US government. 
It goes without saying how damaging the Democratic Party‚Äôs crazed witch hunt has been to US-Russian relations, where Clinton has led the anti-Russian crusade, and demonizing president Vladimir Putin at every opportunity. 
Today‚Äôs stunning presidential victory by Donald Trump means that all eyes are now on Putin to see how Moscow and Washington will be interfacing going forward. 
With such sensitive geopolitical issues like Syria and the Ukraine currently in play, what happens between the two leaders over the coming months could set the tone going forward‚Ä¶ 
In a message to Donald Trump, Russian President Vladimir Putin has expressed confidence that the dialogue between Moscow and Washington, in keeping with each other‚Äôs views, meets the interests of both Russia and the US. 
Putin also expressed hope over the joint efforts on bringing Russian-American relations out of their current crisis. 
The Russian leader noted in the message that he hopes to address some ‚Äúburning issues that are currently on the international agenda, and search for effective responses to the challenges of the global security,‚Äù RIA Novosti reported. 
On top of it, Putin has expressed confidence that ‚Äúbuilding a constructive dialogue between Moscow and Washington, based on principles of equality, mutual respect and each other‚Äôs positions, meets the interests of the peoples of our countries and of the entire international community.‚Äù 
According to many observers, US-Russia relations are now at their lowest point since the Cold War. Putin has repeatedly noted that the worsening of Russia‚Äôs relations with the US ‚Äúwas not our choice,‚Äù however. 
For things to improve between Moscow and Washington, the US should first and foremost start acting like an equal partner and respect Russia‚Äôs interests rather than try to dictate terms, Putin said last month. 
‚ÄúWe are concerned with the deterioration of Russian-American relations, but that was not our choice, we never wanted that. On the contrary, we want to have friendly relations with the US, a great country and a leading economy,‚Äù Putin said at an economic forum in Moscow‚Ä¶

Mexico‚Äôs Richest Oligarch Loses Billions on News of Trump Victory,"
21st Century Wire says‚Ä¶ 
Mexico‚Äôs billionaire tycoon Carlos Slim saw a large chuck of his wealth evaporate ‚Äì literally overnight, after news of a Donald Trump election victory hit the currency and stock markets on Wednesday morning. 
According to Bloomberg financial analysts, Slim, Mexico‚Äôs wealthiest person and rated fifth on the global rich list, took a stinging $5.1 billion haircut after the Mexican Peso went into a 12% free fall after Trump‚Äôs stunning upset over Democratic Hillary Clinton. 
Slim‚Äôs loss amounted to a staggering 9.2 percent of his total fortune. 
In the week before, polls showed Hillary Clinton as the odds on favorite, netting the billionaires a staggering $57 billion in total wealth increase across world markets. However, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index, oligarchs lost a total of $41 billion during Wednesday‚Äôs epic slide ‚Äì with Slim being the biggest loser. ",1

One of the great myths being spun by the establishment media was that Donald Trump had no support from women, latinos and blacks in the US. As it turned out, this was a lie propagated in a failed attempt to margnalize Republican voters and give a false impression of a liberal Democratic mandate in America. In the end Trump gathered 29% of Latinos, 9% of African Americans and 49% of college educated white women. For months, mainstream media pundits and polls insisted that all of these demographics were exclusively for Hillary Clinton. How could they have got it so wrong? 
Psychologist and intenet radio personality Kiki Green explains how blacks were conned into voting for Hillary Clinton by the partnership between the Democratic Party, Hollywood and the Clinton campaign ‚Äì by cynically using celebrities like Beyonce, Jay Z and Katie Perry‚Ä¶

(VIDEO) Female College Students Protesting Because ‚ÄòTrump is a Rapist‚Äô,"
21st Century Wire says‚Ä¶ 
US college students continue to be emotionally traumatized and ‚Äòthreatened‚Äô by Donald Trump‚Äôs surprise presidential victory this week, sparking a wave of nationally coordinated street protests, organized in part through the George Soros funded Democratic Party ‚Äòcommunity organizing‚Äô web portal MoveOn.org . 
Various protests and riots have been organized around a number university campuses including Berkeley, Portland, New York City and Los Angleses. 
When asked why she scared by the election result, one female university student claimed that the President Elect is a ‚Äúrapist,‚Äù while another claim that, ‚ÄúHe [Trump] is about to have a court case about a 13 years old girl soon, and I‚Äôm not down for that.‚Äù 
The alleged court case the student is referring was actually dropped , and has since been exposed as a likely politically motivated hoax according to reports .

‚ÄòCOLOR REV‚Äô AGIT PROP: George Soros MoveOn Agitators March on America ‚Äì as Billionaire Instigator Sued,"November 11, 2016 By Shawn Helton Leave a Comment 
Shawn Helton 21st Century Wire 
Anti-Trump street protests linked to the Soros‚Äô funded organization MoveOn.org have cascaded across the nation for the third day following the 2016 presidential election result. 
Mainstream media outlets like CNN and MSNBC have given the protests around-the-clock media coverage, drowning out all other news stories, including a successful transition meeting between the President Elect and President Barack Obama. 
‚ÄòOUTSIDER VS. INSIDER‚Äô‚Äì Manufactured social unrest incited after announcement of Trump presidency. (Photo Illustration 21WIRE‚Äôs Shawn Helton) 
The Free Thought Project weighed in on the new developments concerning a series of centrally coordinated anti-Trump protests organized in part by by the George Soros NGO MoveOn: 
‚ÄúWashington, D.C. ‚Äì Billionaire globalist financier George Soros‚Äô MoveOn.org has been revealed to be a driving force behind the organizing of nationwide protests against the election of Donald Trump ‚Äî exposing the protests to largely be an organized, top-down operation ‚Äî and not an organic movement of concerned Americans taking to the streets as reported by the mainstream media. 
Wednesday saw protests in the streets of at least 10 major U.S. cities. Chicago, New York, Los Angeles, Philadelphia, Boston, Washington, D.C., Portland, Ore., St. Paul, Minn., Seattle , and several other cities saw protests, according to USA Today. 
In light of the protests and rioting that have transpired since the election of Trump, a closer analysis of the dynamic at play is warranted to gauge whether it‚Äôs an organic grassroots movement, or something much more organized, sophisticated and potentially dangerous.‚Äù 
Soros‚Äô affiliated organization MoveOn.org released the following press release yesterday afternoon: 
‚ÄúAmericans to Come Together in Hundreds Peaceful Gatherings of Solidarity, Resistance, and Resolve Following Election Results 
Hundreds of Americans, dozens of organizations to gather peacefully outside the White House and in cities and towns nationwide to take a continued stand against misogyny, racism, Islamophobia, and xenophobia. 
Tonight, thousands of Americans will come together at hundreds of peaceful gatherings in cities and towns across the nation, including outside the White House, following the results of Tuesday‚Äôs presidential election. 
The gatherings ‚Äì organized by MoveOn.org and allies ‚Äì will affirm a continued rejection of Donald Trump‚Äôs bigotry, xenophobia, Islamophobia, and misogyny and demonstrate our resolve to fight together for the America we still believe is possible. 
Within two hours of the call-to-action, MoveOn members had created more than 200 gatherings nationwide, with the number continuing to grow on Wednesday afternoon.‚Äù 
Soros Agit-Prop Empire 
Last year during the ongoing European migrant crisis, startling claims were levied by Hungarian PM Victor Orban (left photo), concerning the role played by Soros. 
PM Orban contended that the founder and chair of Open Society Foundations (Open Society Institute), was entrenched in a ‚Äú circle of activists,‚Äù that ‚Äúinadvertently become part of this international human-smuggling network.‚Äù 
The stunning declaration by Orban recalled the misguided machinations of ‚ÄòThe Occupy Movement‚Äô ( aka OWS) in 2011, as well as the Soros funded protests in Ferguson, Missouri in 2014, along with other Black Lives Matter protests this past year ‚Äì all of which were uniquely designed to push naive participants (along with paid provocateurs) into violent action and social unrest. 
Back in January, MoveOn publicly endorsed the Bernie Sanders campaign in what appeared to be a call to action for BLM associated groups seen backing Sanders. It‚Äôs worth mentioning, that MoveOn also supported the Obama campaign in 2008 and according to the website, Sanders was the only other candidate to reach the ‚Äúthreshold for an endorsement.‚Äù 
As we said back in March, professional political agitator flash mobs, had been mobilized at future Trump campaign events, making it very difficult to run a normal campaign ‚Äì as ‚Äòactivists‚Äô attempted to take away Trump‚Äôs ‚Äòstrength in numbers‚Äô at his rallies. This was confirmed at events in both Ohio, and at a Trump primary campaign event the University of Illinois Chicago earlier this year, where hundreds of BLM activists and Sanders supporters, triggered voilent clashes inside the venue and even stormed the stage , shortly after Trump started speaking, then again at Reno he was birddogged just prior to his election forcing secret service to escort Trump away. 
In a Politico article in early 2016 entitled ‚Äú Major donors consider funding Black Lives Matter ,‚Äù we gained deeper insight into the political funding for BLM and the Soros linked Democratic Alliance: 
‚ÄúMajor donors are usually not as radical or confrontational as activists most in touch with the pain of oppression,‚Äù said Steve Phillips, a Democracy Alliance member and significant contributor to Democratic candidates and causes. He donated to a St. Louis nonprofit group called the Organization for Black Struggle that helped organize 2014 Black Lives Matter-related protests in Ferguson, Missouri, over the police killing of a black teenager named Michael Brown. And Phillips and his wife, Democracy Alliance board member Susan Sandler, are in discussions about funding other groups involved in the movement.‚Äù 
It worth noting how Soros, a long time contributor to Hillary Clinton, donated $2 million in PAC money in 2015 and January of 2016, Soros reportedly gave $8 million to ‚Äúboost‚Äù Clinton‚Äôs campaign . Soros also recently funded $15 million to Latino groups looking to stop Trump‚Äôs rise towards a potential GOP nomination and beyond. 
Look for these political engineers to pit choreographed conservative and liberal groups against each other across the country ‚Äì as all of these hostile uprisings are designer engineered by party linked alliances. 
‚ÄòSOCIAL ENGINEERING‚Äô‚Äì Political memes and staged political flash mobs have been sparked by media, NGO‚Äôs and social media. (Image Source: abc news ) 
During the last month, it was revealed how investigative non-profit Project Veritas found evidence that the DNC paid participants to incite violence at Trump rallies during the course of the 2016 election. 
If those reports are accurate ‚Äì reports which have gone unchallenged so far ‚Äì this would be in violation of both election bylaws and also US criminal law.

USA Color Revolutions 
Both the purpose of these types of agitation activities seems to be to first cause a public disruption, and also to foment are a form of modern class warfare. These political protests are designed in such a way as to disguise its true intentions. Ultimately, a radical globalist and cultural marxist ‚Äúprogressive‚Äù agenda is at play ‚Äì eroding the legitimacy of a democratically elected government through a series of artificial ‚Äòcolor‚Äô upheavals, and where possible ‚Äì weakening a country‚Äôs national sovereignty through forced dependency on multilateral globalist institutions like the UN or IMF, while presenting shock and awe imagery in order to manipulate the public‚Äôs political perspective. 
This is how the US and its CIA conduct their destablization ‚Äòcolor revolution‚Äô campaigns overseas , and now astute observers will be able to see these exact same methods being deployed here inside the US. 
Overseas, Washington tends to use the same cast of NGO fronts to build-up pro-US political opposition groups, as well as plan and generate civil unrest. They include the Albert Einstein Institute (AEI), National Endowment for Democracy (NED), International Republican Institute (IRI), National Democratic Institute (NDI), Freedom House and later the International Center for Non-Violent Conflict (ICNC), and the US Agency for International Development (USAID), the financial and contractor arm of the Department of State. 
Inside the US, deep state actors in Washington generally work through Democratic Party affiliated organizations like MoveOn.org , as well as through labor union organizations like AFL-CIO , and UNITE HERE . These, along with many other similar organizations have been involved in organizing this week‚Äôs protests. 
It still remains to be seen if Trump‚Äôs stated dynamic political vision for America can unite an embattled nation by restoring international relations throughout the world, in addition to helping economic woes at home, or will it simply push the country further into authoritarianism. This remains to be seen. 
Certainly, judging by President Obama and Hillary Clinton‚Äôs total silence over their own party‚Äôs role in fomenting this week‚Äôs unrest ‚Äì one can only conclude that both party leaders approve of the protests and riots. The political motivation is undeniable ‚Äì to help delegitimize a new Trump presidency. 
But one thing is for sure ‚Äì there‚Äôs no doubt now that a systematic design is in place to unsettle the 45th president and the public should question why. 
Legal Action Against Soros Groups 
In a recent report featured at RT news we learn that George Soros and BLM activists will be sued for the deaths of slain police officers in Dallas and Baton Rouge: ‚ÄúThe father of the Dallas police officer who was killed by a lone gunman during a Black Lives Matter protest is suing the organization‚Äôs activists and George Soros for $550 million . In a separate suit a Baton Rouge police officer is suing for injuries sustained during a BLM protest. 
The father of Patrick Zamarripa filed a lawsuit against Black Lives Matter and other groups for allegedly ‚Äúinciting a war on police‚Äù that led to the death of his son. 
The lawsuit filed in US District Court in Dallas on Monday seeks $550 million in damages. 
‚ÄúWhile Defendant Black Lives Matter claims to combat anti-black racism,‚Äù the lawsuit said, according to the Fort Worth Star Telegram, ‚Äúthe movement has in fact incited and committed further violence, severe bodily injury and death against police officers of all races and ethnicities, Jews, and Caucasians. Defendant Black Lives Matter is in fact a violent and revolutionary criminal gang.‚Äù 
The misguided machinations behind the anti-Trump protests have dominated any peaceful transition into power for the president-elect. Will these protest groups be a reboot of the OWS movement, occupying the masses with their own hateful rhetoric as we move into 2017 and beyond?

George Soros begins his color revolution in America, as MoveOn ‚Äúactivists‚Äù march against Trump 
By Alex Christoforou The Duran 
Anti-Trump protesters march through the streets of New York shouting ‚ÄòNot my president‚Äô. 
MoveOn.org is a George Soros NGO‚Ä¶and George Soros NGOs have nothing to do with charity or justice, and everything to do with political leverage, and in extreme cases government insurrection. 
We have seen Soros begin destructive movements to remove those he deems unsuitable to govern in a variety of countries, most recently in Ukraine, with the Soros sponsored Maidan coup. 
Now it looks like Soros may be setting his sights on sabotaging the forthcoming Trump presidency. 
We do know, thanks to Wikileaks, that George Soros was a huge supporter of Hillary Clinton, as Hillary Clinton was always looking out of George Soros‚Äô best interests. 
We are certain Trump‚Äôs victory is a bitter pill for globalist Soros to swallow. Between Putin and Trump, Soros may finally be starting to feel his power on the world stage falter.

Henningsen: ‚ÄòUS Anti-Trump Protests Similar to Soros Color Revolutions Abroad‚Äô,"21st Century Wire says‚Ä¶ 
Organized efforts are underway by Democratic Party affiliated NGO‚Äôs to try and somehow delegitimize the results of this week‚Äôs US Presidential Election. 
On the eve of the US Election before voters went to the polls, 21WIRE political affairs analyst Patrick Henningsen accurately predicted this week‚Äôs unrest when he said : 
‚ÄúIf Trump wins, expect the likes of Soros and MoveOn.org to unleash wave after wave of flash mobs, who will protest, riot, smash and burn their way on to CNN‚Äôs 24 hour news rotation. Expect Occupy 2.0, and #BlackLivesMatter to rage.‚Äù 
On Friday, Henningsen talked to RT International about the post-elections protests that were coordinated in part by Democratic Party ‚Äòcommunity organizing‚Äô online platform MoveOn.org . Watch: 
. Not surprisingly, MoveOn.org have also launched a national ‚Äòactivist‚Äô campaign to ‚Äú Abolish the Electoral College ‚Äù after Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton came up short with 232 (including New Hampshire) to Donald Trump‚Äôs 306 (including Arizona and Michigan). Final totals are not yet in, but thus far 2016 would be the fifth time in U.S. history that a presidential candidate has won the White House while losing the total popular vote.

21WIRE Associate Editor Shawn Helton recently revealed more details about how the near exact same methods used in CIA and Soros-funded ‚Äòcolor revolutions‚Äô overseas ‚Äì are now being deployed on US domestic shores by similar NGO front organizations: has been the driving force behind nationwide protests against the election of Donald Trump. 
‚ÄúOverseas, Washington tends to use the same cast of NGO fronts to build-up pro-US political opposition groups, as well as plan and generate civil unrest.

Helton also raised the question as to why President Obama has stayed silent in the face of street protests, opting instead to ‚Äúlead from behind.‚Äù He explains: 
‚ÄúCertainly, judging by President Obama and Hillary Clinton‚Äôs total silence over their own party‚Äôs role in fomenting this week‚Äôs unrest ‚Äì one can only conclude that both party leaders approve of the protests and riots.

Other US campuses were organizing various theraputic activities like poetry readings, where ‚Äúhealthy snacks will be served.‚Äù 
The dogs were organized by NGOs the Human Animal Bond Research Initiative, Pet Partners, the Pet Leadership Council and the Pet Industry Joint Advisory Council.

"CBS 60 Minutes Withheld Trump‚Äôs Appeal to ‚ÄòStop Attacking Minorities,‚Äô and Ignored Reports of Attacks on Trump Supporters","November 15, 2016 By 21wire Leave a Comment 
J.R. Smith 21st Century Wire 
The election campaign might be over, but the mainstream media‚Äôs campaign against President Elect Donald Trump is in full swing. 
Between all of the fake polling, intentionally pro-Clinton partisan coverage, and mainstream media collusion with the Democratic National Party and the Clinton Campaign exposed through WikiLeaks‚Äô Podesta email dump ‚Äì nearly the entire US mainstream media is now in full damage-limitation mode desperately trying to preserve any crumb of credibility and perceived authority they might have left. 
It‚Äôs now become clear that the media is guilty on multiple fronts, as more proof has emerged of how they are helping to stoke violence, while promoting unfounded fears ‚Äì and all the while pushing fictional ‚Äòhate crime‚Äô hoaxes. 
CBS News flagship investigative program 60 Minutes conducted a recorded interview with Trump on Friday in which he made a direct plea on camera to any possible supporters to ‚ÄúStop it,‚Äù in reference to anyone that may have written racist slogans or abusive language in public, or at schools. In light of the numerous pockets of protests and outbreaks of partisan violence which have racked America since the election results were announced last week, it would have been in the public interest to release this powerful appeal by Trump, but instead mainstream CBS buried it for 3 days until 60 Minutes was scheduled to air later on Sunday evening nationwide. If CBS had any credibility remaining, this certainly will have finished it off. 
When told about alleged reports of a ‚ÄòTrump supporter‚Äô who were said to have been harassing Latinos and Muslims following his presidential win, Trump told interviewer Leslie Stahl , ‚ÄúI am so saddened to hear that.‚Äù He then added, ‚ÄúAnd I say, ‚ÄòStop it.‚Äô If it helps, I will say this ‚Äì and I will say right to the cameras: ‚ÄòStop it.'‚Äù 
One big thing in this incident that many mainstream media observers did not pick up is that at no time did Stahl give any specifics on these alleged ‚Äúabuses‚Äù by Trump supporters against Muslims and Latinos, and even though it‚Äôs obvious that Trump was not responsible for directing any alleged abuses ‚Äì Stahl still demanded an apology on their behalf ‚Äì without offering any evidence to support her claim. This was ‚Äòdrive-by‚Äô media at its worst. In fact, not one of these said accusations of abuse have been properly investigated by the media, and some may end up actually being media-generated rumors, or even hoaxes. 
Now, it‚Äôs perfectly understandable that Trump‚Äôs victory over the establishment‚Äôs heavily inflated candidate Hillary Clinton has left many Democrats, especially millennial college-aged students upset, angry and feeling more than a little delicate due to their bruised collective egos (they are not upset that Trump won, as much as they are upset that ‚Äòthey‚Äô lost). The real problem exists far beyond the learned immaturity of America‚Äôs politically correct-obsessed young adults. The real danger is that Democratic Party gutter operatives and their liberal media cohorts are actually staging, and fabricating ‚Äúhate crime‚Äù incidents in order to propagate the idea that the President Elect and his supporters are somehow ‚Äúcausing many minorities fearful about the future‚Äù. In reality, much of this hype is being generated through these same liberal media outlets. 
In fact, one Muslim female from Louisiana has since been forced to apologize for inventing her alleged ‚Äòhate crime‚Äô incident ‚Äì one designed to discredit Trump, and to help stoke more nationwide protests. 
Buzzfeed reported, via Religion of Peace : 
A woman who claimed she was attacked and robbed by two men near the University of Louisiana at Lafayette, including one wearing a Donald Trump hat, made up the story, police said in a statement. 
The woman had alleged the men yelled obscenities at her and took away her wallet and hijab, a scarf sometimes worn by Muslim women, The Advertiser reported. 
Lafayette Police officials said in a statement the incident is no longer under investigation, the paper reported. 
‚ÄúDuring the course of the investigation, the female complainant admitted that she fabricated the story about her physical attack as well as the removal of her hijab and wallet by two white males,‚Äù the statement reportedly read. 
NOTE: This story made national headlines and was not questioned or challenged by the hordes of self-described ‚Äújournalists‚Äù who populate the news and editorial newsrooms of America‚Äôs corrupt liberal mainstream media. 
That‚Äôs right ‚Äì this was just another hoax: 
Violent Democratic-Affiliated Street Gangs 
What Leslie Stahl and the rest of the gatekeepers at CBS and 60 Minutes have obscured is the fact since Tuesday‚Äôs election, nearly all of the so-called ‚Äòviolent hate crimes‚Äô have been carried out against Trump supporters ‚Äì by street gangs who are most clearly Democrat Party supporters. 
Here are just a few examples: @michellemalkin Even high school kids are not spared. Student Trump supporter attacked at Woodside High School https://t.co/e7tVvDJ6O8

Watch this clip taken from the radical leftist Portland protests this weekend, where Democratic Party supports attack a single woman in her car because they believed that she was a ‚ÄòTrump supporter.‚Äô These violent incidents reveal the flavor of anarchy which the Democratic Party and the sitting President of the United States, Barack Obama ‚Äì are condoning through their deaf silence over the multiple reports of street violence unleashed with the help of the Democratic Party‚Äôs online ‚Äòcommunity organizer‚Äô network MoveOn.org ‚Äì a digital platform partly funded by leading Clinton donor and billionaire George Soros . Watch this stunning clip: 
. Here is a video of clip of a white male in Chicago, 49 yr old David Wilcox, who was driving and scraped another vehicle. When the two parties stopped at the intersection to exchange insurance information, Wilcox was greeted by a gang of African-Americans, presumably Democratic Party supporters, who began pointing and shouting, ‚ÄúYou voted for Donald Trump!‚Äù before beating and robbing the man in the middle of the street. Wilcox was then dragged hundreds of yards as he tried to keep the gang from stealing his car in broad daylight. He was treated for multiple wounds at a local hospital. 
From reports we learned that at no time before the attack took place did Wilcox display any support for Donald Trump. It appears as if they attacked him because he was white. So could one call this a case of black on white racism? Regardless, it‚Äôs political intimidation done on the street ‚Äì which could also be defined as pure political fascism. In this instance, the violence was partisan, and carried out by what could be classed as unofficial Democrat foot soldiers ‚Äì enforcing a type of radical political regime on the streets of America. Watch this disturbing video: . Agitator and Chief: Where is Obama? 
These incidents have been mostly blacked out by a national US media who are obviously still working to discredit the Trump Presidency. 
Amidst all this violence, however, where is the current President Obama, or the Democratic Party‚Äôs losing candidate Hillary Clinton ‚Äì to help calm street thugs and violent ‚Äòprogressives‚Äô? It‚Äôs almost as if Obama and Clinton are enjoying the unrest. Most certainly though, Obama, Clinton and the Democratic Party are hoping to use this week‚Äôs media-generated liberal angst as future political leverage. 
What used to be regarded as a reputable investigative news program, 60 minutes, has gradually become a joke. It seems disinterested in covering anything of genuine interest, opting instead for running bland People Magazine and Time Magazine-style ‚Äòsafe‚Äô segments. Judging by its plummeting ratings, and its predictable cast of ‚Äòjob for life‚Äô government-approved media gatekeeper-cum-commentators like Anderson Cooper and Lesley Stahl, there is little hope for this institution. You might even say it‚Äôs irredeemable . 
One of the corporate mainstream‚Äôs worst offenders during the election was CNN host Brian Stelter (photo, left), whose own show is ironically titled ‚ÄúReliable Sources.‚Äù Stelter is meant to be CNN‚Äôs media watchdog person, laughably given the lofty title as ‚Äúsenior media analyst.‚Äù After leading CNN‚Äôs own exposed efforts to obscure and derail Trump‚Äôs Presidential run, while working to cover for a hugely unpopular (even among Democrats) Hillary Clinton candidacy, Stelter has now taken it upon himself to revamp his network‚Äôs horrible reputation as an establishment gatekeeper and manipulator of US elections. But it‚Äôs too late. The damage has already been done, and CNN will not regain the hanging facade of credibility it once struggled to retain. They are a dirty media outlet, and now everyone knows it. 
Now CBS News has been exposed in public view, but their crime is even worse than CNN‚Äôs which was just dirty politics in comparison. CBS News took it upon itself to compromise public safety, and put lives at risk ‚Äì all for its own selfish institutional political position. Twenty years ago, this might have been considered shameful, but in today‚Äôs toxic liberal media establishment ruled by an unhealthy feeling of superiority over the unwashed masses ‚Äì they are all way past shameless at this stage. 
None of them can be trusted anymore ‚Äì only tolerated, in the hope that they might actually report some useful news in the coming years.

FLASHBACK - Hillary Clinton‚Äôs ‚ÄòKKK‚Äô Smear Against Trump was Democrat Strategy,"November 21, 2016 By 21wire Leave a Comment 
William McGurn Wall Street Journal 
Let‚Äôs get this straight. Calling Hillary Clinton a ‚Äúbigot‚Äù has reporters asking every Republican in sight if Donald Trump has gone too far. But the Clinton campaign releases a video saying Mr. Trump is the candidate of the Ku Klux Klan, and it‚Äôs all okey-dokey? 
Then again, Mr. Trump has already been likened to Hitler, Mussolini and Stalin. Small wonder there‚Äôs a collective ho-hum when Democratic vice presidential nominee Tim Kaine says Mr. Trump is peddling ‚ÄúKKK values.‚Äù 
This is what Democrats do. It didn‚Äôt start with Mr. Trump, either. For years Democrats have portrayed the GOP as one giant hate group. 
Each presidential election, the drill goes like this: 
After Republicans nominate someone, he immediately finds himself having to prove he‚Äôs not a hater ‚Äì of African-Americans, of women, of gays, etc. 
This year Democrats added a twist. Mr. Trump, they claim, represents a break with all those decent and lovable Republicans such as Mitt Romney , John McCain and George W. Bush . Of course, this isn‚Äôt what they were saying back when these men were running for president. 
‚Ä¢ In 2000, for example, an NAACP ad recreated the gruesome murder of James Byrd to imply that then-Gov. Bush was sympathetic to lynching black men. Over footage of a chain being dragged by a pickup truck, Mr. Byrd‚Äôs daughter says, ‚ÄúSo when Gov. George W. Bush refused to support hate-crimes legislation, it was like my father was killed all over again.‚Äù 
‚Ä¢ When John McCain ran in 2008, Barack Obama warned that Republicans would scare people by saying, ‚ÄúYou know, he doesn‚Äôt look like all those other presidents on those dollar bills.‚Äù The McCain campaign fired back, accusing Mr. Obama of playing the race card from the ‚Äúbottom of the deck.‚Äù Funny thing: All those reporters always hearing ‚Äúdog whistles‚Äù from Republicans somehow didn‚Äôt hear this one. 
‚Ä¢ In 2012, when Mitt Romney went to the NAACP and told them face-to-face about his opposition to ObamaCare, the stories were all about how he was really just trolling for the racist vote. Vice President Joe Biden put it more explicitly, telling a largely African-American audience that if Mr. Romney were to win, he‚Äôd ‚Äúput ya‚Äôll back in chains.‚Äù 
The only difference today is that Republicans now have a nominee giving as good as he gets‚Ä¶",1
Hillary Clinton Supporters Now Calling for a Recount of Votes in Battleground States,"November 23, 2016 By 21wire Leave a Comment 
‚ÄúThe person who received the most votes free from interference or tampering needs to be in the White House. It may well be Donald J. Trump, but further due diligence is required to ensure that American democracy is not threatened.‚Äù 
21st Century Wire says‚Ä¶ 
Although the election was called on Nov 8th, the Democratic Party‚Äôs ongoing campaign to delegitimize the new incoming President is still ongoing. 
For those of us with long enough memories, the Democratic Party, their media operatives and the Clinton Campaign were claiming that Trump and the GOP would be engaged in this very same behavior after Hillary Clinton won the Presidency (as expected). 
Notice how the shoe is now on the other foot. 
It‚Äôs interesting reading past stories by ‚Äònews‚Äô sources linked to the Clinton Campaign and John Podesta as Politico has, who ran a feature on Aug 16th entitled, ‚ÄúWhy the GOP Will Never Accept President Hillary Clinton‚Äù which lays out the case of Hillary‚Äôs lock on the White House and how the evil Republicans will not accept her eventual election victory. 
‚ÄúWill Donald Trump respect the peaceful transition of power?‚Äù howled CNN‚Äôs Wolf Blitzer in the run-up to the election. The question now is: will the Democrats respect the result, and simply ‚ÄúMove On,‚Äù as they say? 
Of course, we now know that ‚Äòjournalists‚Äô like Wolf at CNN were getting their talking points directly the Clinton Campaign . 
As it turns out, the only thing illegitimate about the 2016 Election‚Ä¶ was the mainstream corporate media. 
More form the Guardian‚Ä¶ 
The Guardian 
A growing number of academics and activists are calling for US authorities to fully audit or recount the 2016 presidential election vote in key battleground states, in case the results could have been skewed by foreign hackers. 
The loose coalition, which is urging Hillary Clinton‚Äôs campaign to join its fight, is preparing to deliver a report detailing its concerns to congressional committee chairs and federal authorities early next week, according to two people involved. 
The document, which is currently 18 pages long, focuses on concerns about the results in the states of Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin. 
‚ÄúI‚Äôm interested in verifying the vote,‚Äù said Dr Barbara Simons, an adviser to the US election assistance commission and expert on electronic voting. ‚ÄúWe need to have post-election ballot audits.‚Äù Simons is understood to have contributed analysis to the effort but declined to characterise the precise nature of her involvement. 
A second group of analysts, led by the National Voting Rights Institute founder John Bonifaz and Professor Alex Halderman, the director of the University of Michigan‚Äôs center for computer security and society, is also taking part in the push for a review, and has been in contact with Simons. 
In a blogpost early on Wednesday, Halderman said paper ballots and voting equipment should be examined in Wisconsin, Michigan, and Pennsylvania, warning that deadlines were rapidly approaching. 
‚ÄúUnfortunately, nobody is ever going to examine that evidence unless candidates in those states act now, in the next several days, to petition for recounts,‚Äù he said. 
The developments follow Clinton‚Äôs surprise defeat to Donald Trump in the 8 November vote, and come after US intelligence authorities released public assessments that Russian hackers were behind intrusions into regional electoral computer systems and the theft of emails from Democratic officials before the election‚Ä¶

Hell Comes to Frogtown: Alt Right and Triumph of Transhumanism,"
While Richard Spencer‚Äôs half-joke of hailing Donald Trump with R oman salute rose a lot of dust, some remarks in his NPI speech point into rather sinister direction. A posthuman one. 
transcript with references and additional a/v material: 
Undoubtedly, there was a sigh of relief throughout the world when Hillary Clinton lost Presidential elections to Donald Trump. If for nothing else, then for the sake of quiet joy of watching adolescent commissars melt in tears ‚Äúbecause: racism, homophobia, xenophobia and whateverphobia‚Äù; it was a joy, and a relief, because it showed monolithic control system of moral nominalism , dubbed ‚Äúpolitical correctness‚Äù, to be a paper tiger. 
However, party is over and dialectics is back with the vengeance. As SJW s are, hopefully, moving out from the spotlight of post-historical stage, the new contender asserts his right to fashion the reality of our day and age into his own image. If we are to judge the day by the first gleam of dawn, this image will be just as ugly ‚Äì and just as unreal ‚Äì as hermaphrodite ideal of politically correct ‚Äú shitlib ‚Äù. 
In the words of more or less universally acclaimed leader of the ‚Äúalternative right‚Äù movement, Richard Spencer, in the future we are to deal with the leadership of ‚Äúchildren of the sun‚Äù. 
This is an interesting, and to my mind quite worrisome, statement of intent ‚Äì a manifestation of will, as Spencer would doubtless rectify me ‚Äì pointing out in many directions while seemingly focusing on the eternal ‚Äì and quite unidirectional ‚Äì circular movement of the pagan deity, revered by all self-respecting √ºbermenschen ‚Äì from Nietzsche to postmodern occultists. 
However, there‚Äôs a deeper astro-theological metaphor at work here. The ‚Äúpure eye that can gaze upon overabundance of joy without envy‚Äù (Nietzsche) in it‚Äôs virtual, postmodern, installment is not to be strictly represented by Swastika ‚Äì as Spencer apparently assumes, but by other, only seemingly ancient, symbol taken in fact from the world of tabletop and PC gaming and turned into ideological brand by Russian philosopher Alexander Dugin (or his minions): an individual widely promoted by core members of alt right movement. 
The symbol in question is an eight pointed star signifying the movement, not of sun, but of presumably primordial origin of everything: Chaos. 
In the lines to follow, we‚Äôll provide some preliminary analysis of the emerging situation: the channeling of chaos principle ‚Äì and adjacent chaos logic ‚Äì through loosely knit alt right movement, taking as a starting point some statements from Spencer‚Äôs speech held at NPI Conference in Washington D.C. on November 21 st . 

Triumph of the will or hipster Babylon working 

In introduction to his triumphal encomium to the ideological victory of alt right, embodied in the election of Donald Trump, Spencer makes one interesting remark: 
‚ÄúBut even though we always took Trump seriously, there was still a moment of unreality ‚Äì or perhaps too painfully intense reality ‚Äì when the state of Pennsylvania was called for Donald Trump, the moment when we knew Kek had smiled upon us, that meme magic was real. And though these terms are used half-jokingly, they represent something truly important‚Äìthe victory of will . We willed Donald Trump into office, made this dream into reality. ‚Äù 
It is all delivered in a manner of an in-joke, not to be taken too seriously. Moreover, to the uninitiated into mysteries of this Internet movement it is probably unclear who is ‚ÄúKek‚Äù and what exactly is ‚Äúmeme magic‚Äù. 
We‚Äôll start our explanation with lesser weirdness. 
‚ÄúMeme‚Äù is an expression denoting ‚Äúinexistent existent‚Äù, coined apparently by Richard Dawkins to explain how human thoughts fit in his evolutionary theology: memes are thoughts expressed in image and/or phrase which, by circulation in public, acquire the life and subsistence of their own and are able to ‚Äúinfect‚Äù the consciousness with their messages, like viruses. Meme is inexistent because there‚Äôs no such thing as thoughts having a biologically based self-subsistence and ability to procreate like viruses. Images and/or phrases are not living beings save by bad analogy that omits to tell us on what exactly it is based: what is that one principle making memes and viruses congenial. Yet they, quite paradoxically, exist because analogy apparently works . However no one seems to pose the question, why it works. 
Well, it works because it is magical. 

Chaos Magick 

Here we have an example of magical thinking in the postmodern ‚Äì in fact posthumanist ‚Äì vein, resting on assumption that what has not evolved in nature can ‚Äì and should ‚Äì be created in analogy to imagined process of evolution. If artificial construct is in line with ‚Äúprinciple of evolution‚Äù it is real or, to be more precise, it is in accordance with imaginary nature of this principle; it is imagined into existence . 
Therefore ‚Äúmeme magick‚Äù works only insofar it relies upon artificial, preferably technological medium for sustenance and on assumption that its recipients identify themselves with their artificial, preferably online identities that can indeed be imbibed with ‚Äúmemes‚Äù as they are in themselves artificial and arbitrary constructs. 
The goal of practitioner of such magic ‚Äì a far cry from what was traditionally considered to be magic ‚Äì is to change the world according to his will. This is, more or less, what is known from the Seventies of the last century as chaos magick , a postmodern imitation of ancient practice of acting in sub-human and sub-natural ‚Äúdomain‚Äù of the world, in the past mostly confined to people born with dubious talent to practice it. The peculiarity of chaos magick is, on the one hand, that it is entirely syncretic, i.e. that it uses everything that it‚Äôs practitioner can imbibe with intended, subjective, meaning, and that it relies on virtual, i.e. artificial world of mass culture, now embodied above all in Internet. 
The idea behind it all is that nothing is true and everything is possible . 
There are many interesting implications to this. 
The first is that everything is interrelated, i.e. that everything is connected with everything else. So any which way you take, you‚Äôll get where you want to get if you will it hard enough. The second is that there‚Äôs no hierarchy of higher and lower ‚Äì there‚Äôs only an infinite surface dissolving into ever more complex elements, dissolving in turn into nothingness, if concentrated upon. As there‚Äôs nothing higher, there‚Äôs nothing to be revered and everything can ‚Äì and indeed: should ‚Äì be an object of ironical laughter. And, most importantly, this is the world of dreams, ruled by what is usually called ‚Äúdream logic‚Äù but in actual fact: chaos logic or un-logic . 
In this sense, Richard Spencer quite accurately proclaimed Trump‚Äôs victory an accomplishment of meme- or chaos magick. 
Trump is willed into office by Internet memes binding the will of alt right adherents and turning their dream into reality ‚Äì virtual reality, one may add, yet reality nonetheless. The fact that Trump was elected for a plethora of motives ‚Äì from the appeal of his politics, to public takedown of Hillary Clinton by Wikileaks ‚Äì is immaterial, because in the world of chaos every subjective ‚Äúreality tunnel‚Äù, or interpretation of the world, is as real as any other. 
In this sense we can observe new ‚ÄúGod Emperor of USA‚Äù as a magical creation of Internet, by the Internet and for the Internet ‚Äì today still the Internet of interconnected computer nodes, but soon probably the Internet of things. If one is to push Spencer‚Äôs remark to it‚Äôs logical extreme, we can assert that illustrious Donald is the world‚Äôs first president of posthuman race; an embodiment of ultra progressive dream invoked to reality by professed ultra anti-progressive group. 
So that was lesser weirdness. Let us proceed now to high weirdness. 


We owe the reader an answer to a question: who the hell is Kek? 
Well, the reason why Spencer mentions him is again a magickal ‚Äúhalf-joke‚Äù: Kek is interpreted to be an ancient Egyptian deity by a number of Internet observers and identified with alt right memetic avatar ‚Äì Pepe the frog. While I habitually suspend judgment on all things Egyptian, because ancient Egyptian culture is a slippery ground even for experts, I consider this interpretation, upon closer inspection, to be quite valid in the virtual light of chaos logic. 
Namely, Pepe, the cartoon character, conceived in 2005. by cartoonist Matt Furie, emerged as a meme from the depths of Internet forums, more precisely: 4chan sub-forum /pol/, devoted to political discussions with no holds barred, which was, in view of some observers, a breeding ground for many alt right aficionados; a place of absolute freedom, therefore: absolute chaos. 
The expression ‚Äúkek‚Äù was also appropriated from the forums and stems from the in-joke among the players of World of Warcraft , replacing the standard Internet abbreviation ‚ÄúLOL‚Äù (‚Äúlaughing out loud‚Äù). Someone eventually noticed that Kek is in fact the name of frog-headed Egyptian deity, signifying Chaos and darkness, and Pepe was rebranded as Kek the deity ‚Äì ironic one, no doubt, half joking one, as surprisingly many alt righters like to put it, but deity nonetheless. 
It is important to point out that in view of the most ‚Äúesoteric Kekists‚Äù, that is: (half grinning) faithful of Kek/Pepe, the association was originally entirely haphazard and accidental, yet it developed into an ever growing system of synchronicities ‚Äì causally unrelated meaningful relations among events. So it came to pass that Kek sounds very similar to ‚Äòcuck‚Äô(originally: cuckservative), a term denoting old fashioned conservative who was still not ‚Äúred pilled‚Äù (another meme taken from pop culture, shared by both alt right and conspiracy theorists) by alt right or, should we assume: Kek himself; furthermore, Hillary Clinton addressed Pepe as nothing less than public enemy, identifying presumably the whole alt right movement with cartoon character. Then it happened that after this act Hillary fainted in front of the cameras, and that was immediately interpreted as an action of Kek. 
A good run-down of Kek/Pepe/Trump identification 
However, it all began with people noticing the numerical synchronicities in the random series of numbers in posts on /pol/ sub-forum: 
‚ÄûOne last thing you need to understand about imageboard culture: dubs. 
Every post on 4chan and similar venues comes with an 8-digit numerical stamp. This number represents that post‚Äôs entry position in the entire posting lineage of the imageboard. 
With the amount of traffic these sites get, the last couple digits of this number are essentially a random roll. When a poster gets repeated digits, its called ‚Äúdubs‚Äù, ‚Äútrips‚Äù, ‚Äúquads‚Äù, and so on. 
Since a poster can‚Äôt know their post number until after they‚Äôve submitted the post, its common for people to ‚Äúbet‚Äù the contents of their message on the occurrence of repeating digits (‚Ä¶) When that endeavor proves a successful, a ‚ÄúGET‚Äù has been made and the stroke of luck is celebrated. 
Out of this practice, a strange phenomenon began to take place on /pol/: discussion threads associated with Trump displayed noticeably frequent GETs. It wasn‚Äôt long before all of these seemingly random elements discussed so far became irreparably tied together within imageboard culture: Pepe the Frog (now /pol/‚Äôs unofficial mascot) Donald Trump (/pol/‚Äôs overwhelming candidate of choice) Repeating digit post numbers (‚ÄúGETS‚Äù) ‚ÄúKEK‚Äù (used as an expression of delight, particular in response to Trump‚Äôs ‚Äútrolling‚Äù of the establishment, as well as in reaction to unlikely GETs in general) 
‚Ä¶and a god was born.‚Äú ( source ) 

Synchronicities related to emergence of Kek the God and his merging with Trump in the bowels of Internet forums early on in the presidential campaign, are so numerous and, frankly, mind boggling that we cannot list them here, for the sake of brevity. For our purpose it is sufficient to point out that for many alt right aficionados, including core leadership, Kek is the God and Trump is his prophet, all declared with smug grin and ironical stance, yet with all the necessary power of conviction. 
Namely, chaos magick relies on laughter, or irreverence of its own principles because it is essentially un-principled. Fairly in accordance with its postmodern nature it seeks to deconstruct any kind of order to enable its ‚Äúpractitioner‚Äù to impose his own will and change the world ‚Äì as Spencer would put it: make his dreams a reality. 
I would go further and add: make all reality a dream ; because, chaos magick and alt right are nothing more but novel forms in the development of virtual, i.e. posthuman , world. The idea of adherence and reattachment to tradition that the alt right movement professes is nothing more but simulacrum appealing to people tired of liberal nihilism ‚Äì in its essence, however, it is a complete opposite: a disintegration of all substantial traditional principles ‚Äì above all an idea of preexistent hierarchy of Being ‚Äì into nothingness of primordial Chaos. 

Posthuman traditionalism 

I already developed this insight regarding the subversive work of Alexander Dugin, who is probably the most consequent subverter of Tradition with recognizable public persona acting in our age, but now we can see how his affiliates in USA and Europe are doing the same thing ‚Äì with less philosophical subtlety, but fueled by much greater raw power. Namely, alt right, if we are to judge by what it‚Äôs leadership advocates, is ideologically nothing more but project of building the simulated tradition ‚Äì something Richard Spencer likes to call ‚Äúpolitical theology‚Äù ‚Äì founded on New Age filtered Aryan myths , racial interpretation of Nietzsche and generally crossbred with ‚Äúdo your own thing‚Äù mentality, all done in the virtual ether of information technology. After all, if we are to agree with Spencer ‚Äì half jokingly of course ‚Äì that God Emperor was inaugurated by the act of Kek the God, then the victory of alt right ‚Äútraditionalists‚Äù is in fact the victory of technological magic; the act of pseudo magus waving the same wand Ray Kurzweill and his ilk offer to progressive lunatics . 
In the end, therefore, we are talking about another victory of posthumanism, branded, spontaneously or otherwise, as traditionalism. The obsession of alt right adherents with ‚Äúidentity‚Äù in general and ‚Äúwhite identity‚Äù in particular points to a fact that they are unable to realize the simple truth of Tradition they supposedly defend: they understand identity as something that can be created and not something that must be accepted . Observing the plethora of various, rather eccentric individuals in it‚Äôs vanguard, from macho gay postmodern Spartans to adherents to all kinds of exotic ‚Äì and to a large extent made up ‚Äì pagan religions one is at the lack to find a common denominator, save maybe for quite unchallenged neo-darwinist stance, especially to be found among ‚Äúgame‚Äù bloggers as Chateau Heartiste . If someone thinks that he can reattach himself to pre-modern spiritual history of humankind ‚Äì actually the only one there is ‚Äì while at the same time musing about ‚Äúalpha and beta males‚Äù, ‚Äúsexual market‚Äù, ‚Äúsignaling and counter-signaling‚Äù, professing therefore his proud monkey ancestry and reducing human relations to mental GMO of memes, genes and biological analogies, he is doing nothing else than unconsciously subverting the very thing he seemingly defends. 
The allure of alt right lies in it‚Äôs dialectical opposition to political correctness and rampart destruction of moral substance of the West, induced by process of globalization. Yet this is an eristic or, to use an excellent neologism invented by one correspondent of mine: discordian dialectic; the process of infinite division into ever multiplying opposites founded on the principle of Chaos. It is all done with the crooked half grin, a pinch of salt to every smug remark ‚Äì with irony of the man who knows he‚Äôs a liar and a cheat. But smug humor goes just a short way. In the end it morphs into sarcasm and irreverence of what should in fact be revered and subverts the very principles it professes to defend, far more effectively than dead serious PC brigade or techno loonies of posthumanist movement could ever hope for. 
We‚Äôll end with the word of warning to Christian adherents of alt right. The words have a definite meanings and power. There‚Äôs only one Chaos and there‚Äôs only one bringer of light from Chaos ‚Äì as some Kek worshipers already defined the poor Frog‚Äôs main job . And it‚Äôs not the One to be defined as ‚ÄúGod from God, Light from Light‚Äù, but ‚ÄúGod from Gutter, Light from Darkness‚Äù. A real Darkness shining in virtual brightness. Hope you guess His name. 
So, without a pinch of irony, I declare: be careful who your ‚Äúhail‚Äù.

EU Red Scare: Brussels Passes New Resolution to ‚ÄòCounter Russian Media Propaganda‚Äô,"
21st Century Wire says‚Ä¶ 
If there was any doubt as to the intellectual bankruptcy and democratic decline of the EU‚Äôs super bureaucratic class, those doubts can finally be put to rest this week. It seems that Europe‚Äôs technocrats have truly surrendered to their own program of ‚ÄòEuro Red Scare‚Äô brainwashing. 
The new EU Resolution compares Russian media organizations to terrorist groups like ISIS (see full report below). The report also claims that Russian ‚Äú social media and internet trolls ‚Äù are somehow ‚Äú challenging democratic values .‚Äù The new anti-Russia legislation will now require many millions in funding to implement all of the ‚Äòanti-Russia‚Äô programs that bureaucrats believe are needed to counter this ‚Äògrave threat to democracy.‚Äô A touch oxymoronic, isn‚Äôt it? 
EU Parliamentarians appear to have lost the plot. Claiming that Europe is currently ‚Äòat war with Russia‚Äô is one thing, but the hysterical notion that ‚ÄúRussian propaganda‚Äù is somehow damaging the minds of Europeans is a whole new level of crazy. 
No wonder millions of Britons voted to leave the EU this past summer. 
The cold reality is that most of the ‚Äòdangerous views and information‚Äô aired on RT are by presenters, contributors and pundits ‚Äî westerners , not Russians. The reason RT‚Äôs audience ratings are growing is because the version of news and analysis being presented is resonating with international audiences who see RT‚Äôs reports as more accurate, and truthful than media monoliths like the BBC, CNN and other establishment outlets. By spending most of their time, effort and budgets crafting propaganda pieces to cover for the plethora of lies and clandestine operations globally, the western media are killing off their own relationship with domestic audiences. The age of talking down to the public and assuming them as fools is over. RT understood this in 2005 when their news network took shape. 11 years later, western media moguls are playing catch-up, albeit in vain.Sunset for Goebbels. Hamstrung with layers of management and editorial committees infested with intelligence agency operatives and journalists on the payroll of a Deep State star chamber that is so tangled in its own web of subterfuge ‚Äì obsessed with controlling real information, rather than disseminating it ‚Äì that their media environment has become too dysfunctional for its own good. They are simply unable to do authentic journalism, or speak truth to power . Incredibly, instead of working to help western media to phase out its own propaganda regime, ideologues in Brussels want to attack RT. 
The faceless force behind this latest xenophobic EU resolution are those in Washington, Paris and London who are still hell-bent on keeping anti-Russian economic sanctions in place ‚Äì much to the disservice of many European businesses and their workers who are losing out on trade with Russia. When Donald Trump is sworn in this January, the US-UK-EU anti-Russian axis could disintegrate within a year ‚Äì so this latest move by Brussels could be a last-ditch effort to do some damage as Europe‚Äôs NeoMcCarthyites plot their escape out the back door. From their disastrous coup d‚Äôetat in the Ukraine , to NATO‚Äôs hubris in the Baltic and beyond, and the EU‚Äôs ‚Äòmigrant crisis‚Äô debacle, and the tens of millions of Euros being laundered by EU member states through a pseudo NGO called the ‚Äò White Helmets‚Äô in Syria ‚Äì these last 3 years will certainly go down as one of the worst chapters in modern diplomatic history ‚Äì an abject failure of incompetent foreign policy, underpinned by a backward and confused ideology. 
We tried to find a coherent western reporting on this subject, but it seems even the western mainstream are too embarrassed to cover this bizarre Brussels adventure. See the following video and written report by RT International‚Ä¶ 
. RT MEPs in Strasbourg have voted on a non-legislative resolution which calls for the EU to ‚Äúrespond to information warfare by Russia.‚Äù RT and Sputnik news agency are alleged to be among the most dangerous ‚Äútools‚Äù of ‚Äúhostile propaganda.‚Äù 
The EU Parliament‚Äôs resolution demonstrates ‚Äú political degradation ‚Äù in regard to the ‚Äú idea of democracy ‚Äù in the West, Russian President Vladimir Putin said on Wednesday, commenting on the vote. 
Putin pointed out that while ‚Äú everyone tries to lecture ‚Äù Russia on democracy, European lawmakers themselves resort to a policy of restrictions, ‚Äú which is not the best way ‚Äù to deal with any issues. 
‚Äú The best approach is an open discussion, in which bright and solid arguments to support one‚Äôs point of view should be presented ,‚Äù Putin said. 
Adding that he hopes the Western move to ‚Äú counter Russian propaganda ‚Äù won‚Äôt lead to serious restrictions, the president congratulated RT and Sputnik journalists on their work. 
In the Wednesday vote, 304 MEPs supported the resolution based on the report ‚Äò EU strategic communication to counteract propaganda against it by third parties ‚Äô, with 179 voting against it and 208 abstaining. 
Written by a Polish member of the European Conservatives and Reformists (ECR) group, Anna Fotyga, the report alleged that Moscow aims to ‚Äú distort the truth, provoke doubt, divide the EU and its North American partners, paralyze the decision-making process, discredit the EU institutions and incite fear and uncertainty among EU citizens .‚Äù 
The report suggests that Moscow provides financial support to opposition parties and organizations in EU member states, causing disintegration within the bloc. 
At the same time, Russia is accused of ‚Äú information warfare ,‚Äù with such entities as RT TV channel, Sputnik news agency, Rossotrudnichestvo federal agency and the Russkiy Mir (Russian World) fund alleged to be among its most threatening propaganda ‚Äútools. ‚Äù 
The document places Russian media organizations alongside terrorist groups such as Islamic State (IS, formerly ISIS/ISIL). 
The report also mentions some ‚Äú social media and internet trolls ‚Äù from Russia who are thought to ‚Äú challenge democratic values .‚Äù 
It called for the establishment of measures to tackle the perceived Russian propaganda threat, by means of ‚Äú investing in awareness raising, education, online and local media .‚Äù It also suggests stronger cooperation between the EU and NATO ‚Äú on strategic communication .‚Äù 
Sputnik has already appealed to the UN, the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE) and a number of international journalists‚Äô organizations and NGOs, including Reporters Without Borders, to take measures to stop what it considers to be interference into freedom of speech in the EU. 
‚Äú The resolution hits straight at a number of respected media, including Sputnik agency, and has an aim to stop their activity in the EU. Moreover, the resolution bluntly contradicts the EU‚Äôs own human rights and freedom of press norms,‚Äù reads the letter signed by Sputnik Editor-in-Chief Margarita Simonyan. 
During the parliamentary debate that preceded the vote, MEPs campaigning for the resolution said the EU was ‚Äú at war with Russia, on a collision course with each other traveling faster than a jet fighter ,‚Äù and that with an alleged ‚Äú aim to split Europe, the Kremlin forces its information into our countries .‚Äù ",1
The Amish In America Commit Their Vote To Donald Trump; Mathematically Guaranteeing Him A Presidential Victory - ABC News,"18 SHARE The Amish in America have committed their vote to Donald Trump guaranteeing him the Presidency. (AP Photo / Dennis System) 
COLUMBUS, OH (AP) ‚Äî History was made today in Columbus, Ohio when more than 3 million Amish poured into the city to see the American Amish Brotherhood (AAB), an organization which acts as an informal governing body for the Amish community, endorse Donald Trump for president. That number represents a significant portion of the total Amish population, which the United States Census Bureau says numbers more than 20 million men and women nationwide all pledging their vote to Trump for President. With the full force of the Amish community behind him, Donald Trump is now mathematically guaranteed to win the presidency in November. 
The organization typically meets once a year and the meetings usually consist of about 300 Amish leaders who meet to discuss the challenges, such as urban sprawl, that face the community. This year, however, the organization wanted as many people in attendance as possible so they can effectively instruct all Amish men and women of legal voting age to cast their vote for the flamboyant Republican nominee. 
The Amish, who are direct descendants of the protestant reformation sect known as the Anabaptists, have typically stayed out of politics in the past. As a general rule, they don‚Äôt vote, serve in the military, or engage in any other displays of patriotism. This year, however, the AAB has said that it is imperative that they get involved in the democratic process. 
‚ÄúOver the past eight years, the Democratic Party has launched a systematic assault on biblical virtues,‚Äù said AAB chairman Menno Simons. ‚ÄúWe have seen more and more Christians being persecuted for their faith; we have seen the state defile the institution of marriage. Now, they want to put a woman in the nation‚Äôs highest leadership role in direct violation of 1 Timothy 2:12. We need to stop this assault and take a stand for biblical principles. Donald Trump has shown in both action and deed that he is committed to restoring this country to the Lord‚Äôs way.‚Äù 
According to statistician Nate Silver of the website fivethirtyeight.com, there are no possible scenarios in which Hillary Clinton can win with Donald Trump carrying the Amish vote. 
‚ÄúThe Amish have their highest numbers in perennial swing states like Pennsylvania, Virginia, Ohio, Indiana, and Iowa,‚Äù Silver noted. ‚ÄúThey also have strong numbers in reliably Democratic states like Michigan, Illinois, and New York, meaning that Hillary will lose those states as well. There is also a sizeable community in Florida which, while not as large as it is in the Midwest, is still large enough to turn Florida for Trump. Over the next two weeks, you can expect Hillary to enter into a state of freefall in all of my predictive models.‚Äù 
The Clinton campaign issued a written statement to the AAB asking them to reconsider their decision. 
‚ÄúI don‚Äôt believe that Donald Trump is the person who best represents your interests,‚Äù Clinton wrote to the AAB. ‚ÄúAs a career real estate developer, he represents a clear threat to your simple way of life. As former first lady of Arkansas, I understand the concerns of rural Americans more than any candidate in this election. I implore you to consider all of the facts before voting for my opponent.‚Äù 
Most pundits believe that Mrs. Clinton‚Äôs plea is too little too late. 
During a press conference in Manhattan, Trump thanked the AAB for their support and promised to put the Amish to work maintaining government buildings, which he said would save taxpayers millions because ‚Äúthe Amish do great work for a very low price.‚Äù 
Though Clinton has pledged to stay in the race until the very end, many of her campaign workers have already resigned. According to the Associated Press, it is expected that the Clinton campaign will lose 50% of its staff over the next two weeks. There is a general mood of hopelessness and despair in the Clinton camp, and many simply want to cut their losses. 
‚ÄúIt looked like she was going to win this election easily,‚Äù said Paul Horner, a campaign worker in Ohio, ‚ÄúBut this is what happens when you wake a sleeping giant. Cleary, Mrs. Clinton took far too much for granted in this race, and we are all now paying the price. It‚Äôs really sad to see the campaign end this way.‚Äù

Obama Signs Executive Order Declaring Investigation Into Election Results; Revote Planned For Dec. 19th - ABC News,"64 SHARE President Obama has signed an Executive Order declaring an investigation into the election results and plans for a revote on December 19th. (AP Photo / Dennis System) 
WASHINGTON, D.C. (AP) ‚Äî Following the results of Tuesday night‚Äôs election, President Obama has signed Executive Order 13805 , which orders a full recount of all votes cast in the election and calls for a special election to be held on December 19 th . Obama signed the order in response to the concerns of thousands of voters across the country who said that they were prevented from casting a ballot on election day , too many absentee ballots have not been found or counted , equipment failures, as well as concerns that some members of the electoral college may have acted unethically. 
‚ÄúPeople all over the country have been flooding my office with calls, telling my staff of horror stories about being harassed and intimidated by poll workers,‚Äù Obama told reporters. ‚ÄúMany have even said that they were flat out denied entry into the voting booths to cast their ballots if they were wearing a Hillary Clinton shirt or other signs showing support for her as President. This was especially bad in areas of Florida and North Carolina where there are high numbers of Latino and African American voters. We must investigate these claims. The margin of victory is too close to call, and the outcome of this election is too important. There is just too many legal challenges in too many states to just call this a victory for Trump.‚Äù 
Under the President‚Äôs order, the votes cast in all precincts nationwide will be recounted, and all poll workers who took part in Tuesday‚Äôs election will be subjected to strict background checks. This process is expected to take 30 days. In precincts where the Department of Justice has cause to believe that voter suppression has occurred, new elections will be held on Dec. 19 th, with those results being used to help determine who will represent the individual states in the electoral college. 
Not surprisingly, Donald Trump is not happy with the president‚Äôs decision. 
‚ÄúCrooked Hillary lost this election fair and square. They tried to rig this election against me, but the American people didn‚Äôt allow that to happen. President Obama doesn‚Äôt care about what the American people want. I said the system was rigged all along, and this proves I was right.‚Äù 
The president also said that the DOJ will be taking a close look at the members of the electoral college. 
‚ÄúWe have received information from a very reliable source that suggests there may have been some collusion between the members of the electoral college and poll workers in certain swing states. We still need to investigate these claims, but if they are true, we will take all the appropriate actions necessary.‚Äù 
Paul Horner, a professor of political science at UCLA, believes that the issues with the electoral college run much deeper that this election. 
‚ÄúMost people feel that it is their right as citizens to pick the president of the United States, but there is nothing in the constitution that says that. Hillary Clinton won the popular vote by more than 200,000 votes , but because of the electoral college, she still lost. That decision is reserved solely for the 538 electors who meet in their respective states on December 19 th . What the people are actually voting for are their states‚Äô electors, not for the President. Though the system is odd and unfair, it has persisted because many insist that it works just fine as it is, with the winner of the popular and electoral vote usually matching. That does not mean, however, that it will continue to work just fine in the future. The way the system is set up could cause it to malfunction in some potentially terrifying ways, this recent election being one of them.‚Äù 
Political Analyst Matt Daemon told ABC News that he agrees with the President‚Äôs Executive Order and said that he would like to see the electoral college done away with altogether. 
‚Äú[The electoral college] is a f‚Äîking joke; we should be using the popular vote instead. It may have made sense in 1788, but so did the three fifths compromise . Everyone should have an equal vote, and that‚Äôs just not the case with the electoral college. You know what the electoral college gave us? It gave us George W. Bush. It gave us a war in Iraq, and the worst recession since the great depression. It‚Äôs time to bring our system into the 21 st century. I hope Obama fixes this, because president Trump is going to be a nightmare.‚Äù 
Obama finished up the press conference explaining his plans for moving forward. 
‚ÄúWe‚Äôre going to investigate the FBI into their role in all of this,‚Äù Obama said. ‚ÄúWhy did FBI director James Comey on Sunday say that the agency is not recommending charges against Clinton after reviewing all of her emails; declaring Hillary Clinton a free women conveniently just one day before the election? Why wasn‚Äôt this news released earlier? How many votes were lost because of this?‚Äù Obama said. ‚ÄúIf all of these questions cannot be answered by our deadline set in December, a recount will be ordered.‚Äù

""Concern Grows Over Soros-Linked Voting Machines   
Sixteen states may be using balloting equipment from a company tied to the leftist billionaire  
by Edmund Kozak | Updated 24 Oct 2016 at 5:21 PM  
Concern is growing over revelations that voting machines in a significant number of states could be linked to a company tied directly to billionaire leftist George Soros and his personal quest to create a nationless, borderless global state. 

The U.K.-based Smartmatic company posted a flow-chart on its website that it had provided voting machines for 16 states, including important battleground states like Florida and Arizona. Smartmatic Chairman Mark Malloch-Brown is a former U.N. official and sits on the board of Soros‚Äô Open Society Foundations. Since the story first broke, the flow-chart has disappeared from Smartmatic‚Äôs website, raising further questions about the real status of the Soros-tied voting equipment and whether it is truly being deployed in U.S. elections. 

If Malloch-Brown's Soros ties weren't troubling enough, he also has ties to the Clintons through his work at two consulting firms. 

According to a spokesperson for the National Association of Secretaries of State, Smartmatic is not on a list of federally certified providers for election systems and officials in several states‚Äô have contested that their equipment came from Smartmatic. Why, then, had Smartmatic bragged about providing over 50,000 voting machines for U.S. elections?""

Hillary Clinton's e-mail server company got almost $1 million in government loans starting immediately after they were secretly asked to wipe Hillary Clinton's name from her e-mails. 

Platte River Networks (PRN) got a $493,000 loan from the Small Business Administration in August 2014 and another $350,000 loan in September 2015: 

Public government data available as USAspending.gov 

The first half-million dollar loan arrived not one month after PRN employee Paul Combetta was caught accidentally revealing his company was deleting evidence at Hillary's request in July 2014 . 

The second $350,000 loan came about one year later.

After getting the first loan, PRN moved to a large office space after previously working out of the owner‚Äôs condo. The head of the Small Business Administration is Maria Contreras-Sweet , a Mexican immigrant who was appointed to the office by Barack Obama two months before Hillary's PRN got the first loan. 

WikiLeaks leaks have proven Hillary's corrupt pay-to-play scheme. GotNews has shined a light on how Hillary gets favors from Hispanic and Democratic government bureaucrats before . 

Did Hillary Clinton pay her e-mail server company Platte River Networks (PRN) with almost $1 million in favorable government loans ‚Äî given out by a political friendly ‚Äî in order to alter her illegal e-mails and get her name off them?

""WHY BILL CLINTON'S 26 TRIPS ON THE LOLITA EXPRESS CHILD RAPE JET MATTER May 15, 2016  
Daniel Greenfield   
We don't know what Bill Clinton did or didn't do in company with Jeffrey Epstein. But we certainly know what Epstein did and, almost as outrageously, what he got away with doing . 

Some of the most shocking allegations against Epstein surfaced only after the conclusion of an FBI probe, in civil suits brought by his victims: for example, the claim that three 12-year-old French girls were delivered to him as a birthday present. But the feds did identify roughly 40 young women, most of them underage at the time, who described being lured to Epstein's Palm Beach home on the pretense of giving a ""massage"" for money, then pressured into various sex acts, as well as the ""Balkan sex slave"" Epstein allegedly boasted of purchasing from her family when she was just 14. More recently, a big cash payment from Mail on Sunday coaxed one of Epstein's main accusers out of anonymity to describe what she claims were her years as a teenage sex toy. This victim, Virginia Roberts, produced a photo of herself with Prince Andrew in 2001 and reported that Epstein paid her $15,000 to meet the prince. Then 17 years old, she claims that she was abused by Epstein and ""loaned"" to his friends from the age of 15. 

Sex crimes of the kind Roberts alleges took place typically carry a term of 10 to 20 years in federal prison. Yet when all was said and done, Epstein served his scant year-plus-one-month in a private wing of the Palm Beach jail and was granted a 16-hour-per-day free pass to leave the premises for work. 

In short, Epstein was never actually in jail. During his ""house arrest,"" he flew around the country on his jets from his New York City place to his private island. At least one of Epstein's victims claimed to have met Bill Clinton. And it turns out that Bill Clinton was a much more regular passenger on the Lolita Express. 

Former President Bill Clinton was a much more frequent flyer on a registered sex offender's infamous jet than previously reported, with flight logs showing the former president taking at least 26 trips aboard the ""Lolita Express"" -- even apparently ditching his Secret Service detail for at least five of the flights, according to records obtained by FoxNews.com. 

Clinton's presence aboard Jeffrey Epstein's Boeing 727 on 11 occasions has been reported, but flight logs show the number is more than double that, and trips between 2001 and 2003 included extended junkets around the world with Epstein and fellow passengers identified on manifests by their initials or first names, including ""Tatiana."" The tricked-out jet earned its Nabakov-inspired nickname because it was reportedly outfitted with a bed where passengers had group sex with young girls. 

It doesn't help that the Democratic establishment seems to have played a role in getting Epstein a pass on child rape, that Bill Clinton already had rape accusations in his past or that the Clintons had become notorious for their willingness to do favors for criminals in exchange for money. 

Either way we've come a long way from Gary Hart being bounced for ""Monkey Business"" to Bill Clinton flying around on a child rapist's plane without anyone in the media seeming to care much about it. 

Social conservatives often get a bad rap. But there really is no limit to how low standards can fall when any trace of a moral code vanishes out the window. What did Bill Clinton actually do? Who knows. More importantly these days, who cares

""She's pure evil,'' says one outreach worker, who asked that her name not be used in any story about Taylor. 

... 

Court has heard that Taylor's DNA was found on 113 items retrieved from the Pickton property ? including handcuffs, condoms, clothing, syringes ? and also on items that belonged to some victims ? Brenda Wolfe's lipstick, Mona Wilson's rosary. 

One witness, Pickton pal Pat Casanova, told the court he once received fellatio from a woman he knew as ""Angel,"" who'd been brought to the farm by Taylor. He said he gave the money to Taylor, who shared some of it with ""Angel."" 

Another witness, Gina Houston, put Taylor on the same bed with victim Sereena Abotsway, in Pickton's trailer. 

In his lengthy police interview, Pickton repeatedly tells police he wants to speak with Taylor. 

On the stand, Houston recounted a conversation she'd had with Pickton about Taylor, shortly before his arrest. 

""Willie told me that he believed she (Taylor) would do the right thing when she came back. That she would take responsibility for what she said she would take responsibility for.""

Jeff Wells points to other odd things. 

A week or so ago a man called Steve Remian committed suicide-by-cop but: The name ""Steve Remian"" surfaced at the Robert ""Willie"" Pickton murder trial in New Westminster, B.C., last March, when jurors were told that Remian's name ? with a Burnaby, B.C., address ? was on the label of a suitcase packed into a box found in Pickton's workshop. 

In April, jurors heard further evidence that DNA testing on two hairs found on a Hudson's Bay blanket removed from Pickton's motorhome linked one to Pickton, and the other to a ""Steve Remian."" 

A source involved in the Oakville shooting investigation told the Star that the man shot by police had been charged with sexual assault earlier in life while living in Oakville, but had been acquitted, although a co-accused was convicted.

It does seem like a regular hive of activity: Robert Pickton's pig farm was a constant buzz of activity, with people and vehicles coming and going all the time, a woman who lived in Pickton's trailer for a time testified on Wednesday. 

Tanya Carr, 35, told the jury in Pickton's murder trial that people were coming and going all day long at the Port Coquitlam, B.C., farm and it wasn't unusual for people to show up late at night looking for Pickton or his brother Dave.

Also there are those Hells Angels and the ""Piggy Palace"": 

""It was a rough crowd"" at Piggy's Palace, said Brian, a musician who played there a few years ago with the hard-rock band South City Slam. 

The nightclub, he said, was inside an old building on a property Dave Pickton and his brother Robert own at 2552 Burns Rd., near their pig farm on Dominion Road in Port Coquitlam.... 

""Even the women were tough- looking -- a lot of leather and denim. It wasn't a cocktail-gown kind of place ,"" he recalled. 

Brian, who didn't want his last name used, recalled that there was a coat-check girl and a sign saying, ""Check your knives and other weapons at the door."" ... 

The crowd at Piggy's Palace often included men wearing Hells Angels biker club colours. 

""They were there a lot,"" said Brian. ""The people who came all seemed to know one another.""

""July 7, 2016 Developments in PKI occurred in the early 1970s at the British intelligence agency GCHQ , where James Ellis , Clifford Cocks and others made important discoveries related to encryption algorithms and key distribution.[ 19 ] However, as developments at GCHQ are highly classified, the results of this work were kept secret and not publicly acknowledged until the mid-1990s. 

The public disclosure of both secure key exchange and asymmetric key algorithms in 1976 by Diffie, Hellman , Rivest, Shamir , and Adleman changed secure communications entirely.

Consumer groups raised questions about privacy, access, and liability considerations, which were more taken into consideration in some jurisdictions than in others.

1. Abel Danger ( AD ) claims that Serco began providing Zulu-timing signals through servers in the Vancouver B.C. offices of Starnet Communications in 1996 to record bets by prospective blackmail victims on the time of death of adults and children in live-broadcast snuff films. 

2. AD claims that Hillary Clinton deployed Serco 8(a) companies to Vancouver in August 1999 to confiscate the Starnet servers ‚Äì together with all the betting records of snuff films produced at the Pickton pig farm ‚Äì and transfer them to blackmailers embedded in the Federal Bridge Certification Authority. 

3. AD claims that Serco 's blackmailers on the federal bridge have forced the US Patent and Trademark Office to issue Zulu time lapse keys to a voting pad input device (US 7537159 B2) with which the George Soros-tied company Smartmatic can allegedly switch votes from Donald Trump to Hillary Clinton. 

4. United States Marine Field McConnell ‚Äì Global Operations Director of Abel Danger ‚Äì has offered to serve as a five-star general in a future Trump administration so he can first recognize and then destroy Clinton's pig-farm bridge to Serco 's 8(a) blackmailers in the patent office.

""Concern Grows Over Soros-Linked Voting Machines   
Sixteen states may be using balloting equipment from a company tied to the leftist billionaire  
by Edmund Kozak | Updated 24 Oct 2016 at 5:21 PM  
Concern is growing over revelations that voting machines in a significant number of states could be linked to a company tied directly to billionaire leftist George Soros and his personal quest to create a nationless, borderless global state. 

The U.K.-based Smartmatic company posted a flow-chart on its website that it had provided voting machines for 16 states, including important battleground states like Florida and Arizona. Smartmatic Chairman Mark Malloch-Brown is a former U.N. official and sits on the board of Soros‚Äô Open Society Foundations. Since the story first broke, the flow-chart has disappeared from Smartmatic‚Äôs website, raising further questions about the real status of the Soros-tied voting equipment and whether it is truly being deployed in U.S. elections. 

If Malloch-Brown's Soros ties weren't troubling enough, he also has ties to the Clintons through his work at two consulting firms. 

According to a spokesperson for the National Association of Secretaries of State, Smartmatic is not on a list of federally certified providers for election systems and officials in several states‚Äô have contested that their equipment came from Smartmatic. Why, then, had Smartmatic bragged about providing over 50,000 voting machines for U.S. elections?""

Starnet CEO heads to court; hiring continues; sweet deals in Antigua   
Friday Aug 27 1999  
by Brent Mudry  
CEO SEEKS TO BLOCK ACCESS TO SENSITIVE RECORDS 

In the first legal challenge to the Starnet Communications International police raid, Starnet chief executive Mark Dohlen has launched a court action seeking to assert solicitor-client privilege over certain documents and records seized during searches of Starnet's corporate headquarters and his personal residence a week ago. In a motion filed Thursday in the Supreme Court of British Columbia, prominent Vancouver criminal defence lawyer Ian Donaldson seeks to block police access to sensitive records seized by members of the RCMP and the Co-ordinated Law Enforcement Unit on Aug. 20. 

Certain disputed files have been sealed in court pending resolution of the privilege claim. An initial court hearing has been scheduled for Tuesday morning on the search warrant challenge. 

HIRING SPREE SEEKS PORN-PEDDLER, OTHERS 

In an unrelated Starnet matter, the Vancouver-based Internet gambling and pornography company appears eager to mount a new hiring spree, recruiting staff in numerous positions, including its porn division, which it hopes to quickly sell off. 

In a large ad on Thursday in The Georgia Straight, a Vancouver weekly entertainment newspaper, Starnet is soliciting a marketing representative for its entertainment division, amongst numerous other posted jobs. ""Do you have the ability to 'think outside the curve'?,"" Starnet asks in its porn-peddler posting. The company states that this position requires strategic thinking and implementation, directly relating to Redlight.com and Adultv.com. 

Queasy web-surfers may want to take a pass on these sites, at least Redlight.com, which offers a much harder-core home page than Starnet's main porn sites, Sizzler.com and Chisel.com. Redlight.com's home page offers an extremely explicit mix of ""teaser"" shots, including a graphic live-sex video clip. While Starnet wants to dump its porn business, its latest ad seeks a marketer to maintain continual market research of new forms of advertising and demographics, with ""overall participation in the team effort."" The Thursday recruitment ad came three days after Starnet's Monday disclosure that it hopes to quickly auction off its adult entertainment division assets, with documentation to be complete in 30 days. 

This Redlight.com site happens to be the same Starnet site targeted by the police in their proposed single criminal count of adult pornography. While no charges have yet been laid against Starnet or any directors or employees, the ""information to obtain,"" a court-filed document supporting the search warrant, notes eight proposed counts, including one of possession, for the purpose of publication, distribution or circulation, computerized pictures depicting obscene acts. The police note that ""Fetish,"" one of Redlight.com's seven sections, shows 84 images of nude bondage, women with clamps on body parts, women with horse bridles and bits in their mouths, and women hanging by their arms from straps or belts. 

The latest Starnet recruitment ad also suggests it is ""business as usual"" at Starnet, despite the week-ago raid by more than 100 officers from the RCMP, CLEU, the Ontario Provincial Police, the United States Customs Service and the U.S. Internal Revenue Service. 

The Georgia Straight ad seeks a WorldBroadcasts.com manager, an Internet marketing manager, HTML programmers, graphic designers, an investor relations administrative assistant, an adminstrative assistant of production and sports odds analysts. Starnet seeks ""open-minded, innovative people who enjoy working in a dynamic, fun, team atmosphere and are able to work creatively under pressure."" 

""BREAKING: @HillaryClinton's E-Mail Server Company Got Almost $1 Million In Gov't Loans After Wiping E-Mails   
OCTOBER 26, 2016  
BY CHARLES C. JOHNSON 6 COMMENTS  
Give it up already. It's over. K. J. Gillenwater was the primary researcher behind this story. 

Hillary Clinton's e-mail server company got almost $1 million in government loans starting immediately after they were secretly asked to wipe Hillary Clinton's name from her e-mails. 

Platte River Networks (PRN) got a $493,000 loan from the Small Business Administration in August 2014 and another $350,000 loan in September 2015: 

Public government data available as USAspending.gov 

The first half-million dollar loan arrived not one month after PRN employee Paul Combetta was caught accidentally revealing his company was deleting evidence at Hillary's request in July 2014 . 

The second $350,000 loan came about one year later.

After getting the first loan, PRN moved to a large office space after previously working out of the owner‚Äôs condo. The head of the Small Business Administration is Maria Contreras-Sweet , a Mexican immigrant who was appointed to the office by Barack Obama two months before Hillary's PRN got the first loan. 

WikiLeaks leaks have proven Hillary's corrupt pay-to-play scheme. GotNews has shined a light on how Hillary gets favors from Hispanic and Democratic government bureaucrats before . 

Did Hillary Clinton pay her e-mail server company Platte River Networks (PRN) with almost $1 million in favorable government loans ‚Äî given out by a political friendly ‚Äî in order to alter her illegal e-mails and get her name off them? 

It sure looks like it. 

A Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) request has been lodged for more information.

""Police conclude search of Starnet   
CBC News Posted: Aug 24, 1999 11:26 AM ET Last Updated: Aug 24, 1999 11:26 AM ET  
Police have wrapped up several days of searching the offices of Starnet Communications in Vancouver. They entered the company offices and homes of some directors on Friday. 

Police were looking for evidence of illegal gambling, distributing child pornography, and money laundering. Since the raid, Starnet officials say police just don't understand their business. 

The search warrant details 18 months of police investigation. It traces a network of companies registered in American and Caribbean jurisdictions. 

The warrant also identifies Vancouver as the centre of Starnet's operations, even though this is a grey under Canadian law. 

Police note that Starnet's revenues grew dramatically in the past two years, from betting and sex shows and from lucrative licensing agreements for its gaming software. The investigations and pornography from company sites were grounds for Friday's raid and seizure of company materials. 

RCMP Constable Peter Thiessen says investigators left Starnet offices yesterday morning. He says, ""They spent the better part of three days going through the business. And as a result of that search the investigation is continuing, but no charges have been laid."" Starnet's many investors were spooked by the raid. Share prices dropped almost 70-percent on Friday. However, the company insists the raid had minimal effect on its operation. Stocks rose slightly yesterday after a day of very heavy trading. 

In written statements, company CEO Mark Dohlen said the Wall Street Journal calls Starnet the leader in Internet gaming and entertainment. He says companies like his, those on the cutting edge, are often misunderstood. Yesterday, Starnet announced it will sell off the sex side of its business. It plans to focus more resources on gaming. 

The Police investigation is expected to last for several more months.""

""July 7, 2016 Developments in PKI occurred in the early 1970s at the British intelligence agency GCHQ , where James Ellis , Clifford Cocks and others made important discoveries related to encryption algorithms and key distribution.[ 19 ] However, as developments at GCHQ are highly classified, the results of this work were kept secret and not publicly acknowledged until the mid-1990s. 

The public disclosure of both secure key exchange and asymmetric key algorithms in 1976 by Diffie, Hellman , Rivest, Shamir , and Adleman changed secure communications entirely. With the further development of high-speed digital electronic communications (the Internet and its predecessors), a need became evident for ways in which users could securely communicate with each other, and as a further consequence of that, for ways in which users could be sure with whom they were actually interacting.

""Opened in 1994 as the successor to the Transitional Immigrant Visa Processing Center in Rosslyn, Va., the NVC centralizes all immigrant visa pre-processing and appointment scheduling for overseas posts. The NVC collects paperwork and fees before forwarding a case, ready for adjudication, to the responsible post. 

The center also handles immigrant and fianc√© visa petitions, and while it does not adjudicate visa applications, it provides technical assistance and support to visa-adjudicating consular officials overseas. 

Only two Foreign Service officers, the director and deputy director, work at the center, along with just five Civil Service employees. They work with almost 500 contract employees doing preprocessing of visas, making the center one of the largest employers in the Portsmouth area. 

The contractor, Serco , Inc., has worked with the NVC since its inception and with the Department for almost 18 years. 

The NVC houses more than 2.6 million immigrant visa files, receives almost two million pieces of mail per year and received more than half a million petitions from the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Service (USCIS) in 2011. Its file rooms' high-density shelves are stacked floor-to-ceiling with files, each a collection of someone‚Äôs hopes and dreams and each requiring proper handling. ‚Ä¶. 

The NVC also preprocesses the chief of mission (COM) application required for the filing of a petition for a Special Immigrant Visa (SIV).

The attacks, which drew widespread global condemnation, began on Wednesday, 26 November and lasted until Saturday, 29 November 2008, killing 164 people and wounding at least 308.[2][ 14 ]

""THE CASE OF THE VANISHING VISA FILES  
December 25, 2009 10:00:00 PM PST  
By Chuck Goudie   
December 16, 2009 (CHICAGO) -- Potentially important evidence has disappeared in a terrorism case involving two Chicago men. Their visa records vanished from Chicago's Indian consulate. It comes one week after the ABC 7 I-Team raised questions about how David Coleman Headley and Tahawwur Rana obtained their foreign visas in the first place. 

The case of the vanishing visa records has churned up diplomats from Mumbai to Michigan Avenue. India's foreign secretary Nirupama Rao told reporters overseas Wednesday that she wants answers from Chicago's Indian consulate about the records and visa documents that have disappeared, records that might show how two accused Chicago terrorists obtained permission to scout targets in India. 

Top officials of Chicago's India consulate wouldn't talk to the I-Team on camera last week when asked how terror suspects David Coleman Headley and Tahawwur Rana obtained five-year, unlimited passage visas to India. 

And the consul general did not return calls Wednesday regarding the paperwork they used to process Headley and Rana's visas, which Indian Foreign Secretary Nirupama Rao announced Wednesday have disappeared. 

Wednesday evening, the Chicago consul general emailed a statement to the I-Team that conflicted with government statements made in India. The brief statement read: ""We have not reported loss of any papers regarding issuance of visa to David Coleman Headley and Tahawwur Rana Hussain. Relevant information concerning the issuance of visa to these persons is available with the Government of India"". 

India's counterpart to the FBI is looking into the visa application process as part of its probe into the 2008 Mumbai massacre. 

The two Chicago suspects are accused of having roles in the assault. Rana was denied bond by a Chicago district judge Tuesday, despite family members and friends offering $1 million in cash and property. Rana has not been directly charged with the Mumbai attack that left 175 dead, but was linked to the assault in government court filings. 

Headley, a Pakistan-born Chicagoan, is a convicted heroin dealer whose birth name was Daood Giliani. He changed his name to ease travel to India, according to federal prosecutors in Chicago and to avoid the required pre-visa background check by Indian authorities. 

Since the time Headley and Rani were processed, India's Chicago consulate office began contracting out visa requests to a private company called Travisa Outsourcing that on its website claims, ""We have revolutionized the way people get their visas."" 

And the new visa processing was subject of a news conference last year. 

""The advantages of outsourcing is the Travisa company, which is handling the outsourcing, has set up a call center,"" said Ashok Kumar Attri, consul general. 

Foreign Secretary Rao said she is impressed with the cooperation the US has given to Indian investigators. Headley and Rana are not due back in court until January."" 

""Was Bernardine Dohrn the Mentor of Michelle Obama at Sidley Austin?  
April 22, 2008  
Bernardine Dohrn was at Sidley Austin a law firm in Chicago from From 1984 to 1988, Dohrn was employed by the law firm Sidley Austin, although her criminal record has prevented her from being admitted to either the New York or Illinois bar. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bernardine_Dohrn 

Michelle Obama graduated from Harvard Law School in 1988. But she likely also was a summer associate in 1987 and likely 1986. Barack Obama was assigned to her in 1989 when he was a summer associate from Harvard Law School. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barack_Obama 

He entered Harvard Law School in 1988.[9] More links and excerpts:

Michelle's Princeton thesis: 
http://blog.vdare.com/archives/2008/02/22/michelle-obama-thesis-found-download-it-here/   

James Fulford quotes Politico 

Michelle Obama's senior year thesis at Princeton University, obtained exclusively from the campaign by Politico , shows a document written by a young woman grappling with a society in which a black Princeton alumnus might only be allowed to remain ""on the periphery."" Read the full thesis here: Part 1 , Part 2 , Part 3 , Part 4 . Michelle Obama thesis was on racial divide ‚Äì Jeffrey Ressner ‚Äì Politico.com 

Sidley Austin likely recognized this in Michelle even if she didn't show them her Princeton thesis. Who better at Sidley Austin to be mentor to the author of this Princeton thesis than Bernardine Dohrn who had been number 2 on the FBI most wanted list? 

Barack Obama was assigned to Michelle Obama in summer 1989. This may have reflected how few blacks there were at Sidley Austin, especially from Harvard Law School or the equivalent. Dohrn got her J.D. from University of Chicago Law School. Since she is a prof at Northwestern despite her background, we might infer she was very smart and understanding. So she was the perfect person to be the mentor for Michelle Obama at Sidley Austin.

Hillary Clinton's e-mail server company got almost $1 million in government loans starting immediately after they were secretly asked to wipe Hillary Clinton's name from her e-mails. 

Platte River Networks (PRN) got a $493,000 loan from the Small Business Administration in August 2014 and another $350,000 loan in September 2015:

The first half-million dollar loan arrived not one month after PRN employee Paul Combetta was caught accidentally revealing his company was deleting evidence at Hillary's request in July 2014 . 

The second $350,000 loan came about one year later.

""Police conclude search of Starnet   
CBC News Posted: Aug 24, 1999 11:26 AM ET Last Updated: Aug 24, 1999 11:26 AM ET  
Police have wrapped up several days of searching the offices of Starnet Communications in Vancouver. They entered the company offices and homes of some directors on Friday. 

Police were looking for evidence of illegal gambling, distributing child pornography, and money laundering. Since the raid, Starnet officials say police just don't understand their business. 

The search warrant details 18 months of police investigation. It traces a network of companies registered in American and Caribbean jurisdictions. 

The warrant also identifies Vancouver as the centre of Starnet's operations, even though this is a grey under Canadian law. 

Police note that Starnet's revenues grew dramatically in the past two years, from betting and sex shows and from lucrative licensing agreements for its gaming software. The investigations and pornography from company sites were grounds for Friday's raid and seizure of company materials. 

RCMP Constable Peter Thiessen says investigators left Starnet offices yesterday morning. He says, ""They spent the better part of three days going through the business. And as a result of that search the investigation is continuing, but no charges have been laid."" Starnet's many investors were spooked by the raid. Share prices dropped almost 70-percent on Friday. However, the company insists the raid had minimal effect on its operation. Stocks rose slightly yesterday after a day of very heavy trading. 

In written statements, company CEO Mark Dohlen said the Wall Street Journal calls Starnet the leader in Internet gaming and entertainment. He says companies like his, those on the cutting edge, are often misunderstood. Yesterday, Starnet announced it will sell off the sex side of its business. It plans to focus more resources on gaming. 

The Police investigation is expected to last for several more months.""

""July 7, 2016 Developments in PKI occurred in the early 1970s at the British intelligence agency GCHQ , where James Ellis , Clifford Cocks and others made important discoveries related to encryption algorithms and key distribution.[ 19 ] However, as developments at GCHQ are highly classified, the results of this work were kept secret and not publicly acknowledged until the mid-1990s. 

The public disclosure of both secure key exchange and asymmetric key algorithms in 1976 by Diffie, Hellman , Rivest, Shamir , and Adleman changed secure communications entirely. With the further development of high-speed digital electronic communications (the Internet and its predecessors), a need became evident for ways in which users could securely communicate with each other, and as a further consequence of that, for ways in which users could be sure with whom they were actually interacting. 

Assorted cryptographic protocols were invented and analyzed within which the new cryptographic primitives could be effectively used. With the invention of the World Wide Web and its rapid spread, the need for authentication and secure communication became still more acute. Commercial reasons alone (e.g., e-commerce, online access to proprietary databases from web browsers) were sufficient. Taher Elgamal and others at Netscape developed the SSL protocol ('https' in Web URLs); it included key establishment, server authentication (prior to v3, one-way only), and so on. A PKI structure was thus created for Web users/sites wishing secure communications. 

Vendors and entrepreneurs saw the possibility of a large market, started companies (or new projects at existing companies), and began to agitate for legal recognition and protection from liability. An American Bar Association technology project published an extensive analysis of some of the foreseeable legal aspects of PKI operations (see ABA digital signature guidelines), and shortly thereafter, several U.S. states (Utah being the first in 1995) and other jurisdictions throughout the world began to enact laws and adopt regulations. Consumer groups raised questions about privacy, access, and liability considerations, which were more taken into consideration in some jurisdictions than in others. 

The enacted laws and regulations differed, there were technical and operational problems in converting PKI schemes into successful commercial operation, and progress has been much slower than pioneers had imagined it would be. 

By the first few years of the 21st century, the underlying cryptographic engineering was clearly not easy to deploy correctly. Operating procedures (manual or automatic) were not easy to correctly design (nor even if so designed, to execute perfectly, which the engineering required). The standards that existed were insufficient. 

PKI vendors have found a market, but it is not quite the market envisioned in the mid-1990s, and it has grown both more slowly and in somewhat different ways than were anticipated.[20] PKIs have not solved some of the problems they were expected to, and several major vendors have gone out of business or been acquired by others. PKI has had the most success in government implementations; the largest PKI implementation to date is the Defense Information Systems Agency (DISA) PKI infrastructure for the Common Access Cards program.""

""Benghazi consulate attackers used military-style tactics, say US officials  
Experts still unsure whether assault that killed 4 Americans in Libya could have been prevented  
BY MATT APUZZO AND KIMBERLY DOZIER   
September 22, 2012, 1:44 am 1 WASHINGTON (AP) ‚Äî The heavily armed extremists who laid siege to the US Consulate in Libya used military-style tactics that may have steered Americans toward a waiting ambush, US officials said Friday as they pieced together details about how the compound was overrun. 

US intelligence indicates that 50 or more people, many of them masked, were responsible for the Sept. 11 assault on the US diplomatic mission in Benghazi. Gun trucks provided added firepower. The attackers set up a perimeter, controlling access in and out of the compound. A first wave of attacks sent the Americans fleeing to a fallback building, where a second group of extremists beset them with precise mortar fire. 

Intelligence reports were still coming in, but officials told The Associated Press that what may have initially seemed like a protest over an anti-Islam movie that had spun out of control now showed the hallmarks of a more sophisticated operation. 

In a country coming off a civil war, a level of battlefield savvy does not prove the attack on the compound was planned well in advance. How much planning went into the operation and whether it could have been detected or prevented remain unanswered questions, officials said. 

The attacks killed Ambassador Chris Stevens, diplomat Sean Smith and two former Navy SEALs, who US officials said were security officers guarding diplomatic officials. Stevens was visiting Benghazi from Tripoli to preside over the opening of an ‚ÄúAmerican Space‚Äù cultural center. 

The officials spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss intelligence reports. They stressed that even now authorities do not have a clear understanding of exactly what happened in Benghazi. FBI agents from New York and Washington were in Libya investigating the attack. 

""What happened in Benghazi was a terrorist attack,"" Secretary of State Hillary Clinton said Friday. ""And we will not rest until we have tracked down and brought to justice the terrorists who murdered four Americans."" 

Officials have not singled out one responsible group, but have focused their attention on Ansar al-Shariah, a Libyan militant group led by a former detainee at the US military-run prison in Guantanamo Bay, Cuba. 

Since the civil war that ousted Libyan dictator Moammar Gadhafi last year, the country has been awash with rebels, militias and terrorists. Weaponry is easy to come by, both from the former regime, from weapons depots looted during the war, and from foreign powers that armed the rebellion. The origin of the weapons used in the assault on the US compound was unclear, officials said.""

ABSTRACT  
A full-size mortar training device which includes full-size, simulated, propelling charges is disclosed. Both 81 mm and 60 mm mortar training devices are disclosed. The device provides realistic training on virtually all aspects of mortar firing. The device allows training in target sight acquisition and mortar positioning (elevation and azimuth), sight reacquisition due to recoil, dropping a round, adjusting the number of charges, as required, to achieve a desired zone of firing distance, adjusting the projectile fuse setting to control time of explosion, provides realistic firing sound, and allows trainees to follow procedures similar to those used with standard mortar service ammunition. The device includes a cartridge projectile which contacts a pad within and at the lowermost point of the mortar barrel which is not propelled from the mortar barrel and which provides data to a computer system to determine if an area or object would have been impacted by the mortar projectile, provides analysis of trainee firing errors and provides for the simulation to be replayed for trainee instructional and other purposes. The 60 mm device includes a hand-held firing option and the 81 mm device includes a blast attenuator device to further enhance the realism of the simulation.""

Command/Control Post Exercises These are designed primarily to exercise the senior leadership and support staff in collective planning and decision making within a strategic grouping. Ideally such exercises would be run from the real command and control locations and using their communications and information systems [Feeling lucky, Punk?] . This could include a mix of locations and varying levels of technical simulation support. The Gold Standard system is flexible to allow the tempo and intensity to be adjusted to ensure maximum training benefit, or to fully test and evaluate the most important aspects of a plan. Such exercises also test information flow, communications, equipment, procedures, decision making and coordination. Live Exercises These can range from testing individual components of a system or organisation through to a full-scale rehearsal. They are particularly useful where there are regulatory requirements or with high-risk situations. They are more complex and costly to organise and deliver but can be integrated with Command Post Exercises as part of a wider exercising package.""

""July 7, 2016 Developments in PKI occurred in the early 1970s at the British intelligence agency GCHQ , where James Ellis , Clifford Cocks and others made important discoveries related to encryption algorithms and key distribution.[ 19 ] However, as developments at GCHQ are highly classified, the results of this work were kept secret and not publicly acknowledged until the mid-1990s. 

The public disclosure of both secure key exchange and asymmetric key algorithms in 1976 by Diffie, Hellman , Rivest, Shamir , and Adleman changed secure communications entirely. With the further development of high-speed digital electronic communications (the Internet and its predecessors), a need became evident for ways in which users could securely communicate with each other, and as a further consequence of that, for ways in which users could be sure with whom they were actually interacting. 

Assorted cryptographic protocols were invented and analyzed within which the new cryptographic primitives could be effectively used. With the invention of the World Wide Web and its rapid spread, the need for authentication and secure communication became still more acute. Commercial reasons alone (e.g., e-commerce, online access to proprietary databases from web browsers) were sufficient. Taher Elgamal and others at Netscape developed the SSL protocol ('https' in Web URLs); it included key establishment, server authentication (prior to v3, one-way only), and so on. A PKI structure was thus created for Web users/sites wishing secure communications. 

Vendors and entrepreneurs saw the possibility of a large market, started companies (or new projects at existing companies), and began to agitate for legal recognition and protection from liability. An American Bar Association technology project published an extensive analysis of some of the foreseeable legal aspects of PKI operations (see ABA digital signature guidelines), and shortly thereafter, several U.S. states (Utah being the first in 1995) and other jurisdictions throughout the world began to enact laws and adopt regulations. Consumer groups raised questions about privacy, access, and liability considerations, which were more taken into consideration in some jurisdictions than in others. 

The enacted laws and regulations differed, there were technical and operational problems in converting PKI schemes into successful commercial operation, and progress has been much slower than pioneers had imagined it would be. 

By the first few years of the 21st century, the underlying cryptographic engineering was clearly not easy to deploy correctly. Operating procedures (manual or automatic) were not easy to correctly design (nor even if so designed, to execute perfectly, which the engineering required). The standards that existed were insufficient. 

PKI vendors have found a market, but it is not quite the market envisioned in the mid-1990s, and it has grown both more slowly and in somewhat different ways than were anticipated.[20] PKIs have not solved some of the problems they were expected to, and several major vendors have gone out of business or been acquired by others. PKI has had the most success in government implementations; the largest PKI implementation to date is the Defense Information Systems Agency (DISA) PKI infrastructure for the Common Access Cards program.""

DOJ's Loretta Lynch Tried To Squash Comey's Letter To Congress,"Source: Zero Hedge 

by Tyler Durden
Oct 29, 2016 

Last night a leaked memo was revealed, indicating FBI director James Comey's stated reasons for reopening the Clinton email probe upon discovering what now appear to be tens of thousands of Huma Abedin emails located on Anthony Weiner's notebook. Comey revealed two core reasons for the action: a sense of obligation to lawmakers and a concern that word of the new email discovery would leak to the media and raise questions of a coverup. What he did not reveal, and as has emerged overnight from a report by the New Yorker's Jane Mayer, is that Comey also acted in contravention to DOJ practices, and more importantly, acted contrary to the ""preference"" of DOJ head Loretta Lynch, whose infamous meeting with Bill Clinton on the Phoenix tarmac at the end of June will likely be reassessed in light of these latest revelations. 


According to the New Yorker, ""Comey's decision to make public new evidence that may raise additional legal questions about Clinton was contrary to the views of the Attorney General, according to a well-informed Administration official. Lynch expressed her preference that Comey follow the department's longstanding practice of not commenting on ongoing investigations, and not taking any action that could influence the outcome of an election, but he said that he felt compelled to do otherwise. "" 
Traditionally, the Justice Department has advised prosecutors and law enforcement to avoid any appearance of meddling in the outcome of elections, even if it means holding off on pressing cases . One former senior official recalled that Janet Reno, the Attorney General under Bill Clinton, ""completely shut down the prosecution of a politically sensitive criminal target prior to an election . ""She was adamant‚Äîanything that could influence the election had to go dark,"" the former official said. Please go to Zero Hedge to read the entire article. ",1

"Do Not Forgive the MSM; Alt-Media, Our Job Is Not Over","Jimstone.is 
October 29 2016 

DO NOT FORGIVE THE MSM 

The MSM turned on Hillary. The FBI turned on Hillary. WANT TO KNOW WHY? Because in Florida, where they flipped a HUGE number of votes, Trump still had 68 percent of the vote. Nationwide they did not have the vote scam machines everywhere, and when that got averaged in, Trump took 82 percent of the votes nationwide EVEN WITH THE STOLEN VOTES SUBTRACTED FROM THE AVERAGE. THE FBI, FOX, CNN, EVERYONE ELSE KNEW THE GIG WAS UP, AND IS NOW ONLY MOVING TO SAY ""SORRY"" SO THEY DON'T GO TO JAIL. 

Well, I've got news for you: they are still the same lying despicable malfunctioning trash scum they always were; THEY SHOWED THEIR WORTH, and we would be IDIOTS to forgive them, no matter how badly they burn Hillary. 

CNN is despicable trash; we all witnessed it. NEVER FORGIVE THEM , because they have proven their worth already. No matter what they do, they can't recover from what they have done: they are garbage, a disease, bleach-worthy filth, and I hope Trump ERASES THEM. DITTO FOR ALL of the rest of the MSM, including The Huffington Post, Snopes, ABC-CBS-FOX-YOUNAMEIT ‚Äì ALL of them are the lowest of filth that is now heading for the darkness of the nearest sewer to get away from the coming bulldozer. 

THE FBI is a trash agency, along with the rest of American intelligence, which only works to serve the enemy for as long as it thinks its head will not be cut off. ALL of the FBI MUST BE DISBANDED and EVERYONE in the FBI should be blackballed and never allowed to work again, with the top echelons jailed for life for treason. THEY LIED ABOUT 9-11 AND THEY KNEW IT , and have proven they serve one purpose: to protect evil. Ditto for the CIA, the NSA, the DHS, the TSA, and all the rest of the trash. All of it needs to go; there is not one fragment of it that should be salvaged. 

So they are all running like rats for cover: they know they blew it, they know they are going to be bagged for heinous crimes against America. Now they are putting on the biggest fakest show the world will ever witness. As if they cared! They never did care, and I hope to God Trump has a memory longer than the average jarhead and bags every last one of them when he has his day. They had BETTER run for the gates and ditch the country just like they said they would if he got elected ‚Äì because if not, they are heading straight to the gates of justice. 

I would like to thank everyone in the alt-media who made this happen. And I would also like to say that I said it all along as it was and NEVER backed off: Hillary never had more than 8 percent national support. This is something I said repeatedly: that Trump was always 80+ percent supported, and I never wavered and never once posted bullshit like OH, LET'S REJOICE, TRUMP IS AT 51 PERCENT! That was always a trap ‚Äì a scam, to justify stealing the election ‚Äì and I called it as it was. 

Our job is not over 

The rot is there. It is deeply rooted, with fungus roots running all the way through the country. One bottle of bleach is not going to do more than spot-clean the surface. We won this battle, and it is NOT time to sit down. The alt-media cannot rest until CNN and all of the rest of the MSM is either bankrupted or jailed. The alt-media CANNOT rest for as long as Google is allowed to wage war on websites like this one by refusing to allow it ads. If this website were allowed ads, it would easily self-fund with $12,000 plus per month (and would probably have more than $24,000 per month). Denial of ads just because someone disagrees and has a monopoly established via full control of various ad firms is a flagrant violation of antitrust laws, and has to be stopped dead cold. 

The alt-media cannot stop until every last criminal in the FBI is jailed BY THE FBI. I am sick of the bait tactics and false flag psyops fronted by that agency: heads have GOT TO ROLL, PILES OF THEM, especially since it has been proven that it was the FBI itself that did the first World Trade Center bombing, with the full intent to bring one of the towers down. That's the type of agency that has got to be shuttered ‚Äì or we are all toast, Trump or not. Yeah, I know YOU, at the FBI, are reading this. GO TO HELL. 

Our job will not be over until the CIA is cleaned out. Our job is not over until the American Bar Association is disbanded as the criminal bloodsucking hive it is. Our job is not over until the top executives at the medical companies that produced the tainted autism-inflicting vaccines hang with stretched necks. Our job will not be over until every last liberal arts and women's studies department of all universities have their staffs jailed for treason. They gutted the home front in a manner which was horrific beyond belief. Our job is not over until all of America's great libraries are fully restored after being totally wiped out by the Jews, and ALL scientific journals and works once again become fully free and public domain. Our job will not be over until the child-snatching CPS is shut down and their feed for their slave trade is cut off. Our job will not be over until American corporations begin to fight for America, and bring our jobs and American quality back. 

The list of what the alt-media needs to accomplish now that it appears the first huge battle has been won is practically endless. But I believe the alt-media is up to the task, and will succeed as long as ONE THING IS CEMENTED IN STONE: 



JULIAN ASSANGE IS OBVIOUSLY DEAD. 

Consider these facts, and then figure the odds of him being alive: 

1. Wikileaks' DNS server was suddenly pointed elsewhere. That's right: that night, in the wee hours of the morning after Pamela was there (to poison him), police in an armored vehicle showed up at the embassy; and THAT NIGHT, the DNS server pointed to a different IP address for Wikileaks, and GOOGLE updated everything instantly, so the transfer was completely seamless from the real Wikileaks server to the fake Wikileaks server that was at a completely different IP address. 

2. Mr. Assange's subsequent tweets were noticeably more hostile and attacked his most loyal supporters. I reported this repeatedly. 

3. Mr. Assange's tweets regularly misspelled the names of some of his closest friends whom he has known for decades (Gavin McFadyen became McFayden, for example). McFadyen, 76, the director of Wikileaks, was found dead three days after Assange started having mystery problems. This is something I made a huge issue of here. 

4. Streams of disinformation were spewed. 

5. Themes supported by Mr. Assange for years were then knocked down or discredited by his subsequent tweets and communications. Very bad timing with that. Everyone with a brain noticed this, and it lit up the forums and blogs. 

6. ""Body double"" rumors have been circulated and documented. 

7. New, strange, hitherto unknown moderators of Wikileaks have suddenly been installed. 

8. His ""deadman switch"" WAS ACTIVATED BEFORE THE ARMORED VEHICLE EVEN SHOWED UP AT THE EMBASSY, which means Assange probably manually triggered it after he figured out he was poisoned. Much of his stored data and secret website PINs were to be released in the event of his untimely death (I released both deadman switches here, one encrypted and one unencrypted). 

All of this happened right after Pamela Anderson showed up with a lunch that was no doubt poisoned, and the media talked all about how Assange was ""pale"" and ""not feeling well"" when she left, and that he said the food Pamela brought him was ""torture"". Good for a laugh in the inside circles to have this go out on the MSM, no doubt. 

MY TAKE: ASSANGE WAS POISONED, AND THEN REMOVED FROM THE EMBASSY IN AN ARMORED VEHICLE. This was clearly visible in a live feed someone set up that night because something was amiss, and I saw that and stayed up the entire night for it. That is why I so strongly stated that he can't possibly still be at the embassy. Perhaps he got medical care to save him and is now being waterboarded. 

If the new ""wikileak releases"" are real, they are NOT coming from the Wikileaks server ‚Äì only a re-direct to a different server in the name of Wikileaks. The IP address change proves it, and we can only hope it is white hats doing it. It seems so, but one can only guess.

Is This Why Comey Broke: A Stack Of Resignation Letters From Furious FBI Agents,"Source: Zero Hedge 

October 30, 2016

Conspiracy theories have swirled in recent days as to why FBI Director James Comey reopened Hillary's email investigation after just closing it back in July concluding that, although Hillary had demonstrated gross negligence in her establishment of a private email server, that ""no reasonable prosecutor"" would bring a case against her. Democrats, after lavishing Comey with praise for months on concluding his investigation in an ""impartial"" way, have since lashed out at him for seeking to influence the 2016 election cycle with Hillary herself describing his recent actions as ""deeply troubling"". Republicans, on the other hand, have praised Comey's recent efforts as an attempt to correct a corrupt investigation that seemingly ignored critical evidence while granting numerous immunity agreements to Clinton staffers. 

According to the Daily Mail , and a source close to James Comey, the decision, at least in part, came after he ""could no longer resist mounting pressure by mutinous agents in the FBI"" who ""felt that he betrayed them and brought disgrace on the bureau by letting Hillary off with a slap on the wrist."" 
James Comey's decision to revive the investigation of Hillary Clinton's email server and her handling of classified material came after he could no longer resist mounting pressure by mutinous agents in the FBI , including some of his top deputies, according to a source close to the embattled FBI director. 

'The atmosphere at the FBI has been toxic ever since Jim announced last July that he wouldn't recommend an indictment against Hillary,' said the source, a close friend who has known Comey for nearly two decades, shares family outings with him, and accompanies him to Catholic mass every week. 

'Some people, including department heads, stopped talking to Jim, and even ignored his greetings when they passed him in the hall,' said the source. 'They felt that he betrayed them and brought disgrace on the bureau by letting Hillary off with a slap on the wrist.' 

According to the source, Comey fretted over the problem for months and discussed it at great length with his wife, Patrice. 

He told his wife that he was depressed by the stack of resignation letters piling up on his desk from disaffected agents. The letters reminded him every day that morale in the FBI had hit rock bottom. 

'The people he trusts the most have been the angriest at him,' the source continued. 'And that includes his wife, Pat. She kept urging him to admit that he had been wrong when he refused to press charges against the former secretary of state. Though we're sure there are many facets behind Comey's decision making process, we can all be quite certain, at this point, that he's not motivated by a desire to make friends having now alienated just about everyone in Washington, both in law enforcement and in both political parties. In fact, after Tim Kaine just last week praised Comey as a ""wonderful"" career public servant with the ""highest standards of integrity""....

"" Robert William ""Willie"" Pickton (born October 24, 1949)[ 2 ] of Port Coquitlam , British Columbia , Canada, is a former multi-millionaire pig farmer[ 3 ] and serial killer convicted in 2007 of the second-degree murders of six women.[4][ 5 ] He was also charged in the deaths of an additional twenty women,[6] many of them from Vancouver's Downtown Eastside; however, these charges were stayed by the Crown in 2010.[7] In December 2007, he was sentenced to life in prison, with no possibility of parole for 25 years ‚Äì the longest sentence then available under Canadian law for murder.[8] 

During the trial's first day of jury evidence, January 22, 2007, the Crown stated he confessed to 49 murders to an undercover police officer posing as a cellmate . The Crown reported that Pickton told the officer that he wanted to kill another woman to make it an even 50, and that he was caught because he was ""sloppy"".[9] Background[edit] 

By 1992, Robert William Pickton and his brother David owned a Port Coquitlam farm. Worker Bill Hiscox called it a ""creepy-looking place"", noting that it was patrolled by a 600-lb. (270 kg) boar , one of the few actual pigs on the farm. ""I never saw a pig like that, who would chase you and bite at you,"" he said. ""It was running out with the dogs around the property."" He later described Pickton as a ""pretty quiet guy, hard to strike up a conversation with,"" whose occasionally bizarre behavior, despite no evidence of substance abuse , would draw attention. 

Pickton's only vehicle was a converted bus, with deeply tinted windows, to which he was emotionally attached. The Pickton brothers gradually neglected the site's farming operations. They registered a non-profit charity, the Piggy Palace Good Times Society, with the Canadian government in 1996 as aiming to ""organize, co-ordinate, manage and operate special events, functions, dances, shows and exhibitions on behalf of service organizations, sports organizations and other worthy groups."" Its events included raves and wild parties featuring Vancouver prostitutes and gatherings in a converted slaughterhouse. These events attracted as many as 2,000 people. Hell's Angel members were known to often frequent the farm."" 

""650,000 Emails Found On Anthony Weiner's Laptop; DOJ Blocked Foundation Probe   
by Tyler Durden   
Oct 30, 2016 10:34 PM  
Yesterday, we reported that the FBI has found "" tens of thousands of emails "" belonging to Huma Adein on Anthony Weiner's computer, raising questions how practical it is that any conclusive finding will be available or made by the FBI in the few days left before the elections Now, according to the WSJ , it appears that Federal agents are preparing to scour roughly 650,000 emails that, as we reported moments ago were discovered weeks ago on the laptop of Anthony Weiner , to see how many relate to a prior probe of Hillary Clinton's email use, as metadata on the device suggests there may be thousands sent to or from the private server that the Democratic nominee used while she was secretary of state, according to people familiar with the matter. 

As the WSJ adds, the review will take weeks at a minimum to determine whether those messages are work-related emails between Huma Abedin, a close Clinton aide and the estranged wife of Mr. Weiner, and State Department officials; how many are duplicates of emails already reviewed by the Federal Bureau of Investigation; and whether they include either classified information or important new evidence in the Clinton email probe, which FBI officials call ""Midyear."" 

And, as we further reported earlier today , the FBI has had to await a court order to begin reviewing the emails, because they were uncovered in an unrelated probe of Mr. Weiner, and that order was delayed for reasons that remain unclear. 

More stunning is just how many emails were found on Weiner's computer. And while one can only imagine the content of some of the more persona ones, the WSJ writes that the latest development began in early October when New York-based FBI officials notified Andrew McCabe, the bureau's second-in-command, that while investigating Mr. Weiner for possibly sending sexually charged messages to a minor, they had recovered a laptop with 650,000 emails. Many, they said, were from the accounts of Ms. Abedin, according to people familiar with the matter. 

Those emails stretched back years , these people said, and were on a laptop that both Mr. Weiner and Ms. Abedin used and that hadn't previously come up in the Clinton email probe. Ms. Abedin said in late August that the couple were separating. 

The FBI had searched the computer while looking for child pornography, people familiar with the matter said, but the warrant they used didn't give them authority to search for matters related to Mrs. Clinton's email arrangement at the State Department. Mr. Weiner has denied sending explicit or indecent messages to the teenager. 

As reported yesterday, it appears that there are potentially tens of thousands of Abedin linked emails on Weiner's computer: 

In their initial review of the laptop, the metadata showed many messages, apparently in the thousands, that were either sent to or from the private email server at Mrs. Clinton's home that had been the focus of so much investigative effort for the FBI. Senior FBI officials decided to let the Weiner investigators proceed with a closer examination of the metadata on the computer, and report back to them. 

The WSJ then connects the dots between how the Weiner emails were linked to the Clinton reopening of the Clinton probe, despite Loretta Lynch's and the DOJ's vocal urges not to do so : 

At a meeting early last week of senior Justice Department and FBI officials, a member of the department‚Äôs senior national-security staff asked for an update on the Weiner laptop, the people familiar with the matter said. At that point, officials realized that no one had acted to obtain a warrant, these people said. 

Mr. McCabe then instructed the email investigators to talk to the Weiner investigators and see whether the laptop‚Äôs contents could be relevant to the Clinton email probe, these people said. After the investigators spoke, the agents agreed it was potentially relevant. 

Mr. Comey was given an update, decided to go forward with the case and notified Congress on Friday, with explosive results. Senior Justice Department officials had warned Mr. Comey that telling Congress would violate well-established policies against overt actions that could affect an election, and some within the FBI have been unhappy at Mr. Comey's repeated public statements on the probe, going back to his first press conference on the subject in July. 

But wait it gets better. 

Recall that this is the same Andrew Mcabe whose wife the Wall Street Journal reported last week received $467,500 in campaign funds in late 2015 from the political action committee of Virginia Gov. Terry McAuliffe, a longtime ally of the Clintons and, until he was elected governor in November 2013, a Clinton Foundation board member. 

Mr. McAuliffe had supported Dr. McCabe in the hopes she and a handful of other Democrats might help win a majority in the state Senate, giving Mr. McAuliffe more sway in the state capitol. Dr. McCabe lost her race last November, and Democrats failed to win their majority. 

FBI officials have said Mr. McCabe had no role in the Clinton email probe until he became deputy director, and there was no conflict of interest because by then his wife's campaign was over. Which brings us to the second big topic: the Clinton Foundation, and how the DOJ made sure that particular probe never made the light of day. At the same time as the Clinton server was being investigated, other Clinton-related investigations were under way within the FBI, and they have been the subject of internal debate for months. 

Early this year, four FBI field offices‚ÄîNew York, Los Angeles, Washington and Little Rock, Ark.‚Äîwere collecting information about the Clinton Foundation to see if there was evidence of financial crimes or influence-peddling, according to people familiar with the matter. 

The WSJ touches on something fascinating: Los Angeles agents had picked up information about the Clinton Foundation from an unrelated public corruption case and had issued some subpoenas for bank records related to the foundation, these people said. So where did that trail go? Apparently nowhere. 

The Washington field office was probing financial relationships involving Mr. McAuliffe before he became a Clinton Foundation board member, these people said. Mr. McAuliffe has denied any wrongdoing, and his lawyer has said the probe is focused on whether he failed to register as an agent of a foreign entity. The FBI field office in New York had done the most work on the Clinton Foundation case and received help from the FBI field office in Little Rock, the people familiar with the matter said. 

In February, FBI officials made a presentation to the Justice Department, according to these people. By all accounts, the meeting didn't go well. 

Some said that is because the FBI didn‚Äôt present compelling evidence to justify more aggressive pursuit of the Clinton Foundation, and that the career public integrity prosecutors in the room simply believed it wasn't a very strong case. Others said that from the start, the Justice Department officials were stern, icy and dismissive of the case. 

""That was one of the weirdest meetings I've ever been to,"" one participant told others afterward, according to people familiar with the matter. 

Needless to say, the probe into the Foundation faded. 

But back to the Clinton probe, according to a person familiar with the probes, on Aug. 12, a senior Justice Department official called Mr. McCabe to voice his displeasure at finding that New York FBI agents were still openly pursuing the Clinton Foundation probe, despite the department's refusal to allow more aggressive investigative methods in the case. Mr. McCabe said agents still had the authority to pursue the issue as long as they didn‚Äôt use those methods. 

At this point a question emerges: did McCabe seek to defend or press on with a Clinton probe: Mr. McCabe‚Äôs defenders in the agency said that following the call, he repeated the instruction that he had given earlier in the Clinton Foundation investigation: Agents were to keep pursuing the work within the authority they had. 

Others further down the FBI chain of command, however, said agents were given a much starker instruction on the case: ‚ÄúStand down.‚Äù When agents questioned why they weren‚Äôt allowed to take more aggressive steps, they said they were told the order had come from the deputy director‚ÄîMr. McCabe. Others familiar with the matter deny Mr. McCabe or any other senior FBI official gave such a stand-down instruction. 

At this point the two probes, into Hillary's email and the Clinton Foundation converged: 

For agents who already felt uneasy about FBI leadership‚Äôs handling of the Clinton Foundation case, the moment only deepened their concerns, these people said. For those who felt the probe hadn‚Äôt yet found significant evidence of criminal conduct, the leadership‚Äôs approach was the right response to the facts on the ground. 

Things accelerated over the past two months, when in September, agents on the foundation case asked to see the emails contained on nongovernment laptops that had been searched as part of the Clinton email case, but that request was rejected by prosecutors at the Eastern District of New York, in Brooklyn. Those emails were given to the FBI based on grants of partial immunity and limited-use agreements, meaning agents could only use them for the purpose of investigating possible mishandling of classified information. 

Some FBI agents were dissatisfied with that answer, and asked for permission to make a similar request to federal prosecutors in Manhattan, according to people familiar with the matter. Mr. McCabe, these people said, told them no and added that they could not ‚Äúgo prosecutor-shopping."" 

Not long after that discussion, FBI agents informed the bureau‚Äôs leaders about the Weiner laptop, prompting Mr. Comey's disclosure to Congress and setting of the furor that promises to consume the final days of a tumultuous campaign 

While much of the latest developments are known, or could have been inferred assuming more corruption within government agencies, the punchline is that the weeks if not months of upcoming work means that if Clinton wins the White House, she will likely do so amid at least one ongoing investigation into her inner circle being handled by law-enforcement officials who are deeply divided over how to manage such cases. It also means that Trump will be hounding Hilllary for the remainder of the campaign as being the only presidential candidate to seek election with a recently reopened criminal probe hanging over her head.""

Any infrastructure which cuts across multiple agencies requires the cooperation of the affected agencies to make it work. The Federal PKI is no different.

In 1996, the Federal PKI Steering Committee was formed under the Government Information Technology Services Board, co-chaired by OMB and the National Partnership for Reinventing Government (NPR). The Steering Committee, comprising over 50 members representing over two dozen agencies, has as its focus the promotion of interoperable PKI solutions, the development of common guidance, and the sharing of information so that agencies considering or deploying PKI solutions can benefit from those who have already done so.

Insiders Threaten to Expose Hillary's Pedophile Sex Ring!!!,"BREAKING BOMBSHELL! FBI NYPD INSIDERS LEAK - Email Scandal About to Take a SICK and TWISTED Turn    
Source: Victurus Libertas  


All of the following information was given to us by our insiders who have specific first-hand knowledge of the Hillary Clinton email scandal. It seems that things are about to heat up. We are told that of the 662,871 emails lifted from Anthony Weiner's computer, 11,112 emails are Huma Abedin's‚Ä¶ and pay to play ‚Äì including Saudis and Israelis. Meaning Huma was the one Hillary USED to communicate with foreign leaders via email for inside information and deals via Huma's computer. 

It has been established through many avenues, but mainly through Wikileaks, that the Clinton Foundation was just a farce set up in order to perform pay-to-play games with multiple entities, including foreign nations. Pay-to-play nations include: Israel, Saudi Arabia, Turkey, Qatar, Kazakhstan, and the Ukraine. 
Furthermore, we are told by one of our insiders that one email unequivocally confirms ISIS was created by CIA and Israeli Secret Intelligence Service , with help from Joe Lieberman, John McCain, and Lindsey Graham! An NYPD insider said the content they viewed did include State Department TOP SECRET emails. One file was called ""Life Insurance"". A second file was titled "" DNC Nuclear Arsenal "". 

A third file I'm sure Hillary definitely DOES NOT want released was a file labeled ""Intimate"" ‚Ä¶ according to this NYPD insider, this file contained X-rated photos of Huma and Hillary with a TEENAGER . 

NYPD detectives were sickened by what they saw, according to our insider, and they had threatened FBI field agents that they would leak this information, if the FBI did not ""step up and take off the kid gloves"" . At that point, 13 of the FBI agents in NYC were also threatening to leak the information. 

As you can imagine, the scandal has the entire Obama Administration in full panic. We are told there are emails that could send Loretta Lynch to prison , as well as Bill and Hillary. The Twitter post below, our sources sent us, verifying it is all true: 




Even MORE! 

The following information comes straight from an FBI Anonymous source, who is the senior analyst who posted on 4chan in early July of this year: 

Jim Comey learned that some of his own investigators were tipping off both Loretta Lynch and Bill Clinton, thus making his job impossible. 

Comey sent a letter to Congress, knowing that ultimately it would expose Loretta Lynch as a dirty actor and the breadcrumbs would lead directly to Obama . The State Department is terrified now. Comey has assembled a small team of 40 agents, whom he has declared ""The Untouchables"" after the famous federal agent Eliot Ness. 

Comey has clamped down on all FBI agents and he expects a full-scale war between the FBI and the Department of Justice (DOJ), the White House, and the State Department. He has confirmed and understands that many sitting senators, congressmen, lobbyists, and power players are going to be indicted and prosecuted . One of the main targets of the probe is the Clinton Foundation and Clinton Global Initiative. Among the targets under investigation are John Podesta, Huma, Cheryl Mills, CNN, ABC, NBC, etc. 

As it turns out, Weiner, Huma's husband, had been forwarding Huma's emails each time she came home and left her computer open. Huma appears to have been in touch with Saudi actors, and therefore, ESPIONAGE is strongly suspected. 
Comey and his 40 "" Untouchables "" are now preparing to take down the largest corruption ever witnessed in American history‚Ä¶ which is what I think MUST happen if Comey is planning to stay part of the FBI. He lost so much respect and so much credibility with the first Hillary investigation, it would take something of this magnitude to allow him to face the public again. The Pentagon has internal players and outside players they call "" creatives "". Creatives are civilians who tend to be geniuses, malcontents, extreme hackers, or otherwise demonstrate brilliance in other useful areas. A Pentagon program called Cicada 3301 , which we have reported on previously, was created by several of these talented civilians. The program is now used to allow thousands of honest government people to report on their corrupt superiors, using what is called a DEAD BOX whistleblower encryption method so the non-corrupted government officials can report corruption and still remain safe. 

I've heard it said ""A vagina almost took down Bill, now will a Weiner take down Hillary?"" LOL! 

Again, thank you to all of the insiders, the whistleblowers, the good FBI agents, the good CIA agents, the good NYPD officers, and the non-corrupted government officials who want to see the truth exposed! Without these brave, wonderful, and morally erect individuals, our country would still be in the corrupted darkness. 



Vistors to Epstein's Little St. James Island include: 

‚Ä¢ Ehud Barak , the former Prime Minister of Israel (1999-2001) ‚Äì pedophile being procured underage girls by Epstein. Former Israeli Minister of Defense and also Deputy Israeli Prime Minister under Binyamin Netanyahu from 2009 to 2013. 

‚Ä¢ Prince Andrew ‚Äì British royalty ‚Äì Jeffrey Epstein and his girlfriend Ghislaine Maxwell pimped Epstein sex slave Virginia Roberts to Prince Andrew multiple times. The victim girls say Prince Andrew was very sexually sadistic; they despised this sick, twisted creature. 

‚Ä¢ Kevin Spacey ‚Äì actor in House of Cards. People tell me Spacey is gay, and my response is ""Have you ever heard of the word bisexual?"" Spacey is very good friends with 2 big-time pedophiles: Jeffrey Epstein and Bill Clinton. Spacey, big Hollywood star, has 3.78 million Twitter followers. 

‚Ä¢ Alan Dershowitz ‚Äì longtime friend of Epstein, as well as one of his defense lawyers. Dershowitz was the one who negotiated that absurd plea bargain for Epstein that gave him a 13-month (served) sentence and a 16 hour/day day pass so he could spend most of his time in his mansion. Epstein sex slave Virginia Roberts has said that Epstein made her have sex with Dershowitz numerous times. The real question is how many other underage girls was Dershowitz having sex with? Virginia Roberts says Dershowitz also witnessed Epstein's pedophilic activities.

John Key channels NZ taxpeyers' money to Clinton Foundation 


This is information that every taxpayer (or those that care) should know about but our journalists are not doing their job.  

What with warships in our harbour and troops in Iraq this government of John Key is in lockstep with the most corrupt and warmongering part of the US government. 

No doubt Key would approve of the Clinton's defrauding the people of Haiti. It's his style. 

The Cannabis Party is calling on John Key to explain why he gave over $7 million of New Zealand tax-payer's money to the Clinton Foundation.

31 October, 2016 

Wikileaks raised serious ethical concerns about the Clinton Foundation when it published a hacked email, send to Clinton campaign chairman John Podesta, revealing blurred lines between the foundation and the personal financial interests of Bill and Hillary Clinton. 

Cannabis Party leader Julian Crawford said if John Key was serious about HIV prevention, one of the Clinton Foundation's supposed goals, he should legalise medical cannabis in New Zealand. 

""Hundreds of researchers have reported that THC was able to destroy the RIV virus in monkeys. That virus is nearly identical to the HIV virus found in humans,"" he said. 

""John Key has a lot of explaining to do if the Wikileaks revelations about the Clinton Foundation are true."" 

Former Assistant Director of the FBI Thomas Fuentes confirmed that ""the FBI has an intensive investigation ongoing into the Clinton Foundation"". 

New Zealand's National Business Review has reported that John Key will continue giving millions of dollars of taxpayer's money to the foundation in the future, despite the criminal investigation of Hillary Clinton. 

""I've met her on lots of occasions, had dinner with her at Premier House a few times,"" John Key said. 

""As Secretary of State she was great, very engaged with New Zealand."" Broadcaster Duncan Garner yesterday raised serious concerns about the ongoing payments to the Clinton Foundation, known as ""pay-to-play"". 

""We also give money to the Clinton Foundation? Yes, we did. Gosh, who didn't get a handout?"" Garner said. 

""We've been feeding all these guys at the trough for years"" 

""pay-to-play"" refers to operations where Bill and Hillary Clinton rewarded big donors to their foundation with preferential access to the US government.

An explanation for why the FBI re-opened Hillary's e-mails,"Jimstone.is 
October 31 2016 

Huma's husband, Anthony Weiner (which blows the whole Huma/Islam meme into the gutter; all we are seeing with this is the fact the ""Muslims"" running Saudi Arabia are crypto Jews) ‚Äì ANYWAY , Hillary was so sure she'd never be called to account with her e-mails that she was careless enough to have them end up on Weiner's personal laptop in a file he titled ""life insurance"". 

Well, you know how the entire establishment is wrapped up in child sex and other similar crimes, and Weiner ended up getting his laptop seized by the NYPD in a kiddie porn/child sex investigation. When the NYPD went through the laptop, they found Hillary's e-mails in FULL UNADULTERATED PRISTINE FORM. They proved crimes of the highest order ‚Äì at least 15 felonies found so far, with a majority of them related to treason and selling out the country. 

SO THE NYPD OPENED UP A CASE ON HILLARY. The FBI said, NO, WE'LL TAKE THAT ‚Äì and that is the ONLY reason why these investigations got re-opened: because if the NYPD handled it, huge portions of the FBI would be sent to prison. Now the FBI is under pressure to actually do its job, because they know the NYPD knows. No matter what the outcome, the FBI gains zero (0) ZERO credibility points from this. 

So read my report DO NOT FORGIVE : it was BANG ON, they did this because they HAD TO, not because they had any intention at all of being good, and it really is time to drain the swamp. 

Now let's all sit and wait for the suicide of Preet Bharara , the U.S. Prosecuting Attorney for the Southern District of New York, and the NYPD who pushed this into the light. He's now a target of the FBI, the DNC, the Clinton death machine and God knows what else. PREDICTION (and I do not make predictions): THE DIRECTOR OF INVESTIGATIONS FOR THE NYPD WILL ""COMMIT SUICIDE"" WITHIN 5 DAYS. He's a walking dead man. 

The circle of crime in Washington DC is so entrenched and so intertwined that if you poke one part of it, there is a good chance the whole show will fall apart. Poking that monster in a way that hurts is something I do not believe anyone will survive; Preet might as well call himself a zombie. 

The NYPD TRUMPED the FBI! That is why they had to investigate Hillary! 

Well well, the NYPD is what busted the Hillary mails open while they were looking for kiddie stuff on Weiner's laptop, and THAT is why the FBI was forced to investigate Hillary. They had no choice. NYPD TRUMPS FBI!!!

Who Is Peter Kadzik? The Clinton Ally and John Podesta's Very Close Friend Peter Kadzik Who Will Take Charge of DoJ's Hillary Clinton and Huma Abedin Email Probe,"Source: 70News 

October 31, 2016 Updated on November 1, 2016 

‚Ä¢ John Podesta: Kadzik was a ""fantastic lawyer"" who ""kept me out of jail."" 

‚Ä¢ Podesta and Kadzik, the assistant attorney general for legislative affairs, were in frequent contact, other emails show. 

‚Ä¢ Both were classmates at Georgetown Law School in the 1970s, discussed plans to celebrate Podesta's birthday. And in another sent last May, Kadzik's son emailed Podesta asking for a job on the Clinton campaign. 

‚Ä¢ Kadzik lobbied Podesta ( then WH Chief of Staff ) to pardon his billionaire, tax dodger fugitive client Marc Rich, whose wife gave $1 million to the Clintons and other Democrats prior to the pardon. FBI Director James Comey is now trying to do the right thing and correct the deed cleaning up the mud he and Hillary Clinton put all over the face of FBI agency. By reopening Hillary Clinton's case, thanks to 650k-emails linked to sex scandal of Huma Abedin's husband Anthony Weiner and the mutiny of FBI agents who won't put up with Comey's crap, we are suppose to finally get justice. 

But guess what? DOJ assigned a Clinton ally and John Podesta's very close friend Peter Kadzik to take charge of the new investigation. 

In a letter to Congress, the DOJ writes that it ""will continue to work closely with the FBI and together, dedicate all necessary resources and take appropriate steps as expeditiously as possible,"" assistant attorney General Peter J. Kadzik writes in letters to House and Senate lawmakers. 

WHO IS PETER KADZIK? 

According to an excellent article published by DAILY CALLER: 

The day after Hillary Clinton testified in front of the House Select Committee on Benghazi last October, John Podesta, the Democrat's campaign chairman, met for dinner with a small group of well-connected friends, including Peter Kadzik, a top official at the Justice Department. 

The dinner arrangement, revealed in hacked Podesta emails released by WikiLeaks, is just the latest example of an apparent conflict of interest between the Clinton campaign and the federal agency charged with investigating the former secretary of state's email practices. 


Podesta and Kadzik, the assistant attorney general for legislative affairs, were in frequent contact, other emails show. In one email from January, Kadzik and Podesta, who were classmates at Georgetown Law School in the 1970s, discussed plans to celebrate Podesta's birthday. And in another sent last May, Kadzik's son emailed Podesta asking for a job on the Clinton campaign. 

The post-Benghazi dinner was attended by Podesta, Kadzik, superlobbyist Vincent Roberti and other well-placed Beltway fixtures. 

Kadzik, who started at the DOJ in 2013, helped spearhead the effort to nominate Lynch, who was heavily criticized for her secret meeting with the former president. 

In the trenches 

Podesta and Kadzik have a long history ‚Äî one which has largely gone unnoticed during the ongoing Clinton email scandal. 

Kadzik represented Podesta during the Monica Lewinsky investigation. And in the waning days of the Bill Clinton administration, Kadzik lobbied Podesta on behalf of Marc Rich, the fugitive who Bill Clinton controversially pardoned on his last day in office. 

That history is cited by Podesta in another email hacked from his Gmail account. 

In a Sept. 2008 email , which the Washington Free Beacon flagged last week, Podesta emailed an Obama campaign official to recommend Kadzik for a supportive role in the campaign. 

Podesta, who would later head up the Obama White House transition effort, wrote that Kadzik was a ""fantastic lawyer"" who ""kept me out of jail."" 

Podesta had been promoted to Clinton‚Äôs chief of staff when he and Kadzik became embroiled in another scandal. 

Kadzik was then representing Marc Rich, a billionaire financier who was wanted by the U.S. government for evading a $48 million tax bill. The fugitive, who was also implicated in illegal trading activity with nations that sponsored terrorism, had been living in Switzerland for 17 years when he sought the pardon. 

To help Rich, Kadzik lobbied Podesta heavily in the weeks before Clinton left office on Jan. 20, 2001. 

A House Oversight Committee report released in May 2002 stated that ""Kadzik was recruited into Marc Rich's lobbying campaign because he was a long-time friend of White House Chief of Staff John Podesta."" 

The report noted that Kadzik contacted Podesta at least seven times regarding Rich‚Äôs pardon. 

On top of the all-hands-on-deck lobbying effort, Rich's ex-wife, Denise Rich, had doled out more than $1 million to the Clintons and other Democrats prior to the pardon. She gave $100,000 to Hillary Clinton's New York Senate campaign and another $450,000 to the Clinton presidential library.

SOMETHING STINKS (again)! Peter J. Kadzik a Assistant Attorney General having dinner with Podesta WHILE FBI is investigating HRC? Nice! -VJ pic.twitter.com/xVjiRwQMCz ‚Äî RealVinnieJames (@RealVinnieJames) October 30, 2016

The words Extraordinary Claims needs to be banished when talking Extraterrestrials,"The words Extraordinary Claims needs to be banished when talking Extraterrestrials page: 1 link I was reading an article that talked about Extraterrestrials the other day and of course at the end of the article the tired line about Extraordinary measures....blah, blah, blah came out towards the end of the article. This needs to stop when talking about Extraterrestrials. It may have been an extraordinary claim 60 years ago but it's not today. With the scientific evidence we have today, many people including one of the top Scientist of our time has reached the conclusion that Extraterrestrials exist based on the evidence. Hawking said,""Aliens almost certainly exist."" These are conclusions reached based on the evidence not extraordinary claims. The article was on a possible signal that could be of Extraterrestrial origin. This signal matches a prediction made in 2012 and it's just science. This is what was said at the end of the article and it's this type of thinking that needs to stop. With things like water found on other planets, exoplanets in habitable zones, extremophiles in places we thought life couldn't exist, building blocks of life found on comets and more, saying Extraterrestrials exist isn't an extraordinary claim but a possible explanation based on the evidence. Here's what was said. ‚ÄúThe one in 10,000 objects with unusual spectra seen by Borra and Trottier are certainly worthy of additional study,‚Äù the team said in a statement. ‚ÄúHowever, extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence. ‚ÄúIt is too early to unequivocally attribute these purported signals to the activities of extraterrestrial civilizations. Internationally agreed-upon protocols for searches for evidence of advanced life beyond Earth (SETI) require candidates to be confirmed by independent groups using their own telescopes, and for all natural explanations to be exhausted before invoking extraterrestrial agents as an explanation. www.independent.co.uk... First, the Scientist who are behind this study never said UNEQUIVOCALLY. This is an old tactic that's used by some people on this board from time to time. They can't debate the evidence presented so they try to make it seem as you made a blanket sstatement. The Scientist say ""PROBABLY"" right there on the updated comments on their published paper. Here's what they said: But they make clear that further work will need to be done to confirm or deny that hypothesis. That will need to be done by watching for the same signals on different equipment so that all other explanations can be discarded. Again, NOBODY SAID UNEQUIVOCALLY. I hate it when people do that. This is why I always ask people to quote me where I said this or that because when people can't debate the evidence they try to debate against things that were never said. They also said this: ALL natural explanations need to be exhausted BEFORE Extraterrestrials are invoked as a possible explanation. WHAT!!! That makes no sense. This standard would make it almost impossible to find an Extraterrestrial signal. In most cases ALL natural explanations will never be exhausted so we will have to talk about these things in terms of probability and what's most likely and least likely at least at first. Look, it's easy to cherry pick after the fact. Like I said, an earlier study about the search for Extraterrestrials PREDICTED that we would see these signals and that would be evidence to support the hypothesis. That's just Science. If you look at the sentence, it says BEFORE you can even invoke Extraterrestrials as a possible explanation. Again, that's absurd. Extraterrestrial existence needs to be looked at as a possible explanation based on the observed evidence not an extraordinary claim. edit on 26-10-2016 by neoholographic because: (no reason given)",1
We Know The Truth,"link Hey People: I always enjoy your threads, though I think you focus too much on a singular belief issue or pattern, and then it becomes self affirming for you in your research. First, this: But voices actual voices in your head is always mental illness. Sorry, maybe a stress reaction, not to be judgmental, happens to the best and such, just really not what I am trying to convey here. Though I believe you are quite intelligent, I don't think you are qualified, exactly, to make that wholesale, definitive judgement. You even contradict that by referencing Dr. Vinod's ""channeling"" of the Nine in 1952. Channeling, by definition, (from Dictionary.com) means in one sense: the practice of professedly entering a meditative or trancelike state in order to convey messages from a spiritual guide. Surely this process would involve the sensory structure of hearing. I don't wish to debate voice to skull tech with you because I don't sense this is really what your thread is about. But there have been lawsuits waged and won over such technology being used to harass people, who don't test as schizophrenic or any other DSM related diagnosis that would explain auditory hallucinations, indicating mental illness.

Kucinich introduced in the American Congress a bill, obliging the American president to get engaged in the negotiations aimed at the ban of space based weapons. In this bill the definition of a weapon system includes: any other unacknowledged or as yet undeveloped means inflicting death or injury on, or damaging or destroying, a person (or the biological life, bodily health, mental health, or physical and economic well-being of a person) through the use of land-based, sea-based, or space-based systems using radiation, electromagnetic, psychotronic, sonic, laser, or other energies directed at individual persons or targeted populations or the purpose of information war, mood management, or mind control of such persons or populations"" (12). As in all legislative acts quoted in this article the bill counts with sound, light or electromagnetic stimulation of human brain. Psychotronic weapons remain, at least for a layman uninformed of secret military research, in the sphere of science fiction, since so far none of the published scientific experiments was presented in the way which would allow for its replication. That it is feasible to manipulate human behavior with the use of subliminal, either sound or visual, messages is now generally known. This is why in most of the countries the use of such technologies, without consent of the user, is banned. Devices using light for the stimulation of the brain show another way how the light flashing in certain frequencies could be used for the manipulation of human psychic life. As for the sound, a report on the device transmitting a beam of sound waves, which can hear only persons at whom the beam of sound waves is targeted, appeared last year in the world newspapers. The beam is formed by a combination of sound and ultrasound waves which causes that a person targeted by this beam hears the sound inside of his head. Such a perception could easily convince the human being that it is mentally ill. The acts presented in this article suggest that with the development of technology and knowledge of the functioning of human brain new ways of manipulation of human mind keep emerging. One of them seems to be the electromagnetic energy. Though in the open scientific literature only some 30 experiments were published, supporting this assumption (1),(2), already in 1974, in the USSR, after successful testing with military unit in Novosibirsk, the installation Radioson (Radiosleep) was registered with the Government Committee on the Matters of Inventions and Discoveries of the USSR, described as a method of induction of sleep by means of radio waves (3), (4), (5)‚Ä¶ 22. Dear Senator-Attorney Letter included: We seek your office‚Äôs assistance in initiating hearings and a fact-finding congressional inquiry into the government agencies and/or private companies that are targeting citizens. Many citizens are desperate to be freed from the disturbing, intrusive and oppressive targeting. Evidence supports the conclusion that weapons exist that could be used against individuals, based on U.S. Patent and Trademark Office filings, public releases by agencies, and other technologies that indicate the level of technological sophistication. The weapons are believed to be based on electromagnetism, microwaves, sonic waves, lasers and other types of directed energy, and were characterized as ‚Äúpsychotronic‚Äù in Rep. Dennis Kucinich‚Äôs draft of House Resolution 2977, the Space Preservation Act of 2001. Furthermore, it is undeniable that government agencies have tested citizens without permission in the past; for example, the CIA‚Äôs human experimentation discussed in Orlikow v. U.S., 682 F.Supp. 77 (D.D.C. 1988), secretly administered lysergic acid diethylamide discussed in United States v. Stanley, 483 U.S. 669 (1987), and military chemical experimentation as discussed in Congressional Committee Report 103-97, 103d Congress, 2d Session, S. Prt. 103-97 (Dec. 8, 1994). Lastly, the sheer numbers of people complaining of being targeted, including people with post-graduate degrees and a lifetime of achievements, and the similarities in symptoms tend to outweigh a dismissive response based on charges of anecdotal evidence or group paranoia. there is a certain risk of sounding too conspiratorial, however, common denominators such as physical symptoms and medical reports, surveillance scenarios, harassment techniques, and more can be readily established. I highly recommend reading in full the details of this lawsuit, containing a great deal of verifiable information. The military has admitted for some time to having, at the least, a non lethal (lol) weapon called active denial. But this rabbit hole goes much, much deeper. Having said all that, as I've said before in one of your threads, I think it wise to consider that it's not just one thing or another. It's many things. There could be aliens, for instance. And then there could be MILABS, leaving the person with the memory of an alien abduction, rather than their being used for human experimentation, which is supposed to be against our constitution, and most certainly against our human rights. And then people can also suffer from temporal lobe, seizure like hallucinations, but one must also remember that these can most certainly be induced, artificially, as well. In short, I think your rabbit hole is only making it to the gopher level regards,",1
UFO over the East Valley here in AZ last night.,UFO over the East Valley here in AZ last night. page: 1 link I couldn't take any pictures I live in West Mesa and the lights were way East. Over Queen Creek area. Lots of my friends and family started calling me right when the lights started happening so I went out to my balcony and there they were. Some people got some pretty good videos. I know some people will say they are flares from a plane but if they are flares why do they dispensary right away. Typically if its a flare it will stay ignited for a short period of time. Kinda nuts. I only witnessed the later 3 lights when it was dark out. It was pretty cool to see and stopped soon after it started. What does ATS think??? edit on 26-10-2016 by PraetorianAZ because: (no reason given),1
Found this nugget in Podesta files Fastwalkers and DSP Program,"Found this nugget in Podesta files Fastwalkers and DSP Program page: 1 Found this in the Podesta files, ID # 30433. It's probably well known already, just thought I'd post it just in case. Podesta had forwarded this letter he received onto Leslie Kean. Date: 2015-03-06 John ‚Äì Just tuck this in your UFO files for future reference. One of the government programs that collects hard data on unidentified flying objects is the USAF DSP satellite program. I can add a little insight to rumors published on the web. While I was never fully briefed into the DSP operation directly, I was introduced to them as the US prepared for Operation Desert Shield and Desert Storm. On occasion, I had lunch with a few of them in the cafeteria of a highly classified organization in El Segundo, CA. No one could get into the cafeteria without TS/SCI clearances, so this was not ‚Äúlightweight group of gossipers.‚Äù One of these times, a member of that group was really excited ‚Äì said they‚Äôd just picked up Fastwalker (I assumed that same day). He described how it entered our atmosphere from ‚Äúdeep space‚Äù (origin actually unknown, of course, but from the backside of the satellite) and zipped by the DSP satellite pretty closely on its way to earth. Not only was it going very fast but it made a 30 degree course correction (turn) which means it did not have a ballistic (free fall) reentry trajectory that a meteorite might have. So, it was under some sort of control ‚Äì although whether it was ‚Äúmanned‚Äù or just ‚Äúrobotic‚Äù there‚Äôs no way to tell. Although its now 24 years later, one factoid makes me think the USAF is still collecting information on these Fastwalkers. Reading the current official USAF ‚ÄúDSP Fact Sheet‚Äù there is this line near the end: In addition, researchers at The Aerospace Corporation have used DSP to develop portions of a hazard support system that will aid public safety in the future. www.losangeles.af.mil... Also, much of the information on this site is accurate although I do not know the author or his sources: ufodigest.com... Somewhere within that USAF program office is many year‚Äôs worth of Fastwalker data. If someone were to collect and analyze it, patterns will emerge that provide information about the various types of craft and their destinations, which would add substantiation to eyewitness claims on the ground about UFO activity. Furthermore, it would be interesting to understand the dates of these appearances ‚Äì is there a certain time of the every year they swarm in (which might indicate a resource mining operation) or might there be a correlation with major events on earth, (such as the detonation of the first atomic bomb at White Sands in 1945 although no DSP‚Äôs existed to provide any info on that particular event)?

Gov. Bill Weld Encourges Supporters to Stop Trump,"Gov. Bill Weld Encourges Supporters to Stop Trump page: 1 Statement by Gov. Bill Weld This is basically a backwards endorsement of Hillary. ‚ÄúAgainst that backdrop, I would like to address myself to all those in the electorate who remain torn between two so-called major party candidates whom they cannot enthusiastically support. I‚Äôm speaking particularly to those Republicans who feel that our President should exhibit commonly accepted standards of decency and discipline. *snip ‚ÄúAfter careful observation and reflection, I have come to believe that Donald Trump, if elected President of the United States, would not be able to stand up to this pressure and this criticism without becoming unhinged and unable to perform competently the duties of his office. I wonder what effect this will have on Libertarian Party members if any. I think it's unfortunate that people are feeling forced to support Hillary in order to stop Trump. Trump supporters need to take a long hard look in the mirror and realize that such a repulsive person, a man some voted for just for the lulz has ensured a Clinton presidency.

Little Blue Balls...,"link Years ago I came here for the UFOs and after a small amount of time I stopped believing, mostly due to nothing being 'real' anymore, most stuff is faked, at least in my opinion... The below is true, even if it's not as exciting as CGI videos... My main reason for posting is about one of the (very few) times I saw 'stuff'. Back in Summer of July,1974 I went on a camping trip to Possum Kingdom Lake in West Texas with a friend Robert, (my last trip as a single guy before I got married the following month). The trip was a lot of canoeing, swimming, cliff diving, snorkeling, and camping out at night beneath the stars, no tent, just star gazing while we eventually drifted off to sleep nightly. (Robert and I were best friends and also worked together too) Anyway, one really, REALLY dark chilly and moonless night about 9:30pm or so, we had tucked ourselves in our sleeping bags and had a really good spot (elevated with no distractions) to look at the night sky, I had excellent vision then and could see pretty danged good, (I was 21) my friend was 20. He partook of the herb and drank beer daily and I consumed a few beers daily, by nightfall we were tuckered out and wanted nothing more than to just go to sleep, the heat of the West Texas day really took it out of us. The campsite was only accessed by boat, we used a rental canoe, so we paddled our way to this place that was a fairly large and very rugged rocky peninsula with some cliffs being 20-30 foot high. (They seemed a LOT taller to me!) We camped on the top of the cliffs at night and played down on the water by day. So this one night I was looking at a particular spot up there above us and he was looking at another, I then saw, it, and said, ""Look right there!"", he having binoculars he looked at where I had pointed, saw ""it"" and got pretty excited. He finally let me look at it through his binoculars and what I saw was the following... Slightly larger than what we normally see a satellite was a transparent, or semi-transparent and faint bluish looking sphere, a clear 'bubble really, moving at a speed I remember as being slightly faster than what a satellite would be going, but not so much faster or slower than any plane/jet traffic would be, in my estimation. It was going South and we watched it by passing the binoculars back and forth. We both assumed it was a satellite. Exciting stuff, but then one of us (I really can't remember who) noticed another one, this time coming from the East, they appeared to be on a course that appeared to us that would be really a close call if they were at the same altitude. When they were getting a little too close for comfort (at least for us!) the one that came from the East shot a light bluish light at the Southbound sphere, it wasn't laser-like at all (I don't think) but it appeared more like a v-shaped beam from a flashlight shot at it. It lasted all of a second, and I am positive that it happened due to we both saw it at the same time. The light flash made the Southbound one turn Westward, now going almost the same direction as the one from the East, making them both going in the same direction, actually the one that got flashed didn't make a 90 degree turn, it was really going more of a path more like West-southwest more like 87 degrees or so, just guessing now. When I say that it turned, it turned abruptly, not at all anything like any plane would do, that struck us both as being odd, no curving involved at all. We watched them until they both grew dim from the distance, both staying in a straight line to their (intended?) destination. Of course we kept thinking that the one that flashed the beam would turn and follow the other, but nope. I could be wrong on the speed and the directions, but the rest is completely accurate. The really sharp turn back then was unheard of, we hear it all of the time now, years ago though it wasn't talked about at all, not even in the tabloids. This is why this really stood out out to me all of these years, that almost 90 degree turn. To be honest I just didn't understand what we had just seen. We finally got to sleep that night, I don't know how long it took us, but we did, but after a few hours (around 3-ish am) Robert woke me up and said, ""Listen!"", and I heard footsteps, that scared us pretty good 'cause we had gotten so worked up earlier, I guess. heheh We listened to the small branches and small gravel rocks moving beneath whatever it was that was about to kill us, well, we did until we finally scared ourselves to sleep. (I have to admit, O.K., yeah, I did partake myself, but only a little bit, I wasn't into it like him but I was on vacation, that made us both VERY paranoid, I guess) Anyway, the next morning we found our bread and peanut butter missing, the bread's plastic wrapper was there but no bread. CREEPY. A few years later my boss (who I had told all of this to and he made fun of me) told me that the same thing happened to him, his peanut butter and bread went missing while camped on a river, they determined that it was a raccoon, which, they do this sort of thing, I know now. Now to regular people that might not seem like much, especially now days, here on this forum more spectacular claims are made daily. Still, for back then it was REALLY something. My older brother (by 3-1/2 years) and I were camping with no tent underneath the starry sky of Caddo Lake in East Texas around 1981 in the Spring, May I think, and we were looking at a patch of sky surrounded by silhouetted trees actually talking about when we were kids looking for flying saucers. (That's all they were known as back then) Our entire family would look out at the sky in our backyard, it was a common thing for us to do back in the fifties, after all, that was its heyday. As we stared at the sky in the back of my pick-up I mentioned the bluish sphere that I had seen years before at Possum Kingdom Lake, he being quiet through the entire story, he wasn't that talkative really, and within 5 minutes of me mentioning this to him we saw one. (I had my own binoculars this time!) I was really amazed, it was exactly as what I had seen before, I mean exactly! Nothing major happened though, it just quietly slid across the sky in front of us and disappeared behind the trees to our right, and that was that. My brother was never a believer anyway, maybe had it landed it would change his mind. We saw several regular ol' satellites afterwards too. Why I even bring this up is that when I first started coming here around 2008 (lurking) I read a thread of a guy here that saw the exact thing I did, with the slightly v-shaped flashlight looking beam and the other blue sphere turning away, I'd REALLY love to read that again, it was a good feeling to be somewhat confirmed. I say, ""confirmed"" because that friend, Robert that witnessed the sphere denied it in front of a LOT of people at work. We hardly talked about anything else on that trip, and especially on the way home too. Assuming he felt as I did I brought it up when a bunch of guys were taking a break at work, maybe 10-12 people, I didn't see the harm in telling what we saw. After I said my piece I said, ""Ask Robert"". Robert said I was crazy and he didn't see a thing, I thought he was kidding but he was being serious, you'd think that on the way back he'd say that he wasn't wanting to tell anyone, but, Nooo... edit on 26-10-2016 by recrisp because: Typo",1

Russia puzzled by Norways decision to host US Marines,"Russia 'puzzled' by Norway's decision to host US Marines page: 1 link Norway is to break a decades-old commitment not to host foreign troops on its soil by accommodating 330 US Marines next year. Russia, the apparent target of the buildup, said it was puzzled by the move. The Marines will be stationed at the Vaernes military base in central Norway from January, the Norwegian Defense Ministry said in a statement on Monday. The agreement for the deployment will be reviewed in the course of the year, it added. SOURCE I was one of the few posters on this forum who expressed that Norway's decision to have Marines deployed on its home soil was significant. Part of the reason I believe it is significant is Russia's reaction to the move. Our opinions mean nothing in this matter. If Russia considers the move to be significant then it's significant. I wonder if posters will be able to put aside their egos for this thread and not focus on their view of this issue but focus on Russia's view. Quoting from the article linked above: ""The deployment appears to be in line with NATO's strategy to boost its military presence close to Russia‚Äôs borders. The alliance decided to send four 1,000-strong battalions each to Poland and the Baltic states, claiming it was needed to deter Russia.""

His blood is clumping up and they found crystals that seem engineered in the blood using an electron microscope. then today i read this.. remote influencing.. As we all know all electronic circuits need power, in the case of Remote Influencing Psychotronic Generators provide this power. Tim Rifat has developed the Psychotronic Generator from simple Pavlita generators to the far future Bone Generators(TM) using your own skull and bones as Psychotronic Crystal Generators. These Bone Generators(TM) change the Quantum Wave Function of reality, Remote Influencing. The science of Remote Influencing is based on quantum mechanics only Tim Rifat has developed science to explain Remote Influencing. The process is to decohere the Quantum Wave Function, decollapse it and return it to it's quantum vacuum grand state, modify the Quantum Wave Function to the remote influenced event, collapse it using hyperinfinity so it manifests as your remote influenced event. (see www.supernaturalspirit.com Services for full explanation). In effect we zap the thing to be changed make it vanish and remanifest it as the event we went in laymans language; this takes energy supplied by Psychotronic Amplifiers in your Psychotronic Bone Generators(TM) as well as hyperinfinity the operator that holds the new event in being supplied by your Bone Generators(TM). Only one event can be carried out at a time (explained on www.psychicpowergambling.com) so Tim Rifat has arranged to quantum mechanically change your skeleton into Bone Psychotronic Generators(TM) for one specific event and give you the energy and Psychotronic Fuel with the hyperinfinity to manifest 12 of these singular events after which your Bone Generators which are acting as Psychotronic Batteries run out of energy. ive experienced temporal effects both physical and mental in being attacked by some kind of possibly similar technology. i have no dount im on a similar program as magnus. i get tortured bad. thats all ill say.",1
Why isnt observer evidence like eyewitness accounts counted as evidence for UFOs?,"Why isn't observer evidence like eyewitness accounts counted as evidence for UFO's? page: 1 link Eyewitness accounts have been used by Science for years. Newton used eyewtiness accounts in the Principia when talking about comets. He came up with a theory on comets based on recorded sighting throughout the world like a boy saw a comet and this is what he described. There wasn't any internet to even verify the credibility of these eyewitness accounts yet Newton used them to come up with a theory about comets which helped lead to his equations of Gravity. So if eyewitness accounts are so unreliable, how did Newton use them to come up with his theories? We also saw this with meteorites. This is from Wiki: Although meteors have been known since ancient times, they were not known to be an astronomical phenomenon until early in the 19th century. Prior to that, they were seen in the West as an atmospheric phenomenon, like lightning, and were not connected with strange stories of rocks falling from the sky. In 1807, Yale University chemistry professor Benjamin Silliman investigated a meteorite that fell in Weston, Connecticut.[27] Silliman believed the meteor had a cosmic origin, but meteors did not attract much attention from astronomers until the spectacular meteor storm of November 1833.[28] People all across the eastern United States saw thousands of meteors, radiating from a single point in the sky. Astute observers noticed that the radiant, as the point is now called, moved with the stars, staying in the constellation Leo.[29] ASTUTE OBSERVERS saw meteors radiating from a single point in the sky and to this day this is still called the radient. I thought Science never uses eyewitness accounts? Also, here's a list of published papers and studies on U.F.O.'s. This page offers a list of 100+ articles, papers and monographs about UFOs / UAPs published in professional journals and specialty publications. Two polls of professional & amateur astronomers respectively, on whether they see UFOs or not. Finally 60+ PhD dissertations and academic publications about UFOs. Very little peer-reviewed literature has been published in which academics have proposed, studied or supported non-prosaic explanations for UFOs. www.hyper.net... Why aren't there more non-prosaic explanations of U.F.O.'s? That alone lends support to the notion that extraterrestrial visitation has occurred. I have had 3 sightings myself. Two looked like probes. It was real windy one day and the wind was almost knocking me over, then this round orb passed in front of me going against the wind. It slowed down and then it sped back up. Where are all the Scientist explaining U.F.O.'s? Why are there still these unidentified objects in the sky? We have aeriel phenomena in the sky that can avoid radar, outrun our best planes and cause nuclear facilities to malfunction. After 60 or more years of these sightings why can't Scientist explain these things like Newton did with comets based on eyewitness accounts or what happened with metorites? Here's 565 eyewitness accounts",1

Mike Pence (R), who has pushed the ‚Äúvoter fraud‚Äù conspiracy on the campaign trail alongside Donald Trump. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôve seen nothing but partisan activity from the secretary of state, and even from the police,‚Äù Buck said. ‚ÄúThey saw that there was a very successful voter registration drive happening, and this was an attempt to shut it down.‚Äù ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs clear that the governor or the governor‚Äôs staff are very aware and involved in what‚Äôs happening,‚Äù he continued. ‚ÄúIt fits into the Trump/Pence narrative that in certain neighborhoods, you have to watch how many times people show up to vote and how things happen.‚Äù If this situation is Not fully clarified in the following hours we could see in the General election how Trump will probably take Indiana with a really small margin of votes by blocking these voters to be able to express their decision freely. All this operation of today is part of carefully designed Republican strategy to use the excuse of a possible fraud to justify arbitrary measures that will prevent many Americans to elect the next President, is a political boycott of the General Election. Please check: theintercept.com... This is an Red Alert to all voters that oppose Donald Trump to watch carefully the behavior and decisions taken by the Republican governors to try to favor their Candidate. ‚ÄúThey saw that there was a very successful voter registration drive happening, and this was an attempt to shut it down.‚Äù Please check: www.dailykos.com... The thread is open not only to discuss this so dark operation but also to invite other members of ATS community to report irregularities of any kind that are right now taking place to assure that on November who become elected will be President not because it has really the support of the majority but because thousands of Americans are going to be deprived of their right to vote. Voter registration drives across the country follow similar protocol, without being subject to investigations. A Huffington Post investigation reported that ‚Äúit seems the extraordinary investigation is likely to find no more than potential technical violations of obscure regulations for third-party voter registration groups.‚Äù Thanks for your attention,",1
Is Donald Trump Autistic?,"link Donald Trump could have a disability that used to be known as Aspergers, and this can cause people trouble when they try to socialize because their theory of mind is not complete. Basically, they have trouble thinking of how others perceive their actions. These people tend to be highly intelligent. Trump's IQ is 156, which makes sense considering he has built more businesses than most of us have, and although he could have invested his father's money and made the same amount back as he did in the end through business deals, he put a lot of work and thought into his business. I would like to know what kind of medicines Trump is on and what his mental health diagnosis are. If he has Aspergers, then that would explain why he makes so many social mistakes. Being super rich from a young age might also account for it since he would not be trained to interact with people on an equal level (which is a lot more complicated than interacting with people when you are rich and they are poor). However, an article in The New York Times recently focused on Trump's fears of making social blunders. He has a fear of losing social status or being embarrassed publicly. However, he doesn't seem to do well publicly, which must be a disability because he would *want* to be a good public speaker and not make social gaffes yet he still does it. It must be accidental. Donald even stated he is a difficult man to be married to, which means he knows himself and his weaknesses. Many people with Aspergers don't get married because they have a hard time in relationships.",1

Not far off the end now... page: 1 Hello ATS I'm subject to a fierce experiment, or, how it feels to me : torture. I'm not an expert on biology or how the brain works in detail, so forgive me if this post is a little simplistic. Basically I've nanobots (which supposedly don't exist) in my brain, an,d (I assume) they act on my brain chemicals in such a way as to cause chronic depression...suicidal depression in fact. To cut to the chase, as you say in the USA, they also electrocute my nerves (ALL AT ONCE), causing agonising pain! The 'bots are remote/radio controlled by the English SS (and they ARE very similar to the Nazi SS in their treatment of me, I think). So basically, I hear voices (The SS again), and am suffering from feelings that I want to die. About my quite happy 'previous life' before this happened : I was just a young lad who e naonwanted career in computer programming and studied Math/Maths to a high standard (my tutor said I was doing the work of a professor), and still lived at home bashing away at my computer to try and achieve my ambition. As a lot of you will know though COMPUTING is a conspiracy theory too (ie it's not all it states it is). So I suppose I'm doubly unlucky. Why they can't just use a monkey, instead of driving me to my death I don't know, I really dont. Anyways, oh I forgot...the nanobots block the action of nearly ALL the psycho-active drugs I've tried liked anti-depressants etc.",1

Master of the Estate,"It seems there isn't going to be a Halloween writing contest, so I thought I would post the story I pre-emptively wrote for it. I hope you enjoy it! Master of the Estate ""This coach really is quite wonderful, Jonathan. I can barely feel the bumps and I don't feel like I'm about to be thrown out the window!"" Eleanor exclaimed. ""It is grand, isn't it?"" ""It's all grand. The trip, our coach...and you,"" she said, smiling and snuggling in closer to Jonathan on the wide leather seat. ""I could do without this fog, though. I would like to see the moon and stars later tonight."" He pulled the curtain aside slightly with a gloved hand and peered mournfully through the window at the white mist that nearly obscured everything. He could hardly see the tops of the trees it was so thick. Just then a particularly large bump jostled them roughly, followed closely by another. ""Oh!"" squealed Eleanor. Jonathan's brow drew down. ""Driver!"" he called out the window. ""Is everything alright?"" ""Beg pardon, sir. I fear I may have taken a wrong turn at that fork back a ways. There's a house up ahead...I'll check in with them and make sure. Sturbridge Village can't be far now, and we're better safe than sorry with this fog rolling in, if you take my meaning, sir. Don't want to be out past dark in this soup."" Jonathan looked at Eleanor. ""Well, it would be nice to stretch our legs for a moment,"" she said. She was not quite as cheerful as she had been just minutes ago. The October afternoon was cooling off as evening approached, and Jonathan could see his breath. The coach trundled past well-maintained stone gables and a heavy wrought-iron gate, standing open on one side. Oil lanterns hung from black hooks in the gables glowed dimly in the fog, and additional lanterns spilled pools of yellow-orange light on a cobblestone drive as they made their way up toward the house. Eleanor gasped as the massive shape of the house came into view. ""It's beautiful!"" Jonathan made a surprised ""hm"", but otherwise said nothing. A well-dressed footman dashed out to lower the stairs of their coach and open the door, then offered a white-gloved hand to Eleanor as she peered out. With a flashed smile at Jonathan, she accepted the young man's hand and descended. The driver was speaking quietly with another footman, and an older man emerged from the heavy oak door of the house as Jonathan descended the steps of the coach. The older man - clearly the butler - bowed to Eleanor and Jonathan. ""Welcome to the Anne Union Keyes Estate. I am Mister Walker, and I am at your service. The master of the estate has invited you in for the evening meal."" The butler spoke with some kind of British accent, but beyond that Jonathan not say from where exactly. ""Good Lord man, we just arrived unannounced!"" ""Yes, sir, but Herr von Graeff enjoys entertaining and was notified of your arrival as you drove up. I would be honored if you would follow me..."" he gestured toward the polished steps. Eleanor was the type of woman who, once her mind was made, up, proceeded without hesitation. She must have decided they were staying for dinner, for with a delighted squeal she headed for the house. They were greeted in the foyer by an elderly man. Jonathan estimated he was in his seventies, hair fully white with deep creases in his face on age showing on his hands. However, the man was tall and straight-backed, and he carried himself proudly. There was a stiffness to his movements, and he used a cane to walk, but when Jonathan shook his large hands the man's grip was as firm as a man half his age. ‚ÄúWelcome,‚Äù he said warmly and with what Jonathan thought was a German accent. ‚ÄúI am Gottfried Hansj√ºrgen von Graeff. Please, be welcome in my home. How may I call you?‚Äù The man‚Äôs eyes were unusual, but Jonathan could not place what it was about them that seemed so. He shrugged it off. ‚ÄúThank you, Herr von Graeff. I am Jonathan Rockport, this is my fianc√©e Eleanor Harrington. We really have only stopped to find our way back to the highway. We are trying to get to Sturbridge Village to stay for the night before continuing on to Fall River in the morning.‚Äù ‚ÄúAh, yes, well, you will not make it to Sturbridge Village in this fog.‚Äù Herr von Graeff pronounced the name of the town with a ‚Äúsh‚Äù sound. ‚ÄúAt least, not before dark, even if you left now. It is fifteen miles yet. Why don‚Äôt you join me for dinner, stay here tonight, and then resume your journey first thing tomorrow?‚Äù ‚ÄúYou are a generous host, Herr von Graeff, but I really would like to press on if possible. I have business meetings in Massachusetts and must be in Fall River by Tuesday. ‚Äù ‚ÄúAh, a wonderful town, Fall River, yes? Tell me, how is the new railway doing? I understand the esteemed Mr. Borden opened the branch line just last year, yes?‚Äù ‚ÄúIndeed,‚Äù said Jonathan slowly, ‚ÄúThe railway has been a smashing success. In fact, it is Mr. Borden I have an appointment to see. I have a business proposition for him that I think he will be quite excited about.‚Äù ‚ÄúAn entrepreneur!‚Äù Exclaimed Herr von Graeff. ‚ÄúExcellent! I always enjoy conversing with a businessman, especially you Americans. Always such big ideas, yes? Please, let us carry on our conversation over dinner. Mister Walker,‚Äù he continued, pronouncing the butler‚Äôs name with a ‚Äúv‚Äù, ‚Äúwould you lead us to the dining hall?‚Äù ‚ÄúYes, Herr von Graeff.‚Äù",1

Trump promised something that NO DEMOCRAT has cared enough to attempt, in decades. Our next President proposed and detailed a critically important ""NEW DEAL FOR BLACK AMERICA"". Story: www.nbcnews.com... It's a damn shame that Barack Hussein Obama completely ignored the/his Black community after receiving their votes. Now, Hillary Clinton is following in his footsteps.. She's blindly assuming that because she's a Democrat, and was endorsed by Barack Obama, the African American community will ""fall in line"" like good little mindless minions, and cast their 16 million votes for her, like they did for Obama in 2012. This cycle, open-minded Black Americans who refuse to be FOOLED AGAIN, are indeed going to give Donald Trump a try.

Don King Introduces Donald Trump (C-Span Video): www.youtube.com... For obvious reasons, the ""old guard"" community leaders like Jesse Jackson, Al Sharpton, along with the NAACP, are not in Donald Trump's corner. But what's most telling, is that they are not out there at rallies raising Hillary's arm to roaring crowds of supporters either. Probably because they know Hillary is lying when she exclaims, ""I ain't in no ways ever tired of fightin for youuu!"" in Black churches.

Our heaven is dependency on technology! This is Teotihuacan People were inspired to build such large and grandiose structures and attribute them to the Sun and the Moon. But why obviously the sun being a life giver is something to honor. But the Moon is a great question. Night is the absence of the Sun and everything depending on the Sun surely would not want to celebrate it's absence. It must be because the Sun was attributed to a great king who sailed across a mighty ocean much like the sun does the sky. And the moon was attributed to a great queen that did the same. And both of them must have proven with great detail. That not only made you believe past all the great technology they brought with them but also believing in them with your heart and soul. That kind of belief transcends time and it also transcends race and species. Those people knew that the moon was not real proof of this is that they symbolize the moon with the crescent moon. If you pay attention at all the moon like god and everything else on the planet snitches what the truth is no matter how good it is at hiding it. And the crescent moon is a snitch that it can cloak and uncloak. Otherwise why would anyone attribute the night with the moon. You would just mark tiny dots in a sky and point to the day and say absent of the sun. It means that while we are very technologically dependent we are being told to believe through what is natural and what mother nature has intended you to see. Why advancement is necessary it's also good to stay rooted and see that everything from top to bottom no matter how primitive still believes in the same Sun and Moon that all life depend on.

Vote for who you would, even if it takes a few hours. I've seen quite a bit of conversation of folks not wanting to vote at all. What does this prove? What is this standing (sitting) against? Your disapproval of the two party system or maybe you think the whole thing a charade? My opinion would leave me to believe that if your going to attempt to rebel against the system it would be a secure third party vote or a vote for the future so to speak. We as Americans need to take back our power over Government. There is more than just the Presidency at stake and to me I would think that not voting at all is a contribution to the apathy that has us in the situation we are in. Whether it be Trump or Drumf or Hillary or Shillary or Stein or Johnson or Joe Blow, I would urge you to vote! If you are not voting at all, would you please elaborate as to why? I'm trying to imagine the next president of the USA being Joe Blow. Well now President Blow, what do you think of the Cannabis trade with Mexico? Anything to declare?",1

Female Reporter: I see, so that they don't turn out. Benton: Yeah just keep them ‚Äî just try to drop her turn out two or three points Basically if they put out enough negative adds about how she hasn't supported blacks and there causes they will make it less likely they will vote for her.

UFO Investigator - MAX SPIERS - Found Dead After Vomiting Black Liquid.,"link a reply to: carewemust ""Vomiting black liquid"" caught my eye. I know bleeding internally can cause black vomit, sometimes it looks like coffee grounds. But something in the HeatStreet article that Fox news linked too also caught my eye: Max was buried in Canterbury cemetery after his mother arranged to have his body flown home a week after his death. A post-mortem examination was carried out by a pathologist in east Kent, but Vanessa says that more than two months later she still does not know the result, or whether there will be an inquest. She added: ‚ÄúApparently, he had not suffered any obvious physical injuries but he could have been slowly poisoned, which is why the results of toxicology tests from his post-mortem are so important. [bolding by me] Activated charcoal -- which is black and readily available to anyone -- is used to treat poisoning, and could cause black vomit also. Could Spiers have suspected he was being poisoned and tried to self-treat with activated charcoal? I can't find much more about the black vomit... as in if someone was with him before/during/after he vomited the black liquid... or if it was found at the same time as he was found dead.",1

A guide to the Paradoxroutine,"A guide to the Paradoxroutine page: 1 Hah I'm here randomly post, and be good at nothing. If I were to sum up myself in one form or another it would be this: What is it that I wish to create? In a seamless dance of hope and intrigue, I jitter and pounce on that which does define. But in an ends' motion what is it that I have made? More musing of a solid soul, a gasp of an angel brought forth upon the devils mask. Shattered within a hopeless contextual void of self dissolution. To dissolve in ones own thoughts of regard of high and mighty being? In the beginning what is it that we seek? In hell and high water, in times of disregard. What is it that seeks us. From times of happenstance to those of remorse. Again we beckon the call to purpose and resolve. Every time, even without a moments clarity we call too and forth of the void, to give us direction. Show me ways beyond vice, ways not wanted of founded living, shallower within such a world. Should they be down caste or sought without voice? Give me guidance before the light. Hope before the void. I shall know of the kingship of a heralds' life, before the life of a herald be know to his people. To this preponderance I shadow skirt my minds eye, to a veil beyond the guise that which is a worded Maya. I find such things a mere hope of sound falling. Give me hope or the hope of death. Give me light or knowledge of only darkness. Give not guidance, but a misadventured fall into the abysmal realm of chance and near do wells shortcomings. Shall be you chance or stones carved Providence? I beckon the call to truth, yet I hope and pray tell that none does exist. The only way to continue searching, is to never find the answer we seek. To find is to know, to know is to be content. To be content is to stagnant in truth. To find death in one truth, one truth among many. To live is to know nothing, but to know what you understand has already become false by nature is to understand that my musings are bull****. edit on 10|27|2016 by Paradoxroutine because: Because I'm a dumbass.",1

Looking Beyond November 8th - A Song of Oligarchy and Doom,"link Hello again ATS! Though we are two weeks out from Election Day as I sit to write these words ‚Äì I find myself already looking beyond Tuesday, November the eighth and at some of the things that I think will happen between now and 2020 as well as what I think the landscape will look like in the year leading up to that year's election. It won't be a popular opinion here on ATS, I am sure... But as of today I feel confident in saying that, short of some unprecedented and wholly unforseeable revelation or event ‚Äì this years election is very likely a done deal. Hillary Clinton will almost certainly be the next President of the United States. With just two weeks remaining before Election Day ( as of this writing ), the meta-analysis of polls shows Clinton possessing nearly an insurmountable lead. While it is true that Trump enjoys a very passionate and enthusiastic base, he has done little to successfully expand that base. The potential for him to find a means of connecting with undecided and uncommitted voters is minimal and shrinks with each passing day. Having come to this view, I find myself free to look beyond the coming weeks and to try and get a handle on what a post 2016 world will look like. Frankly, gazing into my allegorical crystal ball, I see dark and threatening clouds gathering on our horizon. Clouds that could very well bring a storm of epic proportions our way. Election Night Blues The night of Tuesday, November the eighth could well be historic ‚Äì in the worst of ways. This election cycle has broken several taboos and lowered the bar of political discourse in unprecedented ways. It has been a season of highly divisive hyperbole and rhetoric that has built-up a great deal of social tension. We currently sit atop a very, very dry powder keg of anger that is seething and highly volatile. Passions will be flaring among many as we watch the Election results stream in on our televisions, computers and phones. Many of those watching will be deeply, deeply emotionally invested in the outcome of this race. In this climactic moment we, as a nation, will be perilously close to critical mass. One spark away from potential disaster... Four years ago a man with some degree of fame was emotionally invested in that years election and he took to social media, Twitter, to vent his reactions in a paroxysmal spasm of emotion... That minor celebrity was one Donald J. Trump: Source Imagine for a moment what could happen if history repeats itself and this same man goes on a similar rant this Election night. Imagine the violence such a display could potentially trigger. Then stop imagining and take a deep breath... Such a reaction is not just possible ‚Äì given the evidence, it is more than likely the probable outcome. Trump is currently heavily invested in telling his followers that the election is rigged, that they have no voice and that he is ""the only one"" who can save them. This is a very, very dangerous and unstable bit of social chemistry. Most Trump supporters, obviously, will not lash out in violence if their candidate loses the race ‚Äì even if they personally feel that the outcome of the Election was not legitimate. However some Trump supporters, those in the extremes of what the media is currently calling ""the alt right"" very well could take to the streets in rage. Given some of the fringe support that Trump enjoys, I would honestly be surprised if such things were not already being planned by a handful of those on the fringe. The rhetoric of revolution has been abused of late ‚Äì and there are always the few who take such statements far too literally... Across the line. Blunty put ‚Äì if Election night comes and Trump loses ‚Äì and if he takes to Twitter as he did four years ago ‚Äì it could well result in a very long and bloody night. A catastrophic night that we will look back upon with shame. A night that could well poison our nation for years to come. Much Ado About Trump TV Many pundits and wonks have mused over the fact that it truly does appear that Trump has been laying the groundwork for a future media operation... Presumably a news network or service of some kind. I count myself among those who have been suggesting so for a fairly long time. However where I differ is that I don't see it as being quite so cut and dry any longer. While I do think that Trump's original thoughts ( or more the thoughts of those who influence Trump ) was to create a new media Conservative news venue... I think that it's now grown into something more. I think that Trump TV ( Or whatever they end up calling it - ""Trump TV"" is too generic. There's no inherent propaganda value in the name. I think something more like ""Trump's MAGA Network"" is probably more on point. ) will be used as a device to begin a new political party. More accurately to succeed where others have previously failed ( I‚Äôm looking at you Sarah Palin and Glenn Beck ) by congealing the various ""Patriot"", ""Tea Party"" and fringe right wing groups into one collective and singular entity ‚Äì a party firmly rooted in extreme nationalism with enough religion and conservatism thrown in to gain wider appeal. My prediction is that Donald Trump will remain the focal point and figurehead of this coming movement ‚Äì using this new network much as he currently utilizes his Twitter feed... A platform for him to vent his late night frustrations, angers and insecurities. His name will be predominantly used in the branding and messaging and Trump will be the face of it all. The most frequent speaker and guest. Imagine if The Apprentice had been a 24/7/365 live streaming show ‚Äì and Trump had the power to walk in at any moment to say whatever happened to be on his mind... That is how I see Trump TV. However I don't see Trump being the driving force behind the actual message. Trump is a brand, after all. He has made his place in this world by putting his name on buildings he didn't build, shows that he didn't create and ideas he didn't originate. Trump works as a spokesperson ‚Äì the guy who says ""I‚Äôm not only the President of... But I'm also a member"". The real people behind the curtain will be The Mercers ( Robert and Rebekah ), Steve Bannon and, to a lesser degree, Roger Ailes. As for on camera talents? I think the current obvious potential faces of this new media enterprise will be Hannity, O'Reilly and Lahren ‚Äì though I'm honestly not personally sure if O'Reilly will make the jump. Money is money, after all, and Big Daddy Bill is sitting pretty comfortably atop the Fox news heap as his career winds down. Regardless, however, of who wins the backstage power war ( Other than the Mercers who are a lock ) and the on camera positions... The network itself will be the propaganda arm of the extreme right wing and I think it very well could end up pulling the national discourse much further to the right in the coming 4-8 years. Particularly with the subjects of national isolationism and national identity politics.",1

A Pilots Experience,"link Greetings ATS community, I wanted to pass on something my dad experienced several years ago in the hopes that perhaps others have experienced something similiar or know someone who has. I found the story quite interesting, and I hope you will too. Background: My dad was a pilot with 30+ years of experience flying all manner of civilian, military, and commercial aircraft. He was a naturally humble and quiet individual--never given to boasting or exageration. Like many pilots, he was wired to be logical, mathematical, and mechanical; he was also a supreme skeptic where all things supernatural and speculative are concerned. He preferred direct experience and scientific inquiry to wild tales. His story: One day he came back from a trip he flew (commercial flight) to Mexico. Over a beer, I casually asked him about his trip. He looked at me, cocked one eyebrow and replied, ""I saw something I can't explain."" This got my attention. On the layover, he and another pilot went out for dinner. Walking back along the beach at night, they both noticed a distant light moving along a fixed vector at a constant speed. They kept watching it, and were wondering about distance and elevation, thinking perhaps it was either a satellite or a high-flying aircraft--nothing out of the ordinary. Then it came to a complete stop, reversed direction 180 degrees, and whizzed off so fast it was out of sight in less than a second or two. So my first response was, ""Do you think it was a UFO?"" Again with the cocked eyebrow he said, ""I don't want to use that word. All I will say is that what we witnessed completely and utterly defies all laws of aerodynamics that I'm familiar with. I'm not aware of any aircraft--military or otherwise--that can do that. It's beyond my abilities to explain; that's all I'm willing to say."" To contrast this story, I will also say that one time we were watching a campy, early 80's Fox program that was reporting on the US government harboring aliens. At one point in the story, they started talking about a particular installation in the mountains of Nevada (not area 51) that's being used as a landing zone for UFO's. Dad started laughing so hard I thought he was going to fall off the couch. He looked at me and said, ""I know what they do there."" I said, ""And???"" He replied, ""I can't tell you that, but I CAN tell you they're NOT landing UFO's."" Total buzz kill. Anyway, that's the story I wanted to relate in the hopes that others can add their own. Thanks for reading.",1
The Moon that Fell from Heaven,"The Moon that Fell from Heaven page: 1 link There is an intriguing text from Anatolian myth with regards to the Moon falling from Heaven; The Moon God fell from the sky and fell upon the gate complex, but no one saw him. The Storm God sent rain after him; he sent rains after him. Fear seized him; anxiety seized him. The god Hapantali went there. He stood beside him and uttered over him the words of a spell. The goddess Kamrusepa looked down from the sky and said: ""What in the world has happened here? A good question from Kamrusepa there then, but the text is fragmentary and partial and the matter isn't really explained, so anyway the first question then is were was this gate complex and why couldn't he, the Moon, be seen having landed. My consideration is that the gate complex is that of the Cilician Gates , and that the Moon can no longer be seen as he has infused the Taurus Mountains with Silver. That region did relate to the Silver Mountains as several sources mention and was a major centre for the trade in Silver at Kultepe/Kanes; The essence of the trade was to ship tin, woolen textiles and lapis lazuli to Anatolia to sell it there in order to acquire, directly or indirectly, silver and gold, which was shipped back to Assur. Tin, essential for the Anatoian production of bronze was imported in Assur from Susa, perhaps by Elamite caravans, and ultimately originated from Central Asia. Assyrian trade colony at Kanes There are a great many tablets related to this trade recovered from Kultepe, on these sometimes can be seen the Taurus bull that bears upon it's back the Silver Mountain. Also seen beneath on that example is the Scorpion which was likely also an ideogram based upon the Cilician gates and greater region, also the symbol of Ishara the Goddess of the Silver Mountain and related to concept idea of the Moon within the Underworld, her symbolic metal silver and purity through refinement, the Temple of Ishara being at Kanes or Nesi to the Hurrians. There were a great many ideas bound up within this symbolism then, including in Cosmological terms the entrance into the underworld being above Taurus in Gemini, and it's opposite point of emergence in Scorpio, according to the inter-section point of the Galactic and Ecliptic planes. Were this gets interesting is that there is a Hurrian myth that relates to a conflict in the primeval period named The Song of Silver involving their tutelary God Tessub and his ongoing issues with Kumarbi, God of Destiny; Among Tessub, the Sun God of the Sky, Sauska Nineveh's Queen, and all the gods, no one worships him, although his power is greater than their power. His word is greater than their words, his wisdom is greater than their wisdom, his battle and his g1ory are greater than theirs. It is Silver the Fine of whom I sing. Wise men to1d me the story of the fatherless boy. It did not exist. Long ago Silver's Father had disappeared. And they do not know his sp1endor. Heroic men ran to battle. Abundance did not exist. And grain did not grow only hunger The Songs of the Kumarbi cycle can contain veiled allegory regarding ethnic disputes such as i outlined here with regards to Byblos and Ebla, it is likely the same in this case, conflict with the region of Nesa and the Silver Mountains, this however relating to a much earlier period, potentially also this relates to conflict from the Heavens as Silver could be named Kubbabar-Anzu as noted here the association with Anzu in conflict with Tessub relating to the same with Ninurta in the Sumerian mythos, and that seemingly from Anatolia. The identification of Silver as DUMU also correlates with the Sumerian notion of the Divine child as Damu, often seen as the basis for the cult of Dumuzid, were it was also the case that the City of Dumuzid, Bad-Tivira, was the centre of the Sumerian metallurgy industry. Silver is described in this text as a wannumiyas DUMU, which means a child whose father is dead or missing. Hittitologists generally translate this as ""orphan,"" Silver's consternation at being told by the orphan boy that he too was an orphan need not mean that he was discovering this for the first time. The Song of Silver again is fragmentary but does seem to involve Silver at some point establishing his power; Silver seized power with his hands. Silver seized the spear. He dragged the Sun and Moon down from heaven. The Sun and the Moon did reverence. They bowed to Silver. The Sun and the Moon began to speak to Silver: O Silver, our lord, do not strike/kill us! We are the luminaries of heaven and earth. We are the torches of what lands you govern. If you strike/kill us, you will proceed to govern the dark lands person-ally."" His soul within him was filled with love.He had pity on them In dragging the Sun and the Moon down from Heaven again it could be considered that is what had infused the Mountains with Gold and Silver, but also it could relate to the establishment of the cults of Allani and Ishara at the time of silver, the spiritual qualities brought down to Earth. Hopefully in the future more complete accounts of these texts will emerge as they are most intriguing and almost completely overlooked apart from specialists in the field, which is a pity as they are more interesting than most. edit on Kam1031300vAmerica/ChicagoThursday2731 by Kantzveldt because: (no reason given)",1
"The Mandela Effect was made by one overlooked 33 year old man, an ascended master (video and proof)","link There is simply no more denying, for millions of people across whatever planet we are actually on now, that the Mandela Effect is the greatest and most important single event in the history of all mankind on every possible level. That's not in question anymore, the only remaining question left is ""Who done it?"". Will the real one responsible for this, please stand up? Now, because this is the biggest display of sheer Power, there are a lot of government agencies whose only job is to make you think that they have power who are sitting down and yelling ""we did it, we are the ones and we did it with our collider!"" And there's others sitting down and yelling ""we did it, with our d computers!"" These collider and d computers are jokes, they can't do anything, you can barely play pacman on them - they are just impressive looking things to you which make you scared of the people who want to control you. That's all they are. You people need to stop being scared of your bullies. Your bully who took you lunch money every day in the 2nd grade - is not the same person who caused a universal-earth-ending-space-time-continuum-Shift. This is real power. Whoever can do this, isn't the same bully who took your lunch money in the 2nd grade. Your government and Nasa and Cern are all a bunch of bullies, who throw water bottles at your head then when you turn around they point to the person next to them and call them a terrorist. That's all they have done throughout the years. But whoever did the Mandela Effect is entirely different from them, whoever did that has True and Real Light. I'll just go ahead and flatly state it for the whole world to hear - I, Pyron, created the Mandela Effect through metaphysical sciences through writing. No computers no colliders, only my mind and heart. It was my true desire to create a new world where those who control you will lose control. I wrote from age 12 to age 32, obsessively for 20 years in a row without break, I've been rejected by everyone the whole time, no one out there has been continuously rejected like I have, so I just kept on continuously going into my own space and writing more and more. Not caring about money or controlling people for selfish gain or any of that, I was just going on a self-journey.

Netflixs CEO says entertainment pills could be the next big thing,"link Everyone is familiar with the saying 'Netflix and Chill,' but Netflix CEO Reed Hastings has an even better idea, 'Netflix and Chill Pill.' That's not the actual brand or product name, but more of a concept that Hastings introduced at a recent tech conference for the Wall Street Journal. When speaking about the future of Netflix, Hastings said that, while movies and TV shows may be all the rage now, he anticipates they'll eventually become obsolete and will be rivaled by pharmaceutical substitutes, ""like a pill that entertains you."" This according to a tweet from the Wall Street Journal. Netflix's CEO says entertainment pills could be the next big thing This article struck me as funny....so Netflix own CEO is saying the next big thing in entertainment at home is a pill? I wonder how close his ties are with BIG PHARMA? This is a really crazy thing for a CEO of a major company to be suggesting....drugs for entertainment purposes...sounds like he is trying to progress towards legalization of something to actually entertain us while we watch TV. Coming soon to a pharmacy near you...The Netflix and Chill Pill....knowing what ""Netflix and Chill"" actually means I think the phrase he used kinda promotes rape in the form he said it though....""here baby...take this pill before we start the movie....don't worry....it is for entertainment purposes"" Anywho....just the next big thing in drugs for our mindless youth to get caught up in!",1

I declare myself a conscientious objector,"I declare myself a conscientious objector page: 1 link With tensions as they are and a war on the horizon I have decided to declare myself a conscientious objector. The UK does not need to start a war in Syria, it does not need to start fight with Russia. None of that has any reliavance to the UK or its saftey! In fact it would make us more unsafe! War in these curmstances would not be for my defence. And in my opinion violence is only nessary or justified in self defence. Russias leaders have acted disgrafully. But our leaders in the USA and UK are equally as bad. For every Crimea there's a Iraq, for every Syria a Libya. There is no moral high ground, the USA or UK has no right to point fingers, nor does Russia. I will therefore refuse to support (directly or indirectly), take part in or contribute (beyond taxes) anything. My only exception being unarmed medical services that I will give neutrally to BOTH sides equally. In the unlikely event of a call up I will choose prison. I will not actively support or aid the other side beyond medical and humanitarian aid. Call me a traitor, a coward or anything you like, this is my decision . I want NO part in any looming conflict. edit on 27-10-2016 by crazyewok because: (no reason given) edit on 27-10-2016 by crazyewok because: (no reason given)",1
Heartless Trump cuts sweet old grannys water supply,"Heartless Trump cuts sweet old granny's water supply page: 1 link A 92-year-old Scottish widow is forced to drink stream water she collects in a wheelbarrow because Donald Trump refuses to fix the damage caused by builders working on his ¬£1billion golf course. Grandmother Molly Forbes, 92, has refused to leave her cottage on the edge of Trump's golf resort in the tiny village of Balmedie, on the Aberdeenshire coast. The property developer and presidential hopeful, 70, has consistently tried to move Mrs Forbes and her son Michael from their home, which he has branded an 'eyesore'. Only a cold-blooded monster like Trump would be capable of something like this. He's been systematically bullying this innocent silver-haired grandmother to force her out of her property. Not only has he forced her to collect water daily at her frail old age, he is also keeping her from having a good night's sleep: Mrs Forbes says she has been subjected to an appalling campaign of intimidation, which allegedly includes cutting off the water supply to her property, floodlighting her bedroom window at night so she cannot sleep and building a massive wall against her property. She also claims security guards have tried to intimidate her by appearing at all hours of the day and night. Despite all this, she is determined not to be driven out. Source What is this vile man going to do to her next? Grope her? We must do all we can to support this sweet old granny and her son on their battle against ruthless Trump, and Trump must be forced to repair her water and leave them alone. This has gone too far! If this isn't proof that Trump is pure evil, I don't know what is. (Did I do this right?)",1
Jubilee Year of Mercy ends on November 20. Following Judgment?,"Jubilee Year of Mercy ends on November 20. Following Judgment? page: 1 Jesus to St Faustina: You will prepare the world for My final coming. (Diary 429) Speak to the world about My mercy ... It is a sign for the end times. After it will come the Day of Justice. While there is still time, let them have recourse to the fountain of My mercy. (Diary 848) Tell souls about this great mercy of Mine, because the awful day, the day of My justice, is near. (Diary 965). I am prolonging the time of mercy for the sake of sinners. But woe to them if they do not recognize this time of My visitation. (Diary 1160) Before the Day of Justice, I am sending the Day of Mercy. (Diary 1588) He who refuses to pass through the door of My mercy must pass through the door of My justice. (Diary 1146). The Jubilee Year of Mercy proclaimed by pope Francis, ends on November 20th the feast of Christ the King the end of the liturgical year. Every jubilee year is destined to end of course, that's why it is a year and not a decade.But...isn't it too much prophecy gathered in that last year? First of all, the Catholics expect earnestly the 100th anniversary of Fatima. The 100th year started on October 13 and would end on October 13, 2017. As pope Benedict said during his pontificate on his trip to Fatima, the 100th year will see the Fatima secrets fulfilled. Then, we had all kinds of predictions recently. Let only remember the once at the time Jewish rabbis predictions of the year 5776, encoded in Bible codes according to some of them, that also appeared to be the 49th jubilee year since the retaking of Jerusalem. ""Nothing happened, again"" would say many. Much happened in terms that might be the last quiet year before the events. Then we have the enigmatic wishes on the last Christmas of both pope and queen as if that would be our last Christmas? The wordings were vague enough to draw firm conclusion, anyway they were said and stirred public interest. There are more predictions, such as of major Solar kill shot, that even president Obama signed orders in case it happens. The French foreign minister said of 500 days before climate chaos, days that expired last Fall. How much more mercy is envisioned by God, in what time frames? If the sequence given in Garabandal of Great Warning- Miracle - Chastisement is to be accomplished before the 100th anniversary of Fatima, it seems God's mercy towards the entire world would end in less than a year time. The only possible date for the Miracle in 2017 would fall on April 13, Holy Thursday. Let make a distinction, mercy to individuals who accepted God's loving call, NEVER ENDS! But God is a just judge at the same time. The Chastisement is predicted by too many prophecies and cannot be disregarded as nonsense. Moreover,t he world today is in a worse shape than during the end of the Cold War. I don't know what exactly will follow, there are variety of scenarios each of them having its own justification and logic to exist. May be a combination of them will happen in reality. What is exactly Great Warning, is it only what is said to be by numerous seers, far not only those in Garabandal? For me it should include ET-angelic component. Time will tell. Time that runs out, according to Anguera and other apparitions of Virgin Mary. That doesn't mean it has all to happen on December 1st. Every next week draws us closer to the two doors, one of which is the Door of Mercy and the other the Door of Justice. Your take on recent catholic prophecy? Or may be protestant or orthodox one? edit on 27-10-2016 by 2012newstart because: (no reason given) edit on 27-10-2016 by 2012newstart because: (no reason given)",1

Turkey can go too. This is right, and not only for warmongerers reasons! But we also should not forget that these miniature states are only used too, like the rest of dumb europe. By the anglo-american axis, some call it meanwhile the new axis of evil. Bceause, for the simple reason that russia didn¬¥t break made promises, after the Globalists ""reunited"" Germany, let¬¥s better say brought down the wall(To be honest, there is no unity between german people, often not even in the own families, less than ever between the east and west of germany). The broken promises were about the eastward enlargement of the NATO. NATO's Eastward Expansion Did the West Break Its Promise to Moscow? ""Russian President Dmitry Medvedev has accused the West of breaking promises made after the fall of the Iron Curtain, saying that NATO's expansion into Eastern Europe violated commitments made during the negotiations over German reunification. Newly discovered documents from Western archives support the Russian position."" Russia didn¬¥t expand his military troops to the borders of the USA or UK, didn¬¥t build a rocket shield in Mexico, Canada or elsewhere at the borders of the USA. I read right now that Orban acts the same like Erdolf aka Erdogan. The last hungarian newspaper that reported about the criminal acts of the Orban family, the ""N√©pszabads√°g"" was closed down, freedom of the press is almost terminated now. And those EU puppets send taxmoney to such states and get nothing but problems back, but don¬¥t even try to stop such Hobby Hitlers. Good that Erdolfistan is not in the EU like hungaria and the other ""want revenge from russia"" liliputh states. And the people that elected Orban, just for anti-refugee and othe Nazi reasons, for nothing else? Another year under Orban and they will end as refugees in western europe! That will become embarrassing for the anti-refugee masses... To come to an end. It¬¥s obvisiously the ""west"" who is playing foul, playing foul and nothing else than that, at least since 9/11. The anglo-american axis(the modern mass surveillance pioneers) is surrounding russia, not russia the ""west""(and is using it¬¥s idiot european ""partners"" for this). It¬¥s not russia that covers every part of the world with his military and his eavesdrop stations. It¬¥s not russia that ""owns"" almost unsinkable aircraft carries like Germany(38.500 US troops in germany), for example. It¬¥s not russia that stores nuke in germany, that we germans aren¬¥t even allowed to own or store on our territory. The NSA isn¬¥t russian. TTIP, CETA, NAFTA, TISA and all that, isn¬¥t russian. The bankster crash 2008 was not based in russia. The robber baron capitalism that ""feeds"" a few but exploits 99,9% is not coming from communism(though they learned fast how it works). Monsanto, Dupont etc, not russian. I could go on and on, but i have to come to an end.",1

Putin: stupid and unrealistic claims of impending war,"link a reply to: Profusion I must point out to you, that his statements are accurate. What is more, they are entirely appropriate to the situation. As we speak, proxy war is being fought by the destabilising forces of IS, sponsored by Western nations and interests by the back door, against the Assad regime. That regime is an ally of Russia. I am tired of pointing these things out, but to suggest that Russia is the problem, when for most of the last two decades, there has been western sponsored terrorism all over the most volatile region of the planet, smacks to me of the most unutterable witlessness. Russia is not the problem. I would not go as far as to say that it never was, and lets face it, the Russian government are not clean handed. But here is the thing... Russia cannot dishonour the British. It cannot dishonour the Americans. It can only make choices that make its nation look bad, and many of the choices it has made, with specific regard to its ACTUAL war effort against terror in Syria, have been absolutely legitimate, especially since they were not the cause of the problems there in the least. No... only OUR nations governments can dishonour us, and dishonour us they do. Every gun that makes its way from America and Britain, into the hands of a terrorist, dishonours us. Every time those weapons we sell the terrorists by the back door, are used to kill an innocent, we are dishonoured, stained with blood we would not wish to be shed. Our leaders, those of America and Britain not to mention other allies, THEY are the problem here. Their meddling, proxy warring, greed and hunger for power are the problem. They are the problem because we pay the taxes that make it possible. They are the problem because we did not give them permission to do these things in our name, because we would not want these things done in our name, and because they are supposed to be our representatives. No backstabbing, soft handed, work shy bastard represents me. No assemblage of schemers and game players represents me. No such mob represents my people on their best day, because on our best day the British people are not cold, evil, calculating and prepared to screw anyone to succeed. On our best day, even the least of us has more fair play and determination to do right than our government have. The same can be said a thousand fold for the leadership of the United States. We are not evil people, and yet we have allowed evil people to usurp the purpose of the tithe taken from our labour, to turn our effort, sweat and blood, into bloodshed overseas. We have had enemies made for us, by people we have mindlessly elected to positions with which they cannot be trusted. And we have the gall to be concerned about RUSSIA? I despair, I absolutely despair! This is not a game, this is not politics, this is real life. We should be doing better with it, and we are not. We should not be sliding ever further to the right, and yet we are. We should not be accepting the programming, and yet that is precisely what is happening all over the world, and in the OP of this very post. We MUST take back control of our governments. We MUST prevent our leaders from continuing these outmoded concepts of proxy war and destabilisation. We MUST mend the things our leaders broke in our name, we MUST take responsibility for those things, and we must NEVER allow them to happen again. In the meantime, we must leave Russia to deal with the crisis in Syria, so that the nation can be rebuilt, its infrastructure repaired, its homes and cities bought back to a livable state, and so that we are not distracted by a war that could turn from a pantomime into an even greater tragedy than it already is. I tire of this bizarre and ridiculous charade that we are apparently too stupid to stop, too uncaring to prevent. It needs to end, and end today, yesterday, TEN DAMNED YEARS AGO OR MORE! Can we stop accepting the lies, the obfuscations, the programming we have been fed? Can we PLEASE start doing that as a group? Would that be too damned much to ask? Because to be quite frank, if we cannot even do that, then we deserve to burn in nuclear fire for a hundred years, because we are not going to do ourselves any favours continuing such a pathetic existence as our leaders have created for us, cattle like and willing to believe whatever we are told, except that the sound of the bolt gun ahead is anything to worry about. edit on 27-10-2016 by TrueBrit because: grammatical error correction.",1
"Conspiracy Theories deliverd to your door, anonymously.","link My first introduction to the world of conspiracy theories was a DVD I found while on vacation visiting my girlfriend in Kent, Ohio. There was a little bridge over a muddy area on a trail by the Cuyahoga river, and for some reason my girlfriend and I decided to take the muddy path instead of the bridge. Well, she slipped and fell, so I helped her up and we made our way back to the bridge to go across the sane way, when we saw a sleeve stapled to the outside of the wooden handrail with a DVD in it labeled simply with ""infowars.com Jesse Ventura 9/11"", and I grabbed it because... well, why not? Popped it in at her house and watched it, it was an episode or two from Jesse Ventura's show Conspiracy Theory, one about FEMA camps, one about 9/11, and then some reletively short clip of Alex Jones yelling at me, and ending with an audio clip of some guy preaching about the end times coming soon and needing to get right with Jesus or something. I dunno, I didn't listen much to him because I don't care a thing for religion. Anyhow, that's at least what opened my mind, so to speak, to this world of conspiracy. True or not, most of them are entertaining at least. So, I can't say they were delivered to my door. Far from it in fact, they were instead hidden on a park trail 600 miles away from home.",1

Must be impeach of a hand,"Must be impeach of a hand page: 1 link Mingling through some thoughts tonight on thoughts of current events and the next president. No matter who wins, there will be plenty of baggage being brought into the White House. Between tapes and recordings being uncovered to Wikileaks and Project Veritas, corruption and ethical immoralities run deep in both candidates. The drips and leaks from both ends of the mudpit seem to be coming to a fever pitch. Will it end on Nov.9 or will there still be more. Could each side be holding on to a real key piece of damning material to have our future POTUS impeached? This brings up the choices of VP. Kaine and Pence. Now I could just be a tad ignorant here, but I've never heard of either one of them. I understand that they've had minor roles in government however the choices struck me as odd. Were these two possibly chosen for them? Are they the backup plan?",1
Universe is a hologram/virtual reality - But why? Could it be this?,"link Okay, we are all familiar with the theory that our universe is some sort of simulation, math that works so specifically, so well, so many predictions from math and science that are proved right more and more often etc and so on. (not going to get into ""proof"" google it!) So you have to ask yourself WHY would a thing, being, God, whatever want to create such a virtual simulation? We know that we as humans have the right to live and have family's, often with as many kids as sustainable (at the time). This means that however well we create food, we WILL use up all resources on this planet weather we make the best plans or not. But we cant crack viable ways to leave this planet and populate others beyond our own slowly decaying star. So what about this. What if the answer was to create a sped up reality, using all our computing and programming powers to emulate the universe (or observable universe), wait for life to grow on a planet and then give them the same problem we have so that we can reap the answer for ourselves? LEAVING THE SOLAR SYSTEM TO COLONISE OTHER SYSTEMS, INDEFINITELY. Could it be as simple as that? Love to hear your thoughts, been thinking about this for some time now.",1

His Heavensent episode was absolutely... Awesome. a reply to: sanitizedinfo Sorry to derail the thread! God is Time, eh? Hm, that's actually pretty thought provoking.

Tom deLonge: Changing the cynical views of youth towards government,"link IMO, here is what is happening. you guys are jumping to conclusions by not having any context and taking this at face value. I've been into this a very long time, and with that perspective I see some repeating patterns. To the point of the op, this is the same old same old--with a new generation of players. We've seen the same exact thing over the last 70 years with people like George Adamski, David Fry, Billy Meier, William Moore, and Steven Greer. It's the same story: A privileged individual is given the keys to open a few doors about what ""really is happening."" Tom DeLonge believes (and that's all it takes) he has been given these keys, and he's running with it, as his handlers knew he would. Tom sees this whole ""Sekret Machines"" schtick as a ""franchise."" That's how he talks about it. when he says ""franchise"" he's talking in George Lucas Star Wars terms with movie tie-ins, merchandise, graphic novels, coffee cups, t-shirts, and back packs. That's his vision for this. He sees opportunity to make this thing BIG. Now, he's been writing to Podesta and who knows who else, but he and we know Podesta has an interest in UFOs. So Podesta is seen by Tom as an ""in"" for what he perceives as the new administration and he is offering himself as a legitimate representative of his generation. His statement to Podesta is one of POSITIONING HIMSELF as a natural go-between for these issues--especially with ""young people."" It has nothing really to do with young people being disenfranchised and cynical and everything to do with Tom DeLonge taking an important position vis-a-vis ""Disclosure."" If DeLonge pulls this off it won't be Stephen Bassett of the Paradigm Research Group or Steven Greer, who ""once had dinner with the head of the CIA"" whose name is forever associated with ""Disclosure."" The name everyone will remember is Tom DeLonge. THAT'S what is happening here. DeLonge is attempting to position himself to take major advantage of what he now thinks is reality, and which also includes a major Star-Wars-sized ""franchise"" that has the potential of turning him from a mere multi-millionaire into something much larger. Of course, he may also be a dupe and or delusional, but he may not know that yet. edit on 10/27/2016 by schuyler because: (no reason given)",1
"War On Islam, As Islam Only Wants War. No Peace.","link I am sure that this post will fall on deaf ears. I am also sure that this may not be the best place to make any form of impact as let's be honest. I do not think many muslim's reside on this website and if they do, then I am sure they will defend their side just as usual. Tommy Robinson (also known as Stephen Christopher Yaxley-Lennon) is the co-founder and leader of the English Defence League. Some of you who know this man may already, may have opinions about him because of his creation of the EDL and what some of its members have been known to behave like. However, Tommy Robinson in my eyes is one of the very few, if not the only person to stand up to the islamist movement in this country. It is a good thing he is around whether you respect him or not as islamists have one thing in common, they have a lot to loose and also a lot to gain either way. Just like anyone that stands up to a movement like islam, its always a difficult one. Considering England has been asleep for to long to even notice what is going on under its nose. Everyone thinks England is promoting multiculturalism by allowing Islam to move freely within this country but islam and its ways are not to get along peacefully, they want western cultures out completely. If left to their own devices, England will be taken over within 10 - 20 years or sooner. Here is a short video of Tommy Robinson travelling through his local town and regardless of him being the main man of the EDL he is not being abusive to anyone yet this is the kind of treatment a born and raised English man gets in his own home town. As you can tell in the video above. Disgusting behaviour by disgusting people who are using their faith as a scape goat to instil fear, scaremonger and literally drive out English people from there home towns. How? Because people of England are sitting back and not sharing their fears about such extremism in their own country. Also a big shame is that the younger generation are being taught to accept anyone and everyone and although this is a beautiful message to portray this is the root cause of Islam continuing to grow. You will see in many debates get side tracked by blank statements made by younger generations about such political points only to end up with a nonsensical opinion that gets us nowhere. The older generation are tired of fighting, so we have only this moment in time to get those capable, those noticing changes in the UK and America and many other places to realise what is occurring before there is no one of the right age to know how things have changed. Desensitisation is the worry here. There is so much to cover a topic like this could last pages and pages, however I just want to point out a few things. The rest should be up to conversation. The current state of moderate muslims is not a thing. A muslim lives by the faith of Islam and if they had to side with one or the other, they would side with Islam. This should be cause of concern because even though they deem themselves not the same or as severe, they are in fact, just as severe. Basically they are sleeper cells being created within our very own country. They are not here to live peacefully along side us either. They are here to promote their faith and grow, growing means pushing more and more on other faiths that for many years have lived together, peacefully. Only until now, has this country had problems like this. I am not here to promote Tommy Robinson but I am here to state that this mans points should be heard. If you have the time now or again, give this video below a watch. He explains very well where things have gone, are going and will end up. Not just in the UK but everywhere in the world that does nothing about this. edit on 27-10-2016 by BlackProject because: (no reason given)",1
NASA's gateway to deep space,"NASA‚Äôs gateway to deep space page: 1 www.abovetopsecret.com... Now, it sems that NASA is making good on his promise and is moving forward with the plan by establishing a Deep-Space Habitat near the Moon to test out systems for people who would live in orbit or travel long distances in Space; a gateway to deep space NASA plans to address its problem by parking a ‚Äúdeep space‚Äù habitat in a location near the Moon, which astronauts could visit and use to become acclimated to life beyond low-Earth orbit. President Obama mentioned deep space habitats earlier this month, when he reiterated his call for NASA to send humans to Mars. ‚ÄúI'm excited to announce that we are working with our commercial partners to build new habitats that can sustain and transport astronauts on long-duration missions in deep space,‚Äù Obama said. This wasn‚Äôt really a new announcement, as NASA has been working on the habitat program for a couple of years. Nevertheless, before the president's mention, this NextSTEP program had received surprisingly little attention given its significance‚Äîit might be the most important contract NASA awards for next decade. As Obama said, NASA has embarked upon a ""Journey to Mars."" While the plan may change to include lunar landings as a stepping stone to Mars, the space agency does intend to try and venture back into deep space for the first time since the Apollo program. Whatever destination it chooses, NASA's ambitions will begin with the deep space habitat, because it is an affordable first step, costing hundreds of millions or a few billion dollars initially, instead of multiple billions needed for a full-blown expedition to the Moon's surface, Mars or elsewhere in deep space. ""This is the right next step,"" Simon said. ""We need to understand how to live in deep space, how to live off of our planet."" The first habitat launched in the 2020s won‚Äôt be exactly the same as the vehicle NASA eventually sends to Mars. Rather, it will serve as a prototype to help the space agency understand the capabilities, technologies, and systems needed for astronauts to survive for long periods in deep space. Some of those systems can be tested on the ground or the existing space station, but others can only be tested further from Earth. This venture is part of the Next step program initiated by NASA: www.nasa.gov... NextSTEP is a public-private partnership model that seeks commercial development of deep space exploration capabilities to support more extensive human space flight missions in the Proving Ground around and beyond cislunar space‚Äîthe space near Earth that extends just beyond the moon. So far, NASA has partnered with 6 companies in this effort: Bigelow Aerospace, Boeing, Lockheed Martin, Orbital ATK, Sierra Nevada Corporation, and NanoRacks. This is great, ATS! I am very excited at this news, even with all of the morbidity we have in the world today; I'm still excited for the future..! This is an ambitious plan..can US aerospace companies pull this off alone, or should this be more of a global effort? What does ATS think?",1

Yet it‚Äôs also true that for Americans who don‚Äôt get insurance through work, and who make too much money to qualify for federal subsidies, the cost of health coverage is about to soar dramatically, with premiums sometimes rising $1,000, even over $2,000 for the year. If one were making 45k per year and the cost of a service increased 1k-2k for THAT year one would find other service providers or not use the service at all. But if you did not pay for health insurance you would owe the irs a penalty of 2k.

The way it was before Obamacare was much much better for everyone except the one's with pre-existing conditions. It's a shame we couldn't have someone who was smart enough to grasp that.

Planet Nine,"link I want to preface this by saying there is no ""Planet X"" IMO as pertains to the views of such a planet that many on this board hold. However, I have always felt there was a massive missing planet as we could never satisfactorily explain perturbations of a planet like Jupiter and the movement of outer objects. The view that there is a missing massive planet has always been on the table and NASA has always supported the idea and never stood in the way of people trying to find proof of it. We know planets, often many, orbit stars in this outer region, why should we be different? Link: Planet X Overview, Source: NASA Caltech researchers have found evidence suggesting there may be a ""Planet X"" deep in the solar system. This hypothetical Neptune-sized planet orbits our sun in a highly elongated orbit far beyond Pluto. The object, which the researchers have nicknamed ""Planet Nine,"" could have a mass about 10 times that of Earth and orbit about 20 times farther from the sun on average than Neptune. It may take between 10,000 and 20,000 Earth years to make one full orbit around the sun. But this is all from January you might say, quite old and possibly already discussed. Fast forward to my news feed for today and what do I find? Narrowing the field for the 9th planet Batygin and Brown's work narrowed down the planet‚Äôs possible mass and orbit to areas where previous observations might have missed it. Their calculations suggest that it has a mass between five to 20 times that of Earth‚Äîa figure that is key to knowing the approximate size of the object they are looking for. They also suggest that its orbit is likely tilted about 30 degrees compared to the plane of the solar system‚Äîthe relatively thin, flat zone in which the eight major planets orbit. They also propose that the planet is now likely near its farthest point from the sun, in the sky's northern hemisphere, and that it likely has an elongated orbit averaging between 380 and 980 astronomical units (AU) from the sun. (One AU is the average distance between Earth and the sun.) We are on the virge of finding a very real planet in our outer solar system. They previsouly released this model for what the orbit could look like: And they've created 100+ more of those which have not yet been published. n an as-yet unpublished set of about 100 new high-resolution computer simulations, Batygin says he and Brown have narrowed down Planet Nine's location to a roughly 600- to 800-square degree patch of sky. The biggest piece of proof has turned out to be the very tilt of our solar system from the perspective of the inner planets. Bailey and her colleagues ran computer simulations that suggest that the tilt of the eight official planets can be explained by the gravitational influence of Planet Nine ""over the 4.5-billion-years-ish lifetime of the solar system,"" Bailey told Space.com. This is fascinating stuff!",1

Best Forgotten,"I feel emotions with such depth and intensity they seem so familiar as if lived before, like deja vu they leave their residue, images form and bounce back and forth between heart and mind. It is mercy that I have forgotten so much more than remembered, time has allowed me to change and redefine them, such a crushing and heavy load to carry otherwise. If I am defined by those lost memories what am I? A loop between my heart and mind, thoughts and feelings rise and fall. Thoughtful ruminations give way to painful images and recollections. Oh there are good, even wonderful memories. I hang on to them like an album of pictures, I turn the pages and revisit those good times. They chronicle by not so much as what they show but what they don't. some are filled with regret, others live in denial, always hoping for a happy ending.

"What is one more election thread, ehhh?","a reply to: kruphix Theocracy? Tim Kaine? In September 1980, as violence and civil war erupted throughout Central America, a quiet American left Harvard Law School to volunteer with Jesuit missionaries in northern Honduras. Around him, the United States-backed military dictatorship hunted Marxists and cracked down on the Catholic clergy for preaching empowerment to peasant farmers. But some locals also looked warily on the bearded and mop-haired Midwesterner in their midst. Just a few hours south, the Central Intelligence Agency was using Honduras as a staging ground in its covert war against Latin American communism, with right-wing forces training for operations in El Salvador and Nicaragua. ‚ÄúSome of the people were wondering what‚Äôs going on, who is this guy?‚Äù Tim Kaine, then a 22-year-old volunteer and now the Democratic nominee for vice president, said in an interview.

Far from being a C.I.A. operative, Mr. Kaine was a young Catholic at a crossroads, undergoing a spiritual shift as he awakened to the plight of the deeply poor in Honduras. In its far-flung pueblos, banana plantation company towns and dusty cities, Mr. Kaine embraced an interpretation of the gospel, known as liberation theology, that championed social change to improve the lives of the downtrodden. In Honduras, his recitation of the traditional Catholic mealtime blessing changed to ‚ÄúLord give bread to those who hunger, and hunger for justice to those who have bread.‚Äù Honduran military leaders, American officials and even Pope John Paul II viewed liberation theology suspiciously, as dangerously injecting Marxist beliefs into religious teaching.

Obamacare is Meant to Fail in Order to Usher in Government-Run Socialist Health Care,"link The oligarchy runs our society with Problem ‚Äì Reaction ‚Äì Solution. If anything, these leaks have proven beyond a shadow of a doubt that the two-party system is an illusion and the whole construct is one huge pay-for-play corporate sham. Obamacare was always meant to destroy the private health care system and usher in single-payer, government run socialist medicine. It was designed that way‚Ä¶ and it‚Äôs ‚Äúworking‚Äù. Related: Link In this particular e-mail, we get to see just how fake and fraudulent our government is. Your health determines how valuable of an asset you are and it‚Äôs the main reason why we see ‚Äúhealth tracking apparel‚Äù and ‚Äúhealth scores,‚Äù designed by and for prominent health insurance companies in order to track your health data in-between doctor visits.

I‚Äôd be open to a range of options to do that. But we have to be careful that the R version passes which begins the unraveling of the ACA.‚Äù Do you still have any doubts? Sadly, there are those who have benefited from the ACA, but to a greater extent, many have seen the exact opposite of what was promised. Higher rates, less coverage, new doctors, etc‚Ä¶ A Democrat supporting Republican legislation to destroy Obamacare on purpose. How many millions have they raked in on this deal and bilked the American people for in Obamacare penalties because they can‚Äôt afford the ‚Äúaffordable‚Äù health care? And the American people will look at this like a ‚Äúvictory‚Äù when it does unravel, even though it has been the plan all along. Which reminds me, when was the last time that the people had a victory? This just goes to show you that what is good for the goose isn‚Äôt always good for the gander. They knew that going in and only after the fact, can we realize this. They wanted the ganders‚Äô money while the goose that benefits (through subsidiaries), cries to defend the ACA, making the rest of us look insensitive and unfair. Good plan‚Ä¶ They‚Äôre all working together, folks. Obamacare was always meant to fail ‚Äî on purpose ‚Äî to bring in a single-payer, government-controlled socialist medicine system. Don‚Äôt believe me yet? Back in 2013, Senator Harry Reid had this to say about the ACA‚Ä¶ Sen. Harry Reid: Obamacare 'Absolutely' A Step Toward A Single-Payer System When I speak to conservatives about health care policy, I‚Äôm often asked the question: ‚ÄúDo you think that Obamacare is secretly a step toward single-payer health care?‚Äù I always explain that, while progressives may want single-payer, I don‚Äôt think that Obamacare is deliberately designed to bring about that outcome. Well, yesterday on PBS‚Äô Nevada Week In Review , Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid (D., Nev.) was asked whether his goal was to move Obamacare to a single-payer system. His answer? ‚ÄúYes, yes. Absolutely, yes.‚Äù The plan to undermine your health and sufficiency is so diabolical and disgusting, that many would simply refuse to believe such a thing. Well, there it is folks. They don‚Äôt give a damn about you or your well-being and will do anything in their power to see that decisions about your health are made by them in the future. For me personally, the ACA has increased my premium by 300%, causing me to drop what was offered by my employer and settle with less coverage for more money using the ""marketplace.""

NASA to test in flight folding wing,"NASA to test in flight folding wing page: 1 link NASA is set to begin testing a new wing design that would change shape in flight, bending up or down, to increase yaw stability, reduce required rudder size, and decrease drag. The Boeing 777X is set to introduce wingtips that fold on the ground, to allow the aircraft to fit in existing gates with a longer wingspan. NASA is set to begin testing the Spanwise Adaptive Wing, which would add shape-memory alloy actuators to the wingtip area that would bend the tips up or down. The SMA actuators would activate when heated electrically, so there is no need for complex hydraulic lines or actuators. Beginning in Spring of 2017, NASA will start flying the Area-I PTERA UAV. It has a 176 inch wingspan, with the outer 15 inches moving as far as 75 degrees up or down. PTERA is not set up for SAW, but it appears that it could see a 40% rudder authority. The idea behind SAW is similar to what was done with the XB-70, with the wingtips angled down. Boeing will introduce folding wings to commercial aviation when the 777X airliner enters service at the end of 2019. But the devices could become commonplace on future aircraft as wingspans increase in an effort to reduce drag and fuel burn. The 777X has almost 24 ft. more wingspan than today‚Äôs 777 to optimize lift distribution and maximize cruise efficiency. Folding the tips on the ground keeps the larger aircraft compatible with existing taxiway and gate size restrictions. But NASA is investigating whether also folding the wing in flight could save still more fuel. The Spanwise Adaptive Wing (SAW) concept will be tested on the ground and in flight in a rapid feasibility assessment under NASA‚Äôs new Convergent Aeronautics Solutions project. The goal is to show that angling the outboard wing sections up or down can increase yaw stability and control, and reduce rudder size and tail drag.",1

My how 2 year's passage of time has changed the narrative. A top Ukrainian army officer said a ""full-scale invasion"" of his country was under way Thursday, as a U.S. official said up to 1,000 Russian troops had crossed Ukraine's southern border to fight alongside pro-Russian rebels. Russia's military actions in eastern Ukraine ""must cease immediately,"" British Prime Minister David Cameron said Thursday. ""I'm extremely concerned by mounting evidence that Russian troops have made large-scale incursions into South Eastern Ukraine, completely disregarding the sovereignty of a neighbor,"" Cameron said. ""The international community has already warned Russia that such provocative actions would be completely unacceptable and illegal."" Yet another example of the west's never ending ""NATO good, Russia evil"" narrative. When Russia involves 1,000 troops in assisting a region which requested their help (Crimea, or more recently Syria) the western leaders come unglued... but when the west does the same, it's ""exercises"" and ""no cause for any concern.""

Homeless TRUMP Supporter Guards Donald Trump's Star on Hollywood Blvd,"Homeless TRUMP Supporter Guards Donald Trump‚Äôs Star on Hollywood Blvd page: 1 On Wednesday a violent leftist smashed Donald Trump‚Äôs star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame. The culprits used a sledgehammer to destroy Donald‚Äôs star. The person who was watching Trumps star had an anti-immigration sign and is pro-trump. Later another homeless man took up the watch to keep Trumps star on Hollywood BLVD safe. From the video it looks like the star had already been replaced. Could this be a plant? And has Trump secured the homeless vote? Everybody's looking for a gimmick, and their 15 minutes of fame. Sad, really. Really sad. Maybe he wants a home. Another stinkin' deplorable. link Ill bet Hillary laughs at him because he is homeless and like Trump. I would give him money if I lived there. The violent destructive liberals just cant stop stealing signs, spray painting buildings and now vandalizing a sidewalk, wow but not surprised, the liberals have been so dirty not only Hillary and her supporters but her whole entourage that it makes this years election a new low in lows and sets a really bad example for the next election.",1
Scientists say weird signals from space are 'probably' aliens,"Scientists say weird signals from space are ‚Äòprobably‚Äô aliens A team of astronomers believes that strange signals emanating from a cluster of stars are actually aliens trying to tell the universe they exist. The study, which appeared in the Publications of the Astronomical Society of the Pacific, analyzed the odd beams of light from 234 stars ‚Äî a fraction of the 2.5 million that were observed. The bizarre beacons led the paper‚Äôs authors, Ermanno F. Borra and Eric Trottier from Laval University in Quebec, to conclude that it‚Äôs ‚Äúprobably‚Äù aliens. ‚ÄúWe find that the detected signals have exactly the shape of an [extraterrestrial intelligence] signal predicted in the previous publication and are therefore in agreement with this hypothesis,‚Äù wrote Borra and Trottier. They also note that their findings align with the Extraterrestrial Intelligence (ETI) hypothesis, since the mysterious activity only occurred in a tiny fraction of stars. The hypothesis also suggests that an intelligent life force would use a more sophisticated optical beacon than, say, radio waves to reveal its existence. Click link for article... **MODS - If this is a duplicate please delete / and or lock ** So apparently signals detected from 230+ stars are fitting the hypothesized parameters established for extraterrestrial intelligence. The stars in question also fit the hypothesized parameters for supporting life. Since only a small amount of stars in the area being looked at are fitting the parameters they are using that as further evidence in support of their claims. Thoughts?",1
Can normal transistors act like a qubit?,"Can normal transistors act like a qubit? page: 1 link Hi. I guess I have a question relating to quantum computing. Since qubits are what makes up quantum computers... That being a qubits can act like a transistor that can be either on, off, or both on and off at the same time. In usual computing... Transistors are either on or off. In quantum they can be both on and off at the same time... The question I have is simply this. Is it possible to make a transistor that can act as on, off, and on and off at the same time... Even if you had to add an extra layer of circuitry to get that same reading from that single transistor? I mean. A normal transistor operate that if it gets no voltage or low voltage then the transistor is in an off state. If it gets a certain voltage it is in an on state. Couldn't you make the voltage extra high to get a both on/off at the same time state? Or half voltage to get the same on/off state at the same time to essentially create a fake qubit scenario? There might have to be additional transistors to help make sure of that determination of a transistor appearing in an on/off state but couldn't it be possible? Perhaps a circuit of transistors could determine whether the proceeding transistor should act as both on/off by checking the voltage some how? Idk... Please answer me like I'm a drunk stupid idiot. Perhaps laymen terms? I can be quite the idiot sometimes. Thanks for hearing me out. I'm currently drunk and just pondering things link a reply to: DaRAGE I'm sure we could do weird stuff with circuitry to store more than one bit of data in the circuit, but that doesn't really give an advantage over just storing more bits with our conventional technology (which has been highly refined). The advantage of the qbit isn't really that it stores more information, it's that it can be used to process more information at the same time. Quantum + computing = quantum computing The key features of an ordinary computer‚Äîbits, registers, logic gates, algorithms, and so on‚Äîhave analogous features in a quantum computer. Instead of bits, a quantum computer has quantum bits or qubits, which work in a particularly intriguing way. Where a bit can store either a zero or a 1, a qubit can store a zero, a one, both zero and one, or an infinite number of values in between‚Äîand be in multiple states (store multiple values) at the same time! If that sounds confusing, think back to light being a particle and a wave at the same time, Schr√∂dinger's cat being alive and dead, or a car being a bicycle and a bus. A gentler way to think of the numbers qubits store is through the physics concept of superposition (where two waves add to make a third one that contains both of the originals). If you blow on something like a flute, the pipe fills up with a standing wave: a wave made up of a fundamental frequency (the basic note you're playing) and lots of overtones or harmonics (higher-frequency multiples of the fundamental). The wave inside the pipe contains all these waves simultaneously: they're added together to make a combined wave that includes them all. Qubits use superposition to represent multiple states (multiple numeric values) simultaneously in a similar way. Just as a quantum computer can store multiple numbers at once, so it can process them simultaneously. Instead of working in serial (doing a series of things one at a time in a sequence), it can work in parallel (doing multiple things at the same time). Only when you try to find out what state it's actually in at any given moment (by measuring it, in other words) does it ""collapse"" into one of its possible states‚Äîand that gives you the answer to your problem. Estimates suggest a quantum computer's ability to work in parallel would make it millions of times faster than any conventional computer... if only we could build it! So how would we do that? explainthatstuff.com If I understand correctly, a quantum computer will just be a smaller, more energy efficient version of a massive parallel computer.",1
Podesta relative earned six-figure fees lobbying Clintons State Dept. during his tenure there,"This is how it works in the Clinton Cabal...or is it the Mainstream Mafia. 1) Qatar supports ISIS (just by the way) 2) Qatar wants to buy advanced U.S. missile defence systems, Apache attack helicopters and other military materiel 3) Ratheon (a big defence contractor) wants to sell said U.S. Military goods to Qatar 4) These kinds of foreign military sales have to be approved by the State Department 5) Hillary becomes Secretary of State 6) Hillary has a ""Charitable Foundation"" 7) Hillary has a former POTUS as her spouse 8) Hillary has a network of aides, confidants, bundlers and fundraisers at her beck and call (all part of the Clinton Organized Crime Family) 9) John Podesta (at that time)...yeah the same John Podesta who is having all of his emails released right now... held dual titles at the State Department: as a ""senior advisor"", and as a member of a foreign policy advisory board Secretary Clinton created. 10) Ratheon hires John Podesta's sister-in-law (Heather Podesta), along with John Merrigan and Matt Bernstein (both major donors or bundlers to Hillary Clinton‚Äôs 2008 and 2016 campaigns). This guaranteed them access to Hillary Clinton. 11) Qatar, meanwhile, donated millions to the Clinton Foundation.

"NATO, US, And UK Assemble Largest Troop Buildup On Russian Border Since Cold War","By John Vibes 
In the midst of deepening tension between US allies NATO and Russia, NATO is planning the largest military buildup along the Russian border since the cold war. 
NATO called on allied governments this week to contribute whatever troops and equipment they can to the effort. According to Reuters , thousands of troops are expected to arrive in the coming days and weeks. 
It was reported that Italy, France, Denmark and other European states are expected to join the NATO military divisions that will be led by the United States along Russia‚Äôs border. 
On Wednesday, Britain announced it is sending hundreds of soldiers and hardware to Russia‚Äôs borders as part of a huge military deployment. 
A total of 800 troops, drones and tanks are moving to Estonia as part of the biggest military build-up of NATO troops on Russia‚Äôs borders since the Cold War. 
In addition to the forces allocated for his specific operation, NATO has an army of over 40,000 ready to be called up to fight at any time. 
The US military claims that this threatening move is meant to act as a ‚Äúdeterrent‚Äù to the Russian military, but this is obvious a move that will escalate tensions and push towards a possible third world war. 
‚ÄúThis is a credible deterrence, not to provoke a conflict but to prevent conflict,‚Äù NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg said on Tuesday ‚Äî ironically ignoring the fact that it is a de facto provocation. 
Just imagine what would happen if Russian troops amassed along the Mexican border and told the US that this move was to ‚Äòprevent conflict.‚Äô 
The so-called Iskander-M cruise missiles can hit targets across Poland and the Baltics, although NATO officials declined to say if Russia had moved nuclear warheads to Kaliningrad. 
The United States‚Äô envoy to NATO, Douglas Lute, told reporters that NATO and the US military may consider Russia a threat if they had nuclear weapons within range of NATO‚Äôs deployment. This statement is insane considering the fact that the US military is the one that is many miles from home on the border of someone else‚Äôs lands. 
‚ÄúThis deployment, if it becomes permanent if the presence of nuclear weapons were confirmed, would be a change in (Russia‚Äôs) security posture,‚Äù Lute said. 
If anyone is a threat, it is NATO and the US government. 
These military tensions are the result of an ongoing proxy war in Syria, in which Western powers are attempting to institute a regime change in the country by funding violent rebel groups. Meanwhile, Russia has interests in keeping their allies in the Syrian government in control, putting the two superpowers at odds. 
Until now, Russia and the US have been fighting through third parties, just as they had during the previous Cold War, and the same type of situation is developing today.

Destruction of US Abrams Tank: Mosul Offensive Good for General Dynamics,"By Kurt Nimmo, Blacklisted News 
In the video below the ‚Äúfolk hero‚Äù of the Iraqi Counter-Terror Services and regular Iraqi army takes a direct hit in the battle for Mosul. 
The destruction of an Abrams tank by a Russian ATGM Kornet missile is good news if you‚Äôre a stockholder in General Dynamics Land Systems, formerly Chrysler Defense. 
General Dynamics makes the Abrams battle tank. 
Each one costs $9 million. 
The US will simply ship another tank to replace the one destroyed along with its presumed Iraqi crew. Iraqi lives are a cheap commodity, so it will not be a problem to find another expendable tank crew. 
Back in 2012 former Army Chief of Staff Gen. Raymond Odierno testified to Congress that the Army has more than enough tanks. He suggested the line at General Dynamics be shut down temporarily. ‚ÄúOur tank fleet is two and a half years old on average now. We‚Äôre in good shape and these are additional tanks that we don‚Äôt need,‚Äù he said. 
Congress budgeted more money for new tanks anyway. Rep. Mac Thornberry, a Texas Republican and chairman of the House Armed Services Committee, said more tanks were needed in Europe to confront Vladimir Putin. 
Military readiness is a ‚Äúconsumable,‚Äù said Maj. Gen. Thomas A. Horlander, the Army‚Äôs budget director. Military hardware is ‚Äúcumulative,‚Äù according to the Pentagon. 
On Tuesday General Dynamics stock opened at $151.21 and closed at $152.59. Last week the corporation was awarded a $170 million contract for an air-to-ground rocket system. Earlier this month General Dynamics was awarded a $900 million contract over five years to provide engineering and technical services for major weapon systems, program technical assistance, support systems requirements and assist with production decision-making and program controls, according to MarketWatch . 
The United States is the largest producer and exporter of weapons in the world. The US armed forces budget topped out over $600 billion in 2015.

Irony Redefined: ‚ÄúHuman Rights Champion‚Äù Suu Kyi Jails Dissidents,"By Tony Cartalucci 
Myanmar‚Äôs defacto leader, Aung San Suu Kyi of the National League for Democracy (NDL) political party, has paved her time since coming to power earlier this year with both irony and hypocrisy. She has not only illegally declared herself ‚Äúleader‚Äù of the Southeast Asian state in contravention of its constitution, she has also embarked on an iron-fisted purge of her political opponents identical to the one she fought against as she struggled to seize power to begin with. 
During elections earlier this year, Myanmar‚Äôs constitution prevented Suu Kyi from holding the nation‚Äôs highest office due to her inordinate amount of time overseas, her status of having been married to a foreign, and her children‚Äôs dual citizenship. Instead of adhering to the law, her party once in power, simply contrived an entirely new post for her, State Counsellor of Myanmar, which makes her the ‚Äúdefacto leader‚Äù of Myanmar. 
Canada‚Äôs The Globe and Mail in an article titled, ‚ÄúSt√©phane Dion says Aung San Suu Kyi is the ‚Äòde facto‚Äô leader of Myanmar,‚Äù would note that Canada‚Äôs government recognized this legal side-stepping, stating: 
Dion called Suu Kyi, now Myanmar‚Äôs foreign minister, ‚Äúthe de facto national leader‚Äù of her country ‚Äúbecause they have a strange rule that if you have married somebody who‚Äôs not of the country, you cannot be the leader of the government and of the state.‚Äù 
Suu Kyi, the internationally recognized democracy advocate, is barred from becoming president because her late husband was British, as are her two sons. The rule was crafted during Myanmar‚Äôs decades of military rule, which Suu Kyi fought against during years of house arrest before finally prevailing last fall. 
In essence, she is unelected, and illegally holding power. For a woman who‚Äôs Western backers ‚Äì particularly in the United States and United Kingdom ‚Äì have held her up as a champion for democracy and the rule of law, she and her party‚Äôs first act upon taking power was trampling both. The Inhumane Humanitarian 
Another myth built up around Nobel Peace Prize laureate Suu Kyi by the West has been her advocacy for ‚Äúhuman rights.‚Äù Her advocacy for human rights, however, appears only to extend out to protect only as far as her immediate political allies are concerned. For groups beyond this self-serving political protection, and particularly regarding her political opponents, she and her NDL are just as eager to jail, crush, or kill political opponents as they claimed the ruling military government had been. 
In addition to escalating violence targeting the nation‚Äôs Rohingya‚Äôs population, several activists online have been sent to jail for ‚Äúinsulting‚Äù the ruling government and Western-backed media fronts and organizations. 
Myanmar‚Äôs Eleven Media Group (EMG) in its article, ‚ÄúFacebook offender brought to court for insulting Suu Kyi,‚Äù attempted to distance what Suu Kyi and her political supporters had once called draconian censorship as now, a simple matter of enforcing the law. It would state: 
A Facebook user named Zaw Zaw (aka Nga Pha) was brought to the North Dagon Township court on October 24 to face prosecution for his defamatory posts about State Counsellor Aung San Suu Kyi. 
He has been charged under Section 66(d) of the Telecommunications Law. 
‚ÄúHe‚Äôs being sued for defamatory writing and photos about the State Counsellor [posted on Facebook],‚Äù said plaintiff Nay Myo Kyaw, a 34-year-old resident of North Okkalapa Township. 
Around 50 people showed up at the hearing wearing shirts affiliated with a group called the Network of Supporters of the Rule of Law. They shouted: ‚ÄúYou deserved it for insulting a good person.‚Äù 
The article also admits: 
The Myawady Township Court sentenced Aung Win Hlaing (aka A Nyar Thar), the first man to be prosecuted under the current government, for defamatory posts on Facebook about President Htin Kyaw, to nine months in jail after he was convicted under Section 66(d) of the Telecommunications Law. 
Aung Myint Tun (aka Ko Pho Htaung), a member of the National League for Democracy, is still facing legal action under the same law for the wording of a resignation letter. 
Another man named Yar Pyay was arrested and is being prosecuted for creating a fake Facebook account under the name of Nay Myo Wai, the chairman of Peace and Diversity Party. 
Hla Phone was also arrested and is being prosecuted for defamatory posts on Facebook about the Commander-in-Chief. 
EMG ‚Äì ironically awarded for its work in opposing the previous military-led government by Reporters without Borders ‚Äì would also admit that it itself had taken advantage of Myanmar‚Äôs laws to silence its own critics, claiming: 
Eleven Media Group (EMG) also filed complaints about repeated defamatory posts on Facebook against the group. Though EMG lodged complaints against film director Mike Tee, who is the owner of a Facebook account named Than Tun Zaw, and another Facebook user named Myat Maw for offensive posts about the group and its staff, the legal process has yet to begin. EMG lodged the complaints on January 27 and March 31 this year. 
One would expect such a tidal wave of abuse ‚Äì as defined by the West in regards to media, governance, and censorship around the world ‚Äì to be met with sweeping condemnation from the West‚Äôs various human rights advocacy organizations including Human Rights Watch, Amnesty International, and a no doubt embarrassed Reporters Without Borders ‚Äì yet the silence is as deafening as it is telling. Taking Over Where Accused Dictators Left Off 
The West‚Äôs champions of democracy, rule of law, and human rights in Myanmar appears to have simply taken over right where Suu Kyi and her NDL party had claimed the military-led government left off. And despite the overt nature of Suu Kyi‚Äôs breaches of Western standards of ‚Äúdemocracy‚Äù and ‚Äúhuman rights,‚Äù the US is on track to lift all sanctions from Myanmar as Suu Kyi and her government open the nation, its people, and its resources to exploitation by Western corporations. 
The overt nature of both the West‚Äôs and Suu Kyi‚Äôs hypocrisy illustrates that ‚Äúdemocracy,‚Äù ‚Äúrule of law,‚Äù and ‚Äúhuman rights‚Äù are merely facades behind which the West and its proxies wield their power ‚Äì hiding behind such principles rather than truly upholding them. And in reality, such behavior undermines these principles more than any overt abuse by an openly tyrannical regime ever could ‚Äì because genuine advocates thus become associated with hypocrites like the Western governments supporting the current regime in Myanmar, their faux-nongovernmental organizations aiding and abetting the regime, and proxies like Suu Kyi and her NDL themselves. 
International audiences must keep this example of hypocrisy in mind as the West attempts to overturn other governments in Southeast Asia and beyond under similar pretexts and using similar rhetoric ‚Äì supporting supposed ‚Äúpro-democracy‚Äù and ‚Äúpro-human rights‚Äù advocates who have every intention of trampling both upon seizing power.

The Globalization Of Media: A Failing Strike Force,"By Jon Rappoport 
I begin this piece with three quotes from my work-in-progress, The Underground: 
‚ÄúThere is a media metaphysics. Its basic principle states that nothing exists until it becomes information. Now we have a new twist: information only becomes real when it reaches a mind already attuned to it. In other words, the tree falling in the forest makes a sound only if a user/consumer who wants a tree to fall receives video and audio of the event‚Ä¶‚Äù 
‚ÄúInformation can be dressed up a thousand different ways. But it tends to have an ‚Äòelastic‚Äô quality. By that I mean you eventually get to see the person who dressed it up. That‚Äôs a problem for chronic liars who inhabit the press. They expose themselves, even though they don‚Äôt want to. It takes a surprisingly small push to expose the whole operation. This is happening now, right in front of our eyes.‚Äù 
‚ÄúThe basis of big media is theater. News is theater. Its directors and producers think they‚Äôre doing a first-rate job. But they‚Äôre sadly mistaken. Gaps and obfuscations are growing larger. The outright non-sequiturs and gibberish are becoming more apparent. The audience is wising up to the farce. Who are these fools who direct the news? They‚Äôre simply people who want to sell their souls and have found an elite buyer. But that transaction doesn‚Äôt contain any guarantees about shelf life. Mainstream news is decaying, and the expiration date is approaching. Like civilizations, the petty princes of information rise and fall‚Ä¶‚Äù 
Globalized media. It‚Äôs nice plan. Let‚Äôs examine it. 
The new technocratic media is based on profiling users. There is no impactful news unless each member of the audience is surveilled and analyzed on the basis of what he already likes and wants. 
Shocking? It‚Äôs to be expected. How else would technocrats parlay the untold hours they‚Äôve spent sizing up their consumers/users? 
Several years ago, I wrote: ‚ÄúTech blather has already begun, since Jeff Bezos, CEO of Amazon, bought the Washington Post at a fire sale. Jeff Genius will invent new ways to transmit the news to ‚Äòpeople on the go‚Äô and make the Post a smashing success. Mobile devices. Multiple platforms. Digital taking over from print. Ads customized to fit readers‚Äô interests (profiling). News stories customized to fit readers‚Äô interests (more profiling).‚Äù 
In other words, non-news. If you thought media were irrelevant and deceptive before, you haven‚Äôt seen anything. The ‚Äúnew news‚Äù will create millions of virtual bubbles in which profiled users can float contentedly, under the cozy cottage roofs of their favorite little separate paradigms. 
The tech giant Apple has waded into this territory with an app that will deliver news to users. Yahoo: ‚ÄúApple News, part of the upcoming iOS 9 operating system, aims to be the primary news source for users of the iPhone and iPad‚Ä¶ Apple says its news app ‚Äòfollows over a million topics and pulls relevant stories based on your specific interests‚Äô‚Ä¶ Joshua Benton of the Nieman Journalism Lab said the app will be important because ‚Äòthrough the awesome power of default, Apple distribution puts it in an entirely other league. This [news] app will be on hundreds of millions of devices within 24 hours of its debut‚Äô.‚Äù 
Translation: Profiling their users down to their toenails, Apple will present them with virtual bubbles of news they want to see and read. 
Not just one overall presentation for all; no, different ‚Äúnews outlets‚Äù for Apple‚Äôs audiences. 
This introduces a whole new layer of mind control. 
‚ÄúYou‚Äôre an Obama fan? Here are stories confirming your belief in the Prophet.‚Äù 
‚ÄúYou want neo-con on the rocks with a conservative Republican twist? Here‚Äôs some war footage that‚Äôll warm your heart.‚Äù 
‚ÄúDo you believe ‚Äògovernment gridlock‚Äô is our biggest concern? Congress can‚Äôt get anything done? We‚Äôve got headlines for that from here to the moon.‚Äù 
‚ÄúTuned into celeb gossip? Here‚Äôs your world in three minutes.‚Äù 
The idea: convince users, one day at a time, that what they already believe is important IS the news of the day. 
It‚Äôs Decentralized Centralization. One media giant carving its global audience up into little pieces and delivering them a whole host of different algorithmically appropriate lies and fluff and no-context psyops. 
And for ‚Äúfringe users?‚Äù ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre doubtful about GMOs? Well, look at what Whole Foods is planning for their healthier produce section. Cheer up.‚Äù Nothing about Maui voters declaring a temporary ban on devastatingly toxic Monsanto/Dow experiments or the dangers of Roundup. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre anti-vaccine? Sorry, you don‚Äôt count. You‚Äôre not a recognized demographic. But here‚Äôs a piece about a little unvaccinated boy who was involved in car crash on the I5.‚Äù 
Does this sound like science fiction? It isn‚Äôt. It‚Äôs the mainstream look of the near-future. Search engines are already ‚Äúpersonalizing‚Äù your inquiries. US ABC national news is climbing in the ratings because it‚Äôs giving viewers ‚Äúlighter stories,‚Äù and spending less time on thorny issues like the Middle East. 
The mainstream news business is desperately looking for audience; and treating every ‚Äúuser‚Äù as a profiled social-construct-bundle of superficial preferences is their answer. 
‚ÄúMr. X, we‚Äôve studied the little virtual bubble you live in, and now we can sell you your own special brand of truth.‚Äù 
‚ÄúHello, audience. We‚Äôre going to pitch you on becoming full-fledged obsessed consumers, as if there is no other worthy goal in life‚Äîand then we‚Äôre going to profile you from top to bottom, to find out exactly what kind of obsessed consumer you are, so we can hit you and trigger you with information that uniquely stimulates your adrenal glands‚Ä¶‚Äù 
The one-two punch. 
Any actual event occurring in the world will be pre-digested by robot media editors and profilers, and then split up into variously programmed bits of information for different audiences. 
Who cares what really happened? In the new world, there is no ‚Äòwhat really happened‚Äô. That‚Äôs a gross misnomer. A faulty idea. A metaphysical error. No, there is only a multi-forked media tongue that simultaneously spits out a dozen or a hundred variations of the same event‚Ä¶because different viewers want and expect different realities. 
In 1984 , Orwell‚Äôs Big Brother was issuing a single voice into the homes of the population. That was old-school. That was primitive technology. That was achieving unity by hammering unity into people‚Äôs skulls. This, now, is the frontier of unity through diversity. 
‚ÄúWe want to make all of you into androids, through basic PR and propaganda and a pathetic excuse for education. However, we recognize you‚Äôll become different varieties of androids, and we‚Äôll serve that outcome with technological sophistication. Trust us. We care about what you prefer.‚Äù 
User A: ‚ÄúWow, did you see the coverage of the border war in Chula Vista?‚Äù 
User B: ‚ÄúWar? They had a fantastic exhibit of drones down there. At least a hundred different types. And then I watched an old WW2 movie about aerial combat.‚Äù 
User C: ‚ÄúChula Vista? They had a great food show. This woman made a lemon pie. I could practically taste it.‚Äù 
User D: ‚ÄúThat wasn‚Äôt a border war. It was a drill. And then afterwards, these cops gave a demonstration of all their gear. Vests, shields, communication devices, flash-bangs, auto rifles with silencers, batons. I watch drills all over the country. Love them.‚Äù 
User E: ‚ÄúChula Vista? The only thing I saw on the news was ‚Äòsunny and mild‚Äô this week. I watch all the weather channels. I love them.‚Äù 
BUT when a Big One comes along, like the 2016 national election in the US, the separate tunes come together and ring as one. Then the overriding need to extend Globalism‚Äôs goals (in the person of Hillary Clinton) blot out every other priority. Then the major media twist whatever they need to twist. Then it‚Äôs the same bubble for everyone. 
One problem, though. Major media have been lanced thousands of times by alt news sites, and by WikiLeaks and Project Veritas. This attack has exposed the truth and the Clinton crimes. 
And alt news reflects the growing interest of the public in what‚Äôs actually happening on many fronts. 
The technocratic plan for the news is failing. 
It was a nice plan, but‚Ä¶ 
It‚Äôs turning out to be a dud. 
Alt media are forcing public awareness of one giant scandal after another: Hillary/Obama support for ISIS; pro-vaccine liars; the collapse of Obamacare; the GMO hustle; pesticide damage‚Ä¶on and on and on. 
The result? Major media are being backed into a corner, where they must defend lies and build monolithic lies for EVERYONE all the time. The idea of creating separate news for each profiled user is collapsing. 
Major media are playing defense against the rest of the world. 
It‚Äôs quite a party. 
And it has no expiration date. 
A final note: Trump, WikiLeaks, Project Veritas, Drudge, and many alt news sites created a perfect storm in 2016, raining down on major media. It was and is unprecedented. The mainstream press has been exposed down to its roots, as never before. The lying, the collusion, the arrogant sense of entitlement, the desperation, the corruption‚Äîit‚Äôs all there to see, for anyone who has eyes and a few working brain cells. Expect more to come, regardless of the outcome of the election. The train has really left the station‚Ä¶

Someone Just Donated $2.5 Million to Bail Out Everyone Arrested at Standing Rock,"By Nick Bernabe 
Following the recent mass arrests of 141 people at the Dakota Access Pipeline construction site located near Standing Rock, North Dakota, an anonymous donor just donated $2.5 million to bail out everyone who was arrested at the protests. 
The news came after Tamara Francis-Fourkiller, a tribal leader from the Caddo Nation tribe in Caddo County, Oklahoma, was arrested at Standing Rock. Francis-Fourkiller was released after spending two days in jail, but her family says she was just an innocent observer in the clashes between militarized law enforcement and Native American activists, or ‚Äúwater protectors.‚Äù 
[ UPDATE 11/1 4:35 pm EST: A statement from Red Owl Legal Collective/National Lawyers Guild that is advising Standing Rock has issued a statement saying the $2.5 million has not been received yet. We are waiting on confirmation from the Caddo Nation tribe.] 
According to local news affiliate News On 6 : 
Family members of Caddo Nation chairwoman Tamara Francis-Fourkiller said an anonymous donor paid $2.5 million late Saturday afternoon to release everyone arrested on Thursday at the Dakota Access Pipeline site. They said, however, that Francis-Fourkiller should not have been arrested in the first place. 
Though the donor who sent the $2.5 million remains anonymous, it appears the person is connected to the Caddo Nation tribe in some way .",1

Smart Meter Case Testimony Before the Pennsylvania Public Utility Commission: What No One Wants to Acknowledge About EMF Damage,"By Catherine J. Frompovich 
Part 1 of 4 
The following is the testimony I will present pro se [without a lawyer representing me] to the Pennsylvania Public Utility Commission‚Äôs Administrative Law Court, November 2 and 3, 2016 as a result of my not permitting an AMI Smart Meter to be retrofitted on to my electric service by PECO, an Exelon Company that provides electricity and service to the suburban Philadelphia where I live. 
This testimony addresses most of the health, legal, and constitutional issues, plus the politics involved regarding the unsafe and RF/EMF cancer-causing technology forced on consumers, along with threats of no electric service if utility customers refuse an AMI Smart Meter. 
There are four parts to the entire testimony that was 18 pages long plus 195 pages of Exhibits A-1 thru W, and other documentation I had in my brief case (not presented but as backup, if needed) that totaled in excess of three to four hundred pages of scientific documentation, published research, etc. 
Personally, I think after reading the entire testimony, which will appear in four parts, readers can understand what‚Äôs involved with unsafe, fire-prone, and RF/EMF/dirty electricity-producing AMI Smart Meters when for decades utilities provided safe, non-plastic parts analog meters. Before the Administrative Law Court at the PA Public Utility Commission Philadelphia, PA ‚Äì November 2 & 3, 2016 
Your Honor, Judge Heep and Judge Pell, Members of the PA PUC, PECO Energy Company, the Exelon legal team, and all interested parties: 
Since today is the rescheduled postponed June 27, 2016 hearing and for which I, Catherine J Frompovich, submitted written testimony five days in advance of that previous hearing as per court rules, I have decided to revise and include additional testimony interspersed into the previous 75 pages (10 pages of testimony and 65 pages of Exhibits A thru Q) that I submitted via the U.S. Postal Service and which all parties received, I presume. 
However, in view of the paramount importance, plus dire consequences, of EMFs/RFs being forced onto Pennsylvania consumers with no opt-out for personal safety and protection from 24/7/365 non-ionizing radiation emitted by AMI Smart Meters microwave technology, and my being a five-year breast cancer survivor, I submit into testimony and evidence that the PA PUC and all participating Pennsylvania utilities, not just PECO as in my case, must factor in the American with Disabilities Act Amendments, which redefine cancer as a disability, especially since there are cancer-causing effects from EMFs/RFs about which I submit into the record hundreds of documented scientific evidence as dozens of Exhibits per the Schedule of Exhibits I now introduce, plus printed documents I have with me in support of the four-page Bibliography of Pertinent Published Literature Regarding Electromagnetic Radiation, Cancer & AMI Smart Meters that I also submit into the record as Exhibit S . 
Since the ADA Amendments Act provides for three ‚Äúprongs‚Äù of what constitutes a disability, I am submitting into evidence a printout titled ‚ÄúAmericans with Disability Act Amendments Act (ADAAA)‚Äù pointing out appropriate and applicable sections Exhibit A-1 ; a two-page printout titled ‚ÄúADA Amendments redefine cancer as a disability‚Äù Exhibit A-2 ; along with a 43-page dossier containing about 240 published studies regarding BREAST and Other Cancers and EMF/ELF/RF Cancer Studies Exhibit A-3 ; and topping off those documents with a two-page letter dated 2 August 2016 from the foremost EMF/RF researchers, physicians and academics in the WORLD written to the North Carolina Utilities Commission Exhibit A-4 wherein in the third paragraph they state: 
Smart meters and cell phones occupy similar frequency bands of the electromagnetic spectrum, meaning that cell phone research can apply to smart meter RFR. Smart meter RFR consists of frequent, very intense but very brief pulses throughout the day. Because smart meter exposure over a 24 hour period can be very prolonged ( pulses can average 9,600 times a day ), and because there is building evidence that the sharp, high intensity pulses are particularly harmful , the cell phone study findings are applicable when discussing adverse health impacts from smart meters. 
Those five researchers, David Carpenter, MD, Director, Institute for Health and the Environment, University of Albany Dr Lennart Hardell, MD, PhD, Professor, Department of Oncology, University Hospital Orebro, Sweden Dr Magda Havas, BSC, PhD, Environmental & Resources Studies. Trent University, Canada Dr Martha Herbert, MD, PhD, Assistant Professor of Neurology, Harvard Medical School, Pediatric Neurologist and Neuroscientist at the Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston Dr Sam Milham, MD, MPH, Former chief epidemiologist, Washington State Department of Health 
point out in the last sentence of the first paragraph, ‚Äú‚Ä¶ it is imperative that the North Carolina Utilities Commission be fully aware of the harm that RFR can cause and allow utility customers to opt out of smart meter installation with no penalty.‚Äù 
Frompovich respectfully points out, and also cautions the PA PUC, that in not permitting opt outs from AMI Smart Meters in Pennsylvania during formulating its AMI SM regulations, since HB2200 stated AMI SMs were NOT to be mandated , it has breached ethical and legal standards regarding unsafe AMI SMs regarding the RFRs they emit. Various states have permitted safe electric power usage by granting and implementing AMI SMs opt outs, which the PA PUC deliberately refused in formulating its utility regulations regarding AMI SMs thereby subjecting consumers to unknown adverse health effects which, in essence, violate the Nuremberg Code since consumers‚Äô consent was not required nor asked, and their use apparently amounts to an experiment on PECO‚Äôs customers. 
Again, Frompovich points to the letter addressed to the NCUC Exhibit A-4 at the end of the second paragraph wherein those researchers cite the U.S. NTP June 2016 study Conclusion in part stating ‚Äú‚Ä¶adds proof to the conclusions from the human health studies that radiofrequency radiation increases risk of cancer .‚Äù 
Frompovich further elaborates that cell phone RFR exposure is elective , i.e., depending upon personal choice, use, and an individual‚Äôs ability to turn off cell phones, thereby reducing and/or avoiding similar frequency microwave bands and RFRs exposures both cell phones and AMI SMs produce. 
However, harmful personal bodily RFR exposure has been mandated by PA PUC Regulations‚Äînot HB2200/Act 129 (2008) and, therefore, is absolutely illegal, since Act 129 does not defy nor negate the Pennsylvania state constitution‚Äôs ‚ÄúInherent Rights of Mankind, Section 1‚Äù, but it‚Äôs the Commonwealth‚Äôs regulatory agency‚Äîthe PA PUC‚Äîthat is guilty of nonfulfillment, I allege: 
All men [and women] are born equally free and independent, and have certain inherent and indefeasible rights, among which are those of enjoying and defending life and liberty, of acquiring, possessing and protecting property and reputation , and of pursuing their own happiness. ‚Ä¶ Pennsylvania Constitution, Section 1. 
However, contrary to that Pennsylvania constitutional right is the fact that mandated AMI Smart Meter RFR exposure, because of no opt outs in Pennsylvania specifically via PA PUC Regulations not Act 129, literally provides no way to escape and/or avoid AMI SMs microwave RFRs. That is illegal and should be prosecuted criminally, Frompovich contends. Furthermore, the PA PUC overstepped its agency powers and, Frompovich contends, is guilty of committing ultra vires during its rulemaking process. 
The above five researchers Exhibit A-4 delineate cell phone and Smart Meters as basically the same ‚Äúanimal‚Äù because both occupy similar frequency bands on the electromagnetic spectrum! See paragraph 3 of their letter to the NCUC for more detail, including that Smart Meters over a 24-hour period can average 9,600 pulses a day causing high intensity pulses known as ‚Äúdirty electricity .‚Äù 
I submit into the record Exhibit A-5 Dirty Electricity or Dirty Power and the 10-page report ‚ÄúWhy Are Electromagnetic Fields Dangerous? ‚Äì Is Dirty Electricity Making You Sick?‚Äù including 2 charts [ Table 1 Ranking Electric Meters and Table 2 Ranking Electric Meters for Risk of Privacy and Cyber Security] from the 20-page report ‚ÄúRanking Electricity Meters for Risk to Health, Privacy, and Cyber Security,‚Äù available online at https://www.scribd.com/doc/289782183/Ranking-Electricity-Meters-for-Risk-to-Health-Privacy-and-Cyber-Security . 
The KEY dispute and multi-faceted issue of concern in Frompovich‚Äôs case ‚Äì being a breast cancer survivor in excess of five years ‚Äì is her free and legal exercise of legal and constitutional rights to be free of the fear, exposure to cancer-causing EMFs, and/or actuality of contracting cancer due to AMI SM RFR exposures 24/7/365 in her home‚Äîsomething that the ADA Amendments Act indisputably encompass, since once a cancer patient that makes Frompovich covered within one of the ADAAA prongs for all time, and also includes Frompovich‚Äôs indefeasible right to protect property‚Äî both her home and her personal body and its life processes ‚Äîincluding her reputation. 
That federal ADAAA must be factored into Frompovich‚Äôs case since PECO has obtained federal grant monies to implement its AMI Smart Meters rollout, and the law states that any business that accepts federal grant money is mandated to abide by the ADAAA, including state regulatory agencies like the PA PUC. 
Frompovich‚Äôs refusal of an AMI SM, plus her human and innate right to protect her health, body and property, are more than confirmed when those five researchers point out ‚Äú‚Ä¶ the strongest evidence for hazards coming from RFR is cancer , there is a growing body of evidence that some people develop a condition called electrohypersensitivity (EHS).‚Äù See paragraph 4 of the letter to NCUC Exhibit A-4 . 
On page 2, paragraph 1 of that same letter, the researchers further point out a dichotomy in science, which is the very fact that independent research versus industry research studies are at coincidental, if not predictable , variances, as per the chart I raise up and submit into the record , a double-sided poster ‚ÄúRadiofrequency Research: Does Funding Matter,‚Äù which shows two pie charts depicting those conflicting statistics. 
Non-industry studies indicate 70% harmful effects with 30% no effects, while industry studies indicate 32 % harmful effects with 68% no effects! Statistically, that‚Äôs almost a wash, as each just about cancels the other, however, there‚Äôs a slight edge of 2% from non-industry studies indicating harmful effects. More interestingly, though, is that industry studies DID find 32% harmful effects studies‚Äîalmost one-third of the studies and, yet, the industry concludes differently stating there are none! That alone should be a red flag for them, or anyone of scientific mind, to investigate further and they did not, which indicates some sort of collusion of not wanting to know or find out. Is that a crime of omission or collusion? 
Paragraph 2 on page 2 of that letter Exhibit A-4 cites the obvious CRUX of scientific and ethical issues regarding AMI Smart Meters in Pennsylvania, in particular, stating ‚ÄúWith a leading [NC] DHHS staff member admitting that he is not qualified to review the literature, and the fact that he relied on industry representatives for assistance, the DHHS conclusion is not surprising.‚Äù 
Frompovich feels compelled to question how much of that microwave technology industry representative assistance occurred, and still occurs, with and from PECO and the PA PUC, thereby illegally depriving Frompovich and all Pennsylvanians of their rights to protect their health and property, along with the exercise of redress against what amounts to experimental AMI Smart Meter science whose proponents wantonly do not recognize non-thermal adverse health effects from RFRs, which have been known since 1932! I introduce Exhibit T Electrosensitivity (ES) and Electromagnetic Hyper-sensitivity (EHS) into the record to document that in 1962, 1979, 2009 and 2015 various health issues have been identified with EMF non-thermal exposures. 
Your Honors, I respectfully ask the court to instruct PECO to produce the experimental studies, rather than epidemiological studies, indicating no non-thermal effects from EMFs/RFs. Where‚Äôs the science? 
Aren‚Äôt PECO‚Äôs customers entitled to have that evidence? 
Frompovich also feels compelled to ask this court the following: How much influence did the microwave industry contribute to PA State Representative Robert Godshall‚Äôs campaign coffers and/or his preferred charities that apparently has enabled Godshall, as Chair of the PA House Consumer Affairs Committee, to sit on opt out bills in the PA legislature for several legislative sessions, including Godshall‚Äôs verbal proclamations to others that he will never bring opt out bills to the floor for a vote, which obviously is an impeachable offence for depriving Pennsylvanians of their right to redress government and government agency oppressions that enable utility companies to harass and bully customers about cutting off electric service if they refuse fire-prone AMI SMs in Pennsylvania. 
Here‚Äôs what other U.S. states have done regarding AMI Smart Meters: 
Analog meters are definitively offered as the opt-out meter in four states: Arizona, California, Maine, and Texas. The Nevada public service commission urges the utilities to provide the meter that will have the ‚Äúgreatest customer acceptance,‚Äù which, clearly, is the analog. 
Three states offer the ‚Äúexisting meter‚Äù as the opt-out meter. An existing meter might or might not be analog. Georgia, Hawaii, and Consumers Energy in Michigan. 
Three states let the utility decide: Florida, Maryland, and Nevada. The Nevada public service commission urges the utilities to provide the meter that will have the ‚Äúgreatest customer acceptance,‚Äù which, clearly, is the analog. 
Four states or utilities definitively forbid analog opt-outs: Fountain in Colorado, DTE in Michigan, Central Hudson Valley in New York (AMR), and Port Angeles in Washington (touted as the first place to ban smart meters‚Äînot much help you are required to have a digital meter on your home!). 
Two states/districts require smart meters: Pennsylvania and Washington, DC.

Smart Meter Case Testimony Before the Pennsylvania Public Utility Commission: What No One Wants to Acknowledge About EMF Damage (Part 2 of 4),"By Catherine J. Frompovich 
This is the continuation of the testimony I will present before the Pennsylvania Public Utility Commission‚Äôs Administrative Law Court November 2 and 3, 2016. 
Currently, Chairman Representative Godshall is allowing three more opt out bills to become sine die this session, which should amount to an impeachable offense for denying consumers their inherent and indefeasible rights, especially of redress to government, and also according to the Pennsylvania Constitution, I contend. 
Probably nothing encapsulates and explains the EMF/RFR controversy or conundrum, if you may, from a scientific viewpoint than the 35-page report ‚Äú EUROPAEM EMF Guideline 2016 for the prevention, diagnosis and treatment of EMF-related health problems and illnesses ,‚Äù which is a Spanish language document and found online at https://listas.um.es/sympa/arc/anuncios/2016-07/msg00069.html This report cites 308 published scientific references, which leaves Frompovich to question why the PA PUC‚Äîand PECO in particular‚Äîare so daft in proffering that there is no updated science other than the 1940s era ‚Äòsafety‚Äô THERMAL science regarding microwave electromagnetic energies based in ‚Äòancient‚Äô radar studies the microwave industry always trots out as proof of ‚Äòsafety‚Äô. 
Those ‚Äòsafety‚Äô studies originated in Germany during World War II; are totally outmoded; but remain the present Federal Communications Commission‚Äôs rules regarding safety of cell phones and AMI Smart Meters. It is now 2016! How come 1940s microwave technology science is being applied as the ‚Äògold standard‚Äô or ‚Äòscientific criterion‚Äô to meters that will become the key intelligence gathering technology for the Internet of Things? Frompovich has to question the credibility factor of both PECO and the PA PUC for depending upon 1940 science in today‚Äôs technology world of 2016. Where‚Äôs the science later than the 1940s? Please, may I have those studies PECO supplied to the PA PUC? 
Frompovich, therefore, respectfully suggests that the PA PUC study the above-aforementioned European reports with medical and EHS health professionals, who are qualified to explain the diagnostics and varied modalities discussed, in order to issue updated regulations affecting AMI Smart Meters and their continuous RFR/EMF health-damaging electromagnetics, plus their fire-and-explosion-prone proclivities and occurrences, which definitely was not the case for all the decades utilities used safe and efficient analog meters. 
Children are the most vulnerable to EMF radiation and, therefore, I introduce Exhibit U-1 ‚ÄúWhy children absorb more microwave radiation than adults: The Consequences,‚Äù and Exhibit U-2 ‚ÄúAmerican Academy of Pediatrics August 29, 2013 letter urging the Food and Drug Administration Commissioner, the Federal Communications Commission and others to advise the public about Specific Absorption Rates (SARs) regarding EMF/RF exposures.‚Äù 
Also, I want to apprise every one of the fact that electromagnetic sensitivity (EHS) is a growing problem and according to recently reported statistics in the peer reviewed journal ECOPSYCHOLOGY, Professor Pamela Reed Gibson states the following: 26% of the USA population; 19% of the Swedish population; 27% of the Danish population; and 32 % of the German population are EHS compromised. See Exhibit V . However, other sources claim that as much as 5% of the entire world‚Äôs population is affected. 
Just as chemical sensitivities were discredited and denied by medical doctors for years‚Äînow referred to as ‚Äúsick building syndrome‚Äù or ‚ÄúMultiple Chemical Sensitivity (MCS)‚Äîso, too, is EHS now being recognized by many, including the World Health Organization. I introduce Exhibit W ‚ÄúElectrohypersensitivity: a functional impairment due to an inaccessible environment.‚Äù Printout available here https://docs.google.com/viewer?a=v&pid=forums&srcid=MDgxODkwOTk5NjU5OTU4ODQwNTYBMTU3NTIzMDA1MTQxNTY1NzI0NTcBTVRzdGFEOUNBUUFKATAuMQEBdjI 
As Exhibit X I introduce a study no one can refute, ‚ÄúA review on Electromagnetic fields (EMFs) and the reproductive system,‚Äù which outlines science the microwave industry, PECO and all utilities utilizing AMI Smart Meters, plus public utility commissions across the USA need to factor into the inevitable legal liability that they are assuming by committing crimes against humanity by exposing the population to unsafe microwave electromagnetics 24/7/365 from dirty electricity pulsed by AMI SMs onto home wiring and into private residences and all buildings retrofitted with AMI Smart Meters. 
Before I include my previously submitted testimony, I find it necessary to impress upon the court that it should not be Frompovich‚Äôs obligation to prove the medical consequences beyond a reasonable doubt, especially in light of the ADA Amendments Act as it applies to those receiving federal funding or even that the consequences of medical problems are more probable than not, since the ADAAA provides Frompovich with disability rights and protections, which PECO and the PA PUC must abide by. 
Furthermore, it should be the indisputable duty of PECO and all Pennsylvania utility companies ‚Äì but more specifically that of the PA Public Utility Commission‚Äôs stated mission for being ‚Äì to provide safe and non-radiating innovations in utility technology and appliances with 100% certainty, which AMI Smart Meters fail on numerous levels, especially with their proclivity for ‚Äúhot sockets,‚Äù fires and explosions, EMF/RF constant emissions and dirty electricity pulses as frequent as 9600 times a day! 
No medical-scientific testing has proved AMI Smart Meters EMFs safety regarding non-thermal adverse health effects that I know of. Where‚Äôs the science? 
Therefore, Frompovich should not be forced to allow a proven-fire-prone AMI Smart Meter electric service on her property that would radiate dirty electricity into her residence with high RFR pulses every fifteen seconds. 
Just to add more ‚Äúsalt to the wound,‚Äù as they would say, there are no assurances that monitoring is not part and parcel of the AMI Smart Meter agenda and an integral surveillance device of the Internet of Things, or that information will be shared with unknown third parties‚Äîfor whatever reasons‚Äîand for which Frompovich does not approve nor give her permission to PECO, the PA PUC or any government agencies or agents. 
Therefore, Frompovich feels her privacy, as well as her home and personal physiology, will be subjected to unlawful, unconstitutional and unnecessary interventions at various levels and, specifically, without proper legal processes, e.g., court-issued warrants, in order to surveil her home that automatically will occur from the two-way ZigBee radio transmitter system of AMI SMs and all ‚Äúsmart‚Äù appliances which are built to interact with the coming surveillance technology of the Internet of Things. The times Frompovich makes tea in the morning and shuts off her lights for the night are no one‚Äôs business but her own. 
I‚Äôve been researching consumer health issues and whatsoever affects human health negatively , including technologies, since the late 1970s. During my career, I was considered an expert witness providing testimony before several states‚Äô legislature/legislative hearings on health issues. For numerous years I was ahead of both the popular curve and the allopathic paradigm of medicine regarding the role of diet, nutrition, epigenetics, and lifestyle issues in maintaining optimum health, avoiding disease and regaining health utilizing holistic health principles. 
I am in my 78 th year, thank God. Since the early 1970s, when I almost lost my life due to unfortunate medical mistakes and had to remove myself from mainstream allopathic care in order to save my life, I‚Äôve been immersed in what‚Äôs called the ‚Äúholistic lifestyle.‚Äù I‚Äôve beaten the odds, including being a breast cancer survivor, using holistic healthcare modalities. For the record, 38.3% of U.S. adults and 11.8% of U.S. children used what‚Äôs referred to as CAM in 2007 per NIH statistics[1]. Complementary and Alternative Medicine‚ÄîCAM as it‚Äôs called, is popular throughout the world, while in the U.S. there is the National Center for Complementary and Integrative Health at the National Institutes of Health. 
However, the allopathic paradigm considers it, quite frankly, a pain in its professional butt since CAM has become the ‚Äúgo to‚Äù healthcare system when allopathy fails one. 
Therefore, I expect that I probably will educate misinformed individuals on the negative health consequences of electromagnetic frequencies from microwave energy producing technologies like cell phones and towers, Wi-Fi, ‚Äòsmart‚Äô gadgets, and, in particular, AMI Smart Meters, which are being bully-forced onto electric, natural gas, and municipal water utility customers. Most state legislators, the media and the public are undeniably ignorant of the damage being done to their health. Fortunately, I am not one of those people, thus my refusing an AMI Smart Meter on my house. But, first I think you ought to know some of my background: I‚Äôm a well-informed, plus over 40 years published consumer health researcher, advocate-activist, journalist, and author. 
That I should be taken seriously, I offer some of my professional background: retired practicing natural nutritionist; former registered lobbyist with the U.S. Congress for five years representing holistic healthcare issues; executive director for the national Coalition for Alternatives in Nutrition And Healthcare (CANAH) for five years and, as such, presented FDA-solicited expertise input regarding holistic health practices for its 1990 OTA report OTA-H-405 NTIS #PB91-104893[2] ‚ÄúUnconventional Cancer Treatments‚Äù [3]; expert nutrition witness before a congressional subcommittee opposing food irradiation; government relations specialist for a consortium of natural nutrition supplement makers before the U.S. Food and Drug Administration; the first Government Relations specialist for the Life Extension Foundation, who set up LEF‚Äôs government relations department; a published journalist; author of numerous books regarding health and lifestyle issues with several books available on Amazon.com and my 2016 book, Eat to Beat Disease, Foods Medicinal Qualities. 
Additionally, I wrote and produced two TV shows. One called, ‚Äú Turn Off the Violence ‚Äù was nominated for a Telly Award. That hour-long show was instrumental in securing the Giraffe Award given to persons, who stick out their necks for the common good. The recipient was George Mason University staff member Connie Kirkland[4], who founded a 24-hour crisis center for rape victims and promoted on-campus non-violence educational campaigns specifically relating to rape and domestic violence. What I‚Äôve shared is much less than half of my background. More would take too much of your time. However, I feel compelled to ask, ‚ÄúHow many people can match my qualifications to discuss consumer health issues?‚Äù 
Furthermore, I want to underscore upfront that IF I were a habitual drug addict, rather than an informed, concerned health-conscious researcher and consumer being harassed for trying to protect and preserve my health, I probably would be welcomed with open arms, plus there would be all types of programs and subsidies available for help. Because I am opposing faulty and health-damaging RF/EMF ‚Äòscience‚Äô, plus vested-interest snooping, surveillance, and customer data marketing agendas using AMI smart meters, I am harassed and even threatened with termination of electric service even though all my bills are paid in full. That leaves me with no options but to dutifully invoke and defend my state and federal constitutional rights to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. Isn‚Äôt there something radically wrong with such a construct, especially in the USA, if I have to do that? 
Attorney Ward Smith‚Äôs interrogatory requesting Frompovich‚Äôs cancer health records, quite frankly, leaves everyone with whom I‚Äôve shared that fact, totally aghast and amazed! Why? Because Frompovich‚Äôs medical records are her personal information protected under HIPPA and I must protect them. Furthermore, since the PUC Administrative Law Court hearing is of public record, Frompovich does not want her personal medical records made public information during any level in these proceedings, as that is her fundamental right. 
I respectfully bring to this court‚Äôs attention that my breast cancer and medical records are NOT the issue. What‚Äôs the issue, problem, and at stake not only for me, but for all Pennsylvanians, is the total callous disregard by utility companies‚ÄîPECO included, the PA PUC, and the Commonwealth for health hazards, safety, and the wellbeing of all Pennsylvanians, especially those with health issues, compromised immune systems, disabilities, and especially young, growing children‚Äîfetuses in particular‚Äîwhom RF/EMF and dirty electricity produced by AMI Smart Meters affect and impact negatively. 
Before presenting into the record additional reams of recent research with documentation and annotations‚Äînot 1940s vintage radar safety research‚Äîfor RFs/EMFs and microwave electromagnetic energies impacts upon cancer and health, I feel it necessary to introduce something no one probably has thought about nor factored into the AMI Smart Meter hidden costs continuum , and that is, healthcare services and ancillary costs stemming from non-ionizing radiation RFs/EMFs Smart Meters impact upon human tissue. 
There are mounting underlying, long-term adverse health effects accruing as we speak from PA PUC-PECO forced AMI Smart Meter 24/7/365 RF/EMF electromagnetics, pulses, harmonics and dirty electricity, specifically adverse Non-thermal health effects, impacting children and an ageing PA population, which will generate dire fiscal consequences, plus responsibilities, upon Penna. Medicaid health cost line items in each year‚Äôs operating budget for the Commonwealth. 
To cement that forewarning, I offer the World Health Organization‚Äôs statistic, ‚ÄúApproximately 10% of reported cases of EHS [electromagnetic hypersensitivity] were considered severe,‚Äù which means specialized caregiving. That, however, does not include cancer-induced health issues from RFs/EMFs! What kind of budget shortfall will AMI Smart Meters adverse health effects eventually generate for PA‚Äôs legislature and governor to haggle about, when we‚Äôve seen what‚Äôs been going on recently to get a state budget passed? Has anyone thought about that very real problem?

False Flag? US Intelligence Warns Of Likely Al Qaeda Terror Attack Day Before Election,"By Whitney Webb 
Over the course of this year‚Äôs US presidential election, which has been nothing if not bizarre, some have repeatedly speculated that the election may not actually happen at all if an opportunely timed terrorist attack or other major event occurred at just the right moment, leading to a suspension of the November election. Now, these theories appear to have more credence as sources within US intelligence have contacted Pat Milton, a CBS News senior investigative producer, warning him that terrorist attacks in three US states are highly likely come this Monday, the day before the US election. US Intelligence has allegedly alerted joint terrorism task forces that al Qaeda, not ISIS, could be planning attacks in New York, Texas, and Virginia. No specific locations within those three states were mentioned. 
US authorities are said to be taking the threat seriously, though CBS News ‚Äô sources stress that the threat is still being assessed and its credibility has yet to be confirmed. According to CBS , counter-terrorism officials were alerted to the threat out of an ‚Äúabundance of caution.‚Äù 
Earlier this week, there were also warnings that ‚Äúpolling places‚Äù could be seen as ‚Äúattractive targets‚Äù for ‚Äúlone wolf‚Äù attackers by individuals motivated by ‚Äúviolent extremist ideologies, sovereign citizen or other extremist activity.‚Äù This has led federal law enforcement to plan for several worst-case scenarios. One FBI official told CBS : 
The counter-terrorism and homeland security communities remain vigilant and well-postured to defend against attacks here in the United States. The FBI, working with our federal, state and local counterparts, shares and assesses intelligence on a daily basis and will continue to work closely with law enforcement and intelligence community partners to identify and disrupt any potential threat to public safety. 
However, what‚Äôs interesting here is that the terror threat is coming from al Qaeda as opposed to the Islamic State. In the Syrian ‚Äúcivil‚Äù war, the US has been actively helping al Qaeda there, grouping their Syrian branch ‚Äì the al Nusra Front ‚Äì in with the ‚Äúmoderate rebels‚Äù they support. Therefore, al Qaeda‚Äôs ability to launch attacks within the US has been directly aided by US intelligence, making this announcement incredibly suspect. 
It‚Äôs also worth pointing out that al Qaeda, since its inception, has been a product of the US intelligence community. In the 1980s they were essentially created by the US to fight the Soviets in Afghanistan. Ever since, they have conveniently been used as the justification for an expansion of US wars abroad and the elimination of civil liberties domestically. 
It is also interesting that the threat is al Qaeda and NOT the Islamic State. The Islamic State has been the terrorist ‚Äúbogeyman‚Äù of recent years and their involvement in any threat, real or imagined, is useful justification for escalating US involvement in Syria. It seems highly likely that the Islamic State was left out due to recent revelations from WikiLeaks showing that their funding comes from the very same entities that donate millions to the Clinton Foundation. 
It is also worth noting that if a terrorist attack does come to pass, it will be a big help for Hillary. Hillary has been under siege in recent weeks due to WikiLeaks‚Äô near constant releases of her campaign chair‚Äôs emails, but also due to the FBI‚Äôs ‚Äúmutiny‚Äù which led them to re-open a probe into Clinton‚Äôs use of a private email server. Any terror attack would give Clinton the opportunity to gain political ground by promoting her aggressive foreign policy aims in Syria and the rest of the Middle East. 
However, as mentioned at the beginning of this article, it is also possible that a terrorist attack on US soil would give President Obama the authority to either postpone or outright cancel the election, something he could not normally do except in the event of extraordinary circumstances. Unfortunately, only time will tell which theory is correct, compelling us to stay vigilant in the meantime.

California Secessionists to Meet at Capitol Day After Presidential Election,"
By Joseph Jankowski 
An organization which has the aim to separate the state of California from the Union of the United States is set to hold a meeting at the state capitol in Sacramento on Wednesday, November 9, 2016, the day after the presidential election. 
The Yes California Independence Campaign , which is based in San Diego, describes itself as a ‚Äúnonviolent campaign to establish the country of California using any and all legal and constitutional means to do so.‚Äù 
The group is currently trying to qualify a citizen‚Äôs initiative in 2018 to get a referendum for secession on the ballot in 2019, reports SF Gate . They will be in Sacramento in hopes to gather support for the state‚Äôs exit, or the ‚ÄúCalexit,‚Äù as they call it. 
‚ÄúIn our view, the United States of America represents so many things that conflict with Californian values, and our continued statehood means California will continue subsidizing the other states to our own detriment, and to the detriment of our children,‚Äù reads Yes California ‚Äôs official website. 
The group‚Äôs page reads on: 
Although charity is part of our culture, when you consider that California‚Äôs infrastructure is falling apart, our public schools are ranked among the worst in the entire country, we have the highest number of homeless persons living without shelter and other basic necessities, poverty rates remain high, income inequality continues to expand, and we must often borrow money from the future to provide services for today, now is not the time for charity. However, this independence referendum is about more than California subsidizing other states of this country. It is about the right to self-determination and the concept of voluntary association, both of which are supported by constitutional and international law.
It is about California taking its place in the world, standing as an equal among nations. We believe in two fundamental truths: (1) California exerts a positive influence on the rest of the world, and (2) California could do more good as an independent country than it is able to do as a just a U.S. state. 
Yes California ‚Äôs website lays out 9 different points covering topics the group believes will benefit from a California exit from the US, including education, peace and security, debt and taxes and immigration. 
One blog post on their page draws parallels with a ‚ÄúCalexit‚Äù and the recent referendum known as ‚ÄúBrexit‚Äù that passed in the UK in June which showed that most British people are ready for their country to leave the EU. 
The push for secession is nothing new to California. In 1941 the mayor of Port Orford, Oregon, Gilbert Gable, proposed the idea to push the Oregon counties of Curry, Josephine, Jackson, and Klamath to join with the California counties of Del Norte, Siskiyou, and Modoc to form a new state, later named Jefferson. 
Modoc County of Northern California voted in 2013 to join neighboring Siskiyou County in a push to secede from the State of California . 
In 2014, two counties in northern California petitioned for the right to form a 51st State of America, which they also wanted to name Jefferson.

Leaked Memo: Clinton Foundation Broke The Law,"By Jon Rappoport 
Breaking: leaked 2008 memo from attorney Kumiki Gibson to Clinton Foundation chairman Bruce Lindsay. Gibson had been hired to do an independent assessment of the Foundation‚Äôs practices. 
Below are key quotes from Gibson‚Äôs findings. Keep in mind that the Clinton Foundation‚Äôs very existence depends on it being legally certified as a non-profit entity, in compliance with laws governing non-profits. Break those laws and its non-profit status would be revoked, and the whole operation would go down the drain. 
Gibson: ‚ÄúImportant responsibilities regarding corporate filings are delegated to the [Foundation] CFO, who appears to delegate them to an outside organization, with very little oversight by the legal department. As a result, the Foundation is not in compliance with the filings rules, including in New York, which requires the Foundation to be certified to do business in the State.‚Äù [Apparently, the Clinton Foundation was not legally registered as a non-profit in New York.] 
Gibson: ‚ÄúNo matter what the leadership decides about the larger, over-arching question, it must act immediately to bring the Foundation into compliance with the law and standards that govern not-for-profits, and must create strong legal and HR offices so to prevent any lapses in the future.‚Äù 
Gibson: ‚ÄúThe Foundation does not have a record retention policy[!], and the procedures currently utilized in Harlem [headquarters] may violate the law.‚Äù 
Zero Hedge writes: ‚ÄúFurthermore, and more troubling, the [Gibson] review pointed to a high-ranking but unnamed foundation executive who was ‚Äòbeing paid by [President Clinton], the government and the foundation‚Äô who ‚Äòallowed the foundation to host what may have been (or may have been viewed as) a political event, apparently without official pre-approval from the foundation‚Äôs legal department and without regard, before the fact, to the impact of that decision on the foundation‚Äôs tax exempt status.‚Äô‚Äù 
This memo was written in 2008. It would have taken then, and it would now take, about a month of investigation by New York State and US Dept. of Justice officials to nail down the particulars and sink the Clinton Foundation. 
That didn‚Äôt happen then. Will it happen now? Not if the Dept. of Justice has anything to say about it. The Clintons are protected. 
But evidence of the Foundation corruption is spreading like wildfire. Some fires are impossible to contain.

BUSTED: Trump Supporters Get Caught Creating Fake Badges To Intimidate Voters At Polling Places | Addicting Info | The Knowledge You Crave,"on October 27, 2016 2:53 am ¬∑ 
Conservatives claim that voter ID is necessary to catch illegal voters, but it turns out they‚Äôre the only ones creating fake IDs to use on Election Day. 
Trump supporters are taking Trump‚Äôs call to monitor polling places so seriously that they are creating fake ID badges in order to infiltrate polling locations across the country and intimidate voters by interrogating them, confusing them, and filming them ‚Äî all of which are illegal. 
But, Trump‚Äôs deplorables are doing this in droves with the help of a right-wing group known as ‚ÄúVote Protectors.‚Äù 
The group, which is affiliated with top Trump ally Roger Stone, is giving people the ability to intimidate voters on Election Day. They are literally teaching them to create their own fake badge, which is designed to give them access to voters both inside and outside the polling places where citizens cast their votes. 
According to the Huffington Post , 
Stone‚Äôs group created an official-looking ID badge for its volunteers to wear, and its volunteers planned to videotape voters and conduct fake ‚Äúexit polls,‚Äù efforts that election experts say risks intimidating and confusing voters. Or at least that‚Äôs what the group was planning to do before The Huffington Post asked Stone about it on Tuesday. The controversial Trump ally, long known for his bare-knuckled political tactics, said that key proposals on his group‚Äôs websites were there without his knowledge, and assured HuffPost that he would operate within the confines of election law. 
In fact, after HuffPo confronted Stone with evidence that these kinds of tactics were being pursued by the website, he acknowledged that Vote Protectors had a ‚Äúbad idea‚Äù and ‚Äúordered them taken down.‚Äù 
Campaign Legal Center deputy director Danielle Lang called the tactics a clear voter intimidation scheme. 
‚ÄúIt‚Äôs inherently intimidating and an invasion of privacy,‚Äù she told HuffPo in reference to the videotaping. ‚ÄúWhen that‚Äôs being live streamed to the internet, it amplifies the potentially intimidating aspect of it, and violates a sense of security and privacy people have a right to enjoy at the polls. Objectively, intimidating voters is unlawful, no matter where you do it.‚Äù 
Indeed, but that‚Äôs exactly what Donald Trump has been calling upon his supporters to do because he has repeatedly claimed that the election is rigged against him. 
As it turns out, he‚Äôs right about the election being rigged, only it‚Äôs conservatives who are trying to rig it in favor of Trump. 
Earlier this week, a Wisconsin city clerk in Green Bay got caught trying to intentionally prevent college students from voting by arguing in an email to the Wisconsin Ethics Commission that an extra polling place should not be opened near the University of Wisconsin-Green Bay because she has merely heard that students lean Democrat. 
‚ÄúI was reading the statutes and read: No site may be designated that affords an advantage to any political party,‚Äù Republican appointed clerk Kris Teske wrote. 
‚ÄúUWGB is a polling location for students and residents on Election Day but I feel by asking for this to be the site for early voting is encouraging the students to vote more than benefiting the city as a whole. I have heard it said that students lean more toward the democrats and he is a democrat. I have spoken with our Chief of Staff and others at City Hall and they agree that budget wise this isn‚Äôt going to happen. I would like to know your thoughts on this. Do I have an argument about it being more of a benefit to the democrats.‚Äù 
So not only are Trump supporters trying to rig the election with voter intimidation tactics using hypocritical methods, they are using voter suppression tactics as well. 
And that is likely going to cause a lot of Election Day chaos. Voters should be prepared to stand up for their right to vote no matter what Trump‚Äôs deplorables try to do to keep them from exercising it.

Kellyanne Conway LOSES IT On Jake Tapper When He Calls Out Trump‚Äôs Bigoted Fans (VIDEO),"on October 30, 2016 2:24 pm ¬∑ 
One thing that has continuously dogged the Donald Trump for president campaign is the fact that racists, anti-semites, xenophobes, misogynists, and various other bigots have stuck with the bombastic real estate mogul since he first launched his travesty of a campaign. No matter how much Trump‚Äôs people try to say he doesn‚Äôt want the support of such folks, the candidate himself refuses to take the fact that there is anything about the campaign he has been running that attracts these people seriously. So, naturally, when Trump‚Äôs campaign manager Kellyanne Conway sat down with an interview with CNN‚Äôs Jake Tapper on Sunday , that particular issue came up again. Of course, Conway was not happy. Tapper began: 
‚ÄúThere are a lot of anti-Semites and racists and misogynists who support the Trump candidacy.‚Äù 
Conway immediately went on defense, saying, ‚Äúwow.‚Äù Tapper went on to reference a man who was shouting ‚ÄòJEW-S-A‚Äô at the press pen at a recent Trump rally, and directly asked Conway if she would refer to such people as ‚Äòdeplorable.‚Äô She responded: 
‚ÄúYes, I would. Wow, I have to push back on some of the adjectives you just used to describe ‚Äî I hope you‚Äôve been to Trump rallies and I hope that you‚Äôve seen the tens of thousands. I mean, he‚Äôs had over half a million people easily, I think in excess of that. These are U.S.A.-loving Americans.‚Äù 
Tapper went on to say that no, he isn‚Äôt putting all Trump supporters into that camp, but went on to force Conway‚Äôs hand on this one: 
‚ÄúBut without question, people who are experts on hate groups say that there has been a comfort level that has been offered to people who are anti-Semitic that has been offered to people who are anti-Semitic and racists and on and on. And these people are comfortable coming out in the open and supporting Mr. Trump. 
Mr. Trump has refused to condemn in a very serious way his racist and anti-Semitic fans,‚Äù Tapper continued. ‚ÄúHe just has. He says things like, ‚ÄúOh, sure, I disavow, I disavow.‚Äô But he has never serious said, ‚ÄòI don‚Äôt want the support of those people, they are reprehensible, they have nothing to do with me.‚Äô He has never seriously done it.‚Äù 
Conway used the pushing to pivot back to the idea that the Trump campaign is winning, saying: 
‚ÄúI think this exchange is frankly the best piece of evidence I have that we‚Äôre actually going to win in nine days because the idea that we‚Äôre going to shift away from the pattern of corruption the cloud of ethical stain that Hillary Clinton would bring to the Oval Office in such an important week.‚Äù 
No, Kellyanne, it‚Äôs not a sign that Trump is winning. It‚Äôs pointing something out that has been true since this whole fiasco began: That Donald Trump is a raging bigot, and he has been so openly. Dog whistles have turned into fog horns this election cycle, and it‚Äôs all because of Donald Trump. He embraces these bigots because he‚Äôs one of them. The quicker you learn that, the better.

Internet Erupts In Mockery After Sarah Palin Posts Something Monumentally Stupid Again (TWEETS),"on October 30, 2016 4:07 pm ¬∑ 
For like the eleventy-billionth time, Sarah Palin posted a broken link to a Facebook post on Twitter Sunday. Now, at first glance her months of posting dead links and not figuring out how to fix the problem might seem moderately stupid ‚Äî until you see the content of the actual post on the half-term, half-wit former Governor of Alaska‚Äôs Facebook timeline. 
Referencing Clinton‚Äôs recent, mundane campaign stop at a bar, Palin ‚Äî who regularly appears to be heavily intoxicated whenever she has a camera in front of her and was involved in a drunken hillbilly brawl in 2014 ‚Äî quipped, ‚Äúshe‚Äôs gonna drive us all to drink.‚Äù 
Thinking she is clever, she then adds that Clinton should have been ‚Äúthinking Sam Adams‚Äù rather than ‚Äúdrinking Sam Adams.‚Äù 
Naturally, as Palin brought up drinking, the internet decided it couldn‚Äôt let this one go: @SarahPalinUSA I see you've already started 
‚Äî Clodagh Smith (@Clodagh831) October 30, 2016 @SarahPalinUSA Any excuse to drink, eh Sarah? #Lush

Trump Supporters Booby Trap Polling Place And Spill Blood Of Election Volunteer (VIDEO) | Addicting Info | The Knowledge You Crave,"on November 3, 2016 12:22 am ¬∑ 
Donald Trump‚Äôs deplorable supporters aren‚Äôt waiting for the election results to start spilling blood. 
They‚Äôve been threatening bloody violence ever since Trump began claiming that the election is ‚Äúrigged‚Äù in favor of Hillary Clinton. And Trump has called for them to intimidate voters at polling places. 
In Texas last week, a Trump supporter was arrested for electioneering at a polling place because he was wearing one of Trump‚Äôs stupid hats and a ‚ÄúDeplorables‚Äù T-shirt to vote. 
Election code prohibits any person from electioneering within 100 feet of a polling place. 
Of course, Trump supporters threw a temper tantrum because they think the rules don‚Äôt apply to them. 
Well, now it looks like they have retaliated by setting up a booby trapped Trump sign at a polling place knowing that an official or volunteer would have to take the sign down. 
At Collin College in Plano, Texas a Trump sign was discovered zip-tied to an official polling location sign in direct violation of the election code that forbids electioneering at polling places. 
But when a volunteer went out to remove the sign they got a nasty surprise in the form of box cutter blades that were strategically hidden inside. The blades sliced into the volunteer‚Äôs hands and drew blood, requiring medical attention and prompting officials to order that signs be checked thoroughly before removal. 
‚ÄúIt just shows how far we have come in politics where people want to be so mean and so hateful to try and injure somebody who‚Äôs probably not got any political party persuasion one way or the other,‚Äù local Democratic Party campaign chair Steve Spainhouer said in response . ‚ÄúI think most people have already made their minds up at this point how they‚Äôre going to vote and so there‚Äôs nothing to gain by being mean spirited or hateful.‚Äù 
Here‚Äôs the video via KTVT . 
Frankly, this should be considered an act of domestic terrorism. Trump‚Äôs supporters have gone too far and it could get worse as Election Day approaches. And if Trump loses, his supporters have already threatened to try to overthrow the federal government in a bloody coup. 
Clearly, these people are deranged and the safety of voters and election officials are in danger. But you won‚Äôt hear Donald Trump condemning this act of violence. After all, he is the one inciting it.

‚ÄòI Don‚Äôt Rent To N s‚Äô: Smoking Gun Proves Trump Family Racism (VIDEO) | Addicting Info | The Knowledge You Crave,"on October 25, 2016 10:41 pm ¬∑ 
New video has surfaced adding to the mountain of evidence that while working alongside his father, Fred Trump, young Donald Trump was part of a real estate business that discriminated against minority applicants. 
As part of an investigation by NBC News, Stanley Leibowitz, who worked as a rental agent for the Trump Organization, told the news network that he personally witnessed the elder Trump explicitly lay out a racist policy for their apartment properties. 
In the interview, Leibowitz said that Trump told him ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt rent to the n-word,‚Äù and indicates that Trump made this statement with Donald Trump in the room and that the younger Trump affirmed the policy. 
The revelation comes at the same time that the Clinton campaign has released a video highlighting Trump‚Äôs run-in with the federal government over discrimination. 
Undercover investigators were sent to Trump properties, and there they repeatedly ran into a policy where black applicants with identical financial backgrounds to white applicants were systematically denied housing. The white applicants were allowed into the Trump properties. 
One bit of testimony determined that Trump property managers indicated applications from blacks by putting a ‚ÄúC‚Äù on the documents for ‚Äúcolored,‚Äù and that was a sign that they should be denied. 
The Trumps denied the allegation, but later settled with the government over the policy without admitting wrongdoing. 
Donald Trump‚Äôs involvement with his father‚Äôs business is key to the entire story of his rise to prominence in the real estate world and the media, as is his father‚Äôs $14 million dollars that he gave to Trump to start his business. But if you accept that, the Trump Organization‚Äôs history of racial discrimination and the legal entanglements that come with that are also part of the story, and no matter how Trump may try to wave it away ‚Äì it‚Äôs still there.

Former Classmate: Trump Smacked His Son So Hard It Knocked ‚ÄòHim To The Floor‚Äô | Addicting Info | The Knowledge You Crave,"on November 4, 2016 12:25 pm ¬∑ 
We‚Äôve all seen pictures of the Trumps in their home surrounded by tacky gold decor, complete with their young son Barron in a suit with toys in front of him while he stares at the camera off to the side of his parents. It‚Äôs a life most of us can never imagine while we‚Äôre paying our monthly bills. So what‚Äôs it like growing up with Donald Trump as a father? According to Scott Melker, a former classmate of Donald Trump Jr.‚Äôs, at the University of Pennsylvania, being the former reality show star‚Äôs son wasn‚Äôt what one might imagine. Or, given Trump‚Äôs temperament, it might be exactly what you‚Äôd imagine. 
On Facebook , Mekler told of the animosity Trump‚Äôs son had for this father. 
‚ÄúI was hanging out in a freshman dorm with some friends, next door to Donald Jr.‚Äôs room. I walked out of the room to find Donald Trump at his son‚Äôs door, there to pick him up for a baseball game,‚Äù he recalls. ‚ÄúThere were quite a few students standing around watching, trying to catch a glimpse of the famed real estate magnate. Don Jr. opened the door, wearing a Yankee jersey.‚Äù 
Then Mekler told of the moment Trump slapped his son in the face in front of others. 
‚ÄúWithout saying a word, his father slapped him across the face, knocking him to the floor in front of all of his classmates. He simply said ‚Äúput on a suit and meet me outside,‚Äù and closed the door,‚Äù Melker wrote. 
‚ÄúDonald Jr. was a drunk in college. Every memory I have of him is of him stumbling around campus falling over or passing out in public, with his arm in a sling from injuring himself while drinking,‚Äù he continued. ‚ÄúHe absolutely despised his father, and hated the attention that his last name afforded him. His nickname was ‚ÄúDiaper Don,‚Äù because of his tendency to fall asleep drunk in other people‚Äôs beds and urinate.‚Äù ‚ÄúI always felt terrible for him,‚Äù he continued. 
Mekler said part of his reason for voting for Hillary Clinton is because ‚Äúin light of what I saw that day, it is clear to me that Donald Trump lacks the temperament and basic social decency to run our country.‚Äù 
To be clear, we are not demonizing Trump‚Äôs son for having an alleged drinking problem during his college days. Whether Melker‚Äôs story is accurate or not, we‚Äôre not sure, but given Trump‚Äôs awful temper, it‚Äôs difficult to discount it.

"BREAKING: Melania Trump‚Äôs Immigration Records Made Public, Show Trump‚Äôs ULTIMATE Hypocrisy | Addicting Info | The Knowledge You Crave","on November 4, 2016 10:58 pm ¬∑ 
GOP presidential nominee Donald Trump has taken a ridiculously hardline ‚Äì and even bigoted ‚Äì stance on immigration. He has promised to build a wall and force Mexico to pay for it, and he has said that he will erect ‚Äúdeportation forces‚Äù to root out and get rid of all people in the United States without proper documentation. Well, as we already knew, it turns out that The Donald is the ultimate hypocrite on this one. 
According to the Associated Press , it turns out that Donald Trump‚Äôs wife Melania violated immigration laws by working illegally in the United States when she first arrived from her native Slovenia. Melania often modeled using just her first name, and was first granted entry into the country on a visitor‚Äôs visa, known as a B1/B2 visa. This occurred on August 27, 1996. Melania did not get a legal work visa until October 18, 1996. During the time when she was prohibited from working in the country, Melania made money on ten different modeling assignments, totaling upwards of $20,000. She got a green card in 2000, and became a naturalized citizen in 2006. 
So, in other words, Melania Trump lied about her immigration story, as recently as Thursday, when she once again touted how a million percent legal immigration is the only way to go, and that this is how she did it. Melania said, in part, in her stump speech: 
‚ÄúAs a young entrepreneur, I wanted to follow my dream to a place where freedom and opportunity were in abundance. So of course, I came here. Living and working in America was a true blessing, but I wanted something more. I wanted to be an American.‚Äù 
Well, it appears that, as has long been suspected, that Melania Trump wasn‚Äôt as kosher in her immigration and work practices as she claims. The information obtained by the AP include, but are not limited to, her contract from Metropolitan International Management ‚Äì a modeling agency. Also, there‚Äôs the ledgers from the agency, which is no longer in business, that shows Melania working during the time when she had the visitor‚Äôs visa, but no work visa. It seems to be a complicated story full of many attempts to cover up Melania‚Äôs wrongdoing, but it is certainly quite interesting. This would be why Melania Trump never released actual records regarding her initial immigration to the United States and her eventual path to citizenship. While it is unlikely that her citizenship is at risk, it certainly means that she committed immigration fraud. You can read more here at the Associated Press . 
The long and short of it is this: Donald Trump launched his crazy bid for the presidency preying on the fears of the ‚Äúother.‚Äù Namely, immigrants. That is the height of hypocrisy, seeing as how his own wife didn‚Äôt completely comply with immigration law. Hopefully this story, and the many other lies and cover-ups and shady dealings surrounding the Trump campaign break through the hypnotism that the demagogue has spun onto so many desperate citizens of this great country, and they figure out that they are falling for the biggest con of all time.

Unhinged Trump Supporter Holds Children AT GUNPOINT Over Damaged Trump Sign (VIDEO),"on November 4, 2016 4:45 pm ¬∑ 
If you had wanted to give Trump supporters the benefit of the doubt, this most recent incident proves that it‚Äôs far too much to give them. 
A 56-year-old man in Allen Park, Michigan has just been charged with six felonies after he held six children at gunpoint because he thought they‚Äôd damaged the Donald Trump sign on his lawn. Yes, this is the kind of deranged, emotionally unstable supporters Trump has attracted. 
The man, Michael Robert Kubek, had called police on October 29th to report that his Trump sign had been hit by teenagers, who had fled the scene. When the police arrived at the scene, they didn‚Äôt find Kubek at his home ‚Äì however, when the officers followed the screams coming from around the corner, there he was. 
The police saw Kubek standing over six children ages 12-14, who were sitting on the grass. Kubek accused the children of destroying his sign despite the fact that he never actually witnessed them doing it. The children denied any involvement, and the officers told Kubek to return to his house so they could speak to the children. 
According to the kids, they were simply on their way to the park for a birthday celebration when Kubek had pulled out a gun and pointed it at them, instructing them to sit down on the grass. Those witnessing the act took to social media to vent their shock: Twitter Twitter 
The News-Herald reported: 
‚ÄúThe officer asked him again if he could identify any of the kids as the one who damaged his sign, but Kubek repeated that he could not. The officer then asked Kubek if he pulled out a pistol and pointed it at the kids. According to police, Kubek said ‚Äúyes.‚Äù 
In response to another question from the officer, Kubek said he felt threatened because he was outnumbered.‚Äù 
Yes, a grown man used a gun because he felt ‚Äúoutnumbered‚Äù by a small group of innocent kids. This is EXACTLY the type of unhinged person who shouldn‚Äôt be trusted with firearms! Kubek‚Äôs hearing is scheduled for December 5th ‚Äì let‚Äôs hope that whatever happens to Kubek, that he is no longer considered a responsible gun owner. You can watch a report below:

Watch Beyonc√© Tell The Entire World Why She Supports Hillary; Grab Your Tissues (VIDEO),"on November 5, 2016 4:50 pm ¬∑ 
Appearing at a concert for Hillary Clinton in Ohio alongside Chance the Rapper, Big Sean and her husband Jay Z, Beyonc√© let us all know why she‚Äôs ‚Äúwith her.‚Äù 
After explaining that she was so happy her nephew got to have Barack Obama to look up to and know he could one day be president, Beyonc√© then explained that this election is continuing on that path of progress. She explained that gender goes beyond that of any religion or race, and electing the first woman president is something she wants for her daughter. She said: 
‚ÄúI want my daughter to grow up seeing a woman lead our country and know that her possibilities are limitless.‚Äù 
Electing Hillary Clinton would break the mold of the United States being led by only men since its inception. However, that‚Äôs clearly not the only reason to elect Hillary. She is, by far, the most qualified person to run for President of the United States in more than a century.

The Toronto Star Published An ‚ÄòUnauthorized Database‚Äô Of Things That Will INFURIATE Trump | Addicting Info | The Knowledge You Crave,"on November 6, 2016 3:40 pm ¬∑ 
Trying to catch the liar of liars in a lie isn‚Äôt hard. Getting him and his campaign to acknowledge that Trump is the liar of liars is. Same thing with bullying, but The New York Times put together a spread of all the bullyish things Trump has said and tweeted, and to whom. Now, the Toronto Star ‚Äòs Daniel Dale has been tracking Trump‚Äôs lies for just six weeks, and the paper has compiled a complete list of those lies, which you can find here . 
There are literally hundreds of lies in Trump‚Äôs speeches. They‚Äôre not all 100% unique, but this is probably the final and ultimate proof that Trump will say anything to smear anyone, including his enemies, while keeping his supporters happy. 
Is there any presidential candidate in history that has lied this much? Tons of people claim Hillary is a master liar, but first, she‚Äôs actually more honest than most politicians. Second, even if she could be considered anything like a master liar, she still could not compete with Trump the Liar in any way, shape or form. 
The Star put the lies into a whopping 20 categories: Clinton‚Äôs policies, WTF, Daesh/Middle East, Clinton‚Äôs record, African Americans/Inner cities, The Clintons‚Äô corruption, Rigged election, Trade/Economy, Health care, Trump‚Äôs endorsements, Refugees/Immigration, Polls, Obama‚Äôs record, The campaign, Russia, Trump‚Äôs record, Taxes, Sex assault allegations, Clinton‚Äôs health and Government corruption. 
They also compiled a list of the top 10 types of lies Trump has told and gave more detailed analysis, beginning with, ‚ÄúThe electoral system is rigged.‚Äù Of course, it‚Äôs rigged against him: 
‚ÄúAfter plummeting in the polls after the first two debates, Trump began to repeatedly question the fairness of the election. ‚ÄòRigged‚Äô became his catchword. 
He claimed Hillary Clinton campaign workers hired ‚Äòthugs‚Äô to cause violence at his rallies, twisting the evidence from an undercover video to unfairly disparage Clinton. He claimed there was widespread voter fraud in Philadelphia, Chicago and St. Louis ‚Äî cities with large black populations that heavily favour Democrats. 
In Greeley, Colo., Trump told his supporters if they don‚Äôt trust mail-in ballots, they should vote again in person. So, one did. Trump supporter Terri Lynn Rote, a 55-year-old from Iowa, was charged by police for suspicion of voting twice.‚Äù 
Nobody‚Äôs committing voter suppression and fraud quite like Trumpsters and Republicans. 
Another is, ‚ÄúMuslims are risky.‚Äù This touches on his assertions that we know nothing about refugees coming from Syria, who could be the great Trojan Horse of our time: 
‚ÄúHis claims that Syrian refugees ‚Äî 99 per cent are Muslim ‚Äî are terrorists plays to the fears of the ‚Äúother,‚Äù even though they are extensively vetted and are predominantly women and children. And their numbers is nowhere near Trump‚Äôs claims ‚Äî about 13,000 have been admitted to the United States in 2016.‚Äù 
‚ÄúThe polls favour Trump.‚Äù Har de har har ‚Äì Trump only looks at the polls he likes, and they‚Äôre usually unscientific online polls or other dubious polls. Very few of the established, scientific polls favor him. Nevertheless: 
‚ÄúIt seems clear Trump manipulates, exaggerates or makes up polls that make it sound as if he is doing better than he actually is. This ‚Äòpoll denialism‚Äô gives his supporters licence to dismiss negative polling data, suggests CNN. 
His false claims cast doubt on the legitimacy of mainstream polling ‚Äî and perhaps even the vote itself. If supporters feel Trump should be doing better, then the idea of a rigged election seems more credible. 
On Oct. 24, he said ‚ÄòI won the last two debates, and every poll showed it.‚Äô In fact, every scientific poll showed that he lost. 
Of course, when unscientific online polls came out in his favour, Trump was quick to promote ‚Äî and exaggerate ‚Äî those numbers.‚Äù 
But these are just a few of his biggest, most repeated lies. He has also: Falsely said on Twitter, ‚ÄúThe failing NYTimes reporters don‚Äôt even call us anymore, they just write whatever they want to write, making up sources along the way!‚Äù Falsely said, ‚ÄúBy ‚Äòopen borders,‚Äô [Hillary] means totally unlimited immigration.‚Äù Falsely said, ‚ÄúHillary‚Äôs plan includes an open border with the Middle East.‚Äù Falsely called NBC anchor Lester Holt, the moderator of the first debate, ‚Äúa Democrat.‚Äù Falsely said, ‚ÄúWow, just came out on secret tape that Crooked Hillary wants to take in as many Syrians as possible.‚Äù Falsely said the U.S. provided Iran ‚Äú$150 billion‚Äù as part of the nuclear deal. Falsely said, ‚ÄúIn San Bernardino, many people saw the bombs all over the apartment of the two people that killed 14 and wounded many, many people‚Ä¶Muslims have to report the problems when they see them.‚Äù Falsely asserted that Clinton has ‚Äúbeen fighting ISIS (her) entire adult life.‚Äù Falsely said, ‚ÄúAll together, the Hillary Clinton plan would bring in 620,000 refugees in her first term.‚Äù Falsely claimed he had been acknowledged to be correct in declaring NATO ‚Äúobsolete because it doesn‚Äôt cover terror;‚Äù falsely suggested NATO created an anti-terror position because of his comments. Falsely claimed Clinton didn‚Äôt release cholesterol or EKG information Falsely said sexual assault allegations against him ‚Äúhave been largely debunked.‚Äù Falsely said, apparently of sexual assault accuser Summer Zervos, ‚ÄúThe one young lady has five family members saying what she said is absolute nonsense.‚Äù Falsely said ‚ÄúI did not. I did not‚Äù to Clinton‚Äôs charge that he thinks Climate change is a ‚Äúhoax perpetrated by the Chinese.‚Äù Falsely said, ‚ÄúI was against going into Iraq. And it‚Äôs so well-documented.‚Äù Falsely said, ‚ÄúOur taxes are so high. Just about the highest in the world.‚Äù 
And so many more, just in the last six weeks! Yes, many of them are repeats, but lies are lies. If Trump sees this, he‚Äôll likely throw a livid fit about it and claim that the paper‚Äôs lying, and continue to sell the myth that he‚Äôs not the liar of liars being caught in a squillion lies.

SNL Gets Real And Delivers The Most Important Message Of The Election Year (VIDEO),"on November 6, 2016 8:03 am ¬∑ 
Saturday Night Live has helped bring quite a bit of levity to this otherwise horrific election year but in the final episode before the election, before we as a nation go to the polls and decide if we want to be extraordinary or ‚Äúdeplorable,‚Äù the cast of Saturday Night Live could not help but drop the act and get real with America. 
It began as it normally does, with Alec Baldwin‚Äôs masterful Donald Trump character and Kate McKinnon‚Äôs excellent portrayal of Hillary Clinton (if she spent all day every day mainlining a dangerous mixture of sugar and caffeine). 
‚ÄúI never use emails,‚Äù Trump says in the cold opener. ‚ÄúI use a very private, very secure site where one can write whatever they want to and no one can read it It‚Äôs called Twitter.‚Äù 
After he is informed that everyone can see his tweets, ‚ÄúTrump‚Äù replies: 
‚ÄúReally? And I‚Äôm still in this thing? America you must really hate this lady.‚Äù 
After a scathing rebuke of the media‚Äôs decision to ignore Trump‚Äôs cozy relationship with Putin, the KKK, and the FBI and instead focus on something as meaningless as Hillary Clinton‚Äôs emails, something magical happened: McKinnon and Baldwin dropped the facade and got serious. 
‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry, Kate. I just hate yelling all this stuff at you like this,‚Äù Baldwin says. ‚ÄúI just feel gross all the time about this. Don‚Äôt you all feel gross?‚Äù he added, addressing the audience. 
McKinnon agrees and the two embark on a ‚Äúfriendship montage‚Äù through the city before returning to the stage. Then they dropped perhaps the most important message you will hear this election year. ‚ÄúNone of this would have mattered if you don‚Äôt vote,‚Äù Baldwin says. 
‚ÄúWe can‚Äôt tell you who to vote for, but on Tuesday we all get a chance to choose what kind of country we want to live in,‚Äù McKinnon finishes. 
They‚Äôre right.",1
Lindsey Graham Wants Trump To Put Ted Cruz On The Supreme Court Bench,"on November 11, 2016 3:30 pm ¬∑ 
As if the election of Donald Trump couldn‚Äôt get even more disastrous and hypocritical, Senator Lindsey Graham just called on Trump to nominate a right-wing extremist to nation‚Äôs highest court. 
All year long, Republicans have been blocking President Obama‚Äôs nomination of Merrick Garland to the Supreme Court because they want the next president to make the pick. And because they now have the conservative puppet president they have always wanted, they want to make sure that nominee is a conservative extremist. 
South Carolina Senator Lindsey Graham told WYFF-TV that Trump should pick Texas Senator Ted Cruz as the nominee and warned Democrats not to block him, which is hypocritical considering how Republicans have treated President Obama‚Äôs nominee and threatened to block any nominees Hillary Clinton would have made had she won the election. 
‚ÄúI‚Äôm here to tell my Democratic colleagues that I voted for Obama‚Äôs nominees. I expect them to give Trump‚Äôs nominees a fair shake. He won this election. He will pick a conservative. I would put Ted Cruz on that list. If they try to block this pick, they will regret it. If you don‚Äôt honor Trump‚Äôs nominee, you‚Äôre making a huge mistake.‚Äù 
Democrats should stand up and give Graham a collective middle finger. 
Since Antonin Scalia died in February, there has been a vacancy on the Supreme Court bench that has yet to be filled. The body wasn‚Äôt even cold yet before Republicans vowed to block any nominee President Obama picked to replace him, going so far as to even deny Garland a confirmation hearing. That‚Äôs far from the ‚Äúfair shake‚Äù Graham is asking Democrats to give to a man as dangerous as Ted Cruz. 
Putting Cruz on the Supreme Court would guarantee rulings against women‚Äôs rights and LGBT rights as well as putting laws like the Voting Rights Act and the Civil Rights Act in further peril. In no uncertain terms should Democrats grant Cruz a hearing, nor should they respect any of Trump‚Äôs conservative choices for the court. Republicans should have thought about ‚Äúfair shakes‚Äù before taking the totally unprecedented step of being complete assholes toward the Supreme Court nominee of a sitting president who also won an election and s far more popular than Trump. Again, Senate Republicans didn‚Äôt even give Garland a hearing or a vote. They refused to do their jobs entirely out of disrespect towards President Obama. And so that‚Äôs exactly what Democrats should do to Trump. Turnabout is fair play and Republicans only have themselves to blame.

"Michelle Obama Poses In A Pretty Dress, So Racist Conservatives Call Her A ‚ÄòMonkey‚Äô (SCREENSHOTS)","on November 12, 2016 3:54 pm ¬∑ 
Trump fans may have won the election, but they aren‚Äôt taking a break from expressing their racist hatred of Michelle Obama. The Donald‚Äôs Deplorables were out in force after the First Lady posed for the cover of Vogue. 
‚ÄúI could have spent eight years doing anything , and at some level, it would have been fine,‚Äù Obama told the magazine . ‚ÄúI could have focused on flowers. I could have focused on decor. I could have focused on entertainment. Because any first lady, rightfully, gets to define her role. There‚Äôs no legislative authority; you‚Äôre not elected. And that‚Äôs a wonderful gift of freedom.‚Äù 
In exercising her freedom, Michelle Obama has done quite a bit to push education, healthy eating, and support for our veterans ‚Äî and in exercising their freedom, the Right has responded with nothing but hate. The reaction to the First Lady appearing in elegant clothing was typical. Readers of Yahoo News showered Obama with racist remarks, calling her an ‚Äúape‚Äù and a ‚Äúmonkey‚Äù and even wishing death upon her for the horrific crime of wearing pretty clothes. 
If you thought this behavior would stop after the election, you were wrong. Trump fans are not done by a long shot ‚Äî and now they have been emboldened by America electing its first official KKK candidate. 
It will get worse before it gets better.

Racist Sign Calls For Lynching Black People To Prevent Them From Getting Equal Rights,"on November 13, 2016 3:09 pm ¬∑ 
As predicted, Donald Trump‚Äôs victory on Election Day has emboldened racist conservatives to start harassing and attacking minorities. 
And it‚Äôs even happening in the deep blue state of California, where a woman spotted a sign hanging on the side of a building in the town of Pittsburg and snapped a photo of it. 
Twitter user James Thompson posted the image of the sign on the social media platform after his sister sent it to him. This picture was taken in Pittsburgh California. My sister texted this to me 10 minutes ago.Our democracy is being tested even in California pic.twitter.com/gDLKw54Lox 
‚Äî James Thompson (@JETBallin) November 13, 2016 
The sign clearly promotes lynching to prevent African-Americans from getting equal rights. 
‚ÄúYou can hang a n****r from a tree / Equal rights he will never see!‚Äù it says. 
The FBI has been notified and local police have filed a lawsuit in an effort to force the owners of the sign to remove it. 
In the wake of Trump‚Äôs surprising and depressing victory there has been a rise in the number of racist incidents in this country. In fact, there have been 139 reports of people being bullied by Trump supporters since the election night results. 
These incidents include the harassment of a Muslim teacher by a student in Georgia, and students designating water fountains ‚Äúwhite‚Äù or ‚Äúcolored‚Äù at a Florida high school. 
Frankly, there are so many incidents that it‚Äôs difficult to list them all. You can find a somewhat comprehensive tally here . 
This is what Trump‚Äôs America looks like and it‚Äôs scary. And this has all happend in the course of a few days as Melania Trump continues to tell the media that her focus will be on ending bullying. What exactly does she mean by that? Is she going to call out all bullying, including the racist bullying being perpetrated by her husband‚Äôs own supporters? Or is she going to ignore those incidents and merely whine about people who criticize her husband. Because right now, she isn‚Äôt even First Lady yet and her ‚Äúeffort‚Äù has failed miserably. And she only has her husband to blame.",1
"Trump Supporters Didn‚Äôt Vote Because Of The Economy; It Was Racism, And Here‚Äôs PROOF","on November 13, 2016 4:03 pm ¬∑ 
Post election, the media and Donald Trump voters everywhere have been rewriting recent history. They are making the claim that Trump wasn‚Äôt elected because of racism; he was elected because of the economy. The problem with that argument, though, is that it‚Äôs simply not true. Trump voters are racist and there‚Äôs proof. 
The American National Elections Study (ANES) began the study in January. Initially, they asked ‚ÄúHow likely is it that many whites are unable to find a job because employers are hiring minorities instead.‚Äù Now, of course, anyone who spends more than five minutes listening to those in minority communities know the answer to that. It‚Äôs VERY unlikely that whites aren‚Äôt getting jobs because minorities are, but that‚Äôs not what Trump voters think. The vast majority said that it‚Äôs ‚Äúextremely likely‚Äù that minorities are taking jobs from white people. Graph courtesy of ANES and Salon . 
Then, they asked the same Trump voters about a non-racial issue, trade. Despite the fact that trade was one of Trump‚Äôs signature issues, their opinions on trade were mixed. 
Post election, this is what the study found: 
The question about white jobs is powerfully linked to support for Trump over Clinton. Eighty-four percent of whites who believe it is ‚Äúextremely likely‚Äù that whites can‚Äôt find a job because employers are hiring people of color instead support Trump, compared with 23 percent of those who think it is ‚Äúnot at all‚Äù likely. Among white Democrats, 58 percent who believe people of color are taking jobs support Trump over Clinton, compared with less than 1 percent of those who believe it is not at all likely. Eighty-one percent of white women who think it is ‚Äúextremely likely‚Äù people of color are taking jobs supported Trump, compared with 26 percent who don‚Äôt think that. 
More than that, 78 percent of white Trump supporters say black people are ‚Äúviolent.‚Äù 84 percent think that of Muslims. 
Unfortunately, Democrats might not be able to just ride out this wave of racism, hoping that eventually, the aging bigots will die off. It turns out their children are just as bad. Sean McElwee, the man who was responsible for publishing the study, suggested this: 
Democrats must create a narrative that weaves economic, racial and gender justice together. A multiracial coalition is the path to sustained political power and reductions in economic, racial and gender inequality. As I‚Äôve shown with political scientist Jason McDaniel, racism often diminishes support for progressive policies. The solution is not to abandon either the white working class or the diverse and rising American electorate that still stands poised to transform the nation. 
Great idea, if we had a media that reported facts instead of letting bigots‚Äô claims go unchallenged.

Megyn Kelly Makes BOMBSHELL Admission About Trump And The Media,"on November 13, 2016 12:43 pm ¬∑ 
Before the leaked tape of Donald Trump describing his propensity to grab women ‚Äúby the pussy‚Äù to Billy Bush, it seemed that the media was ignoring Donald Trump‚Äôs glaring faults as a presidential candidate. During the primaries , for example, he received far more positive media coverage than any of his competitors. It turns out there might be a reason for that ‚Äì Trump was bribing the media ‚Äì at least that‚Äôs the accusation being made by Megyn Kelly of Fox News. 
In her memoire ‚ÄúSettle for More,‚Äù which will be released this week, Kelly said that Trump likely received the infamous question, in which she asked about the fact that he has called women ‚Äúfat pigs, dogs, slobs and disgusting animals.‚Äù That question set Trump off on one of his Twitter tirades. These are only a portion: 
The worst and most controversial of which was this: 
As the election progressed, it became more and more apparent that Trump expected that no matter how egregious his behavior, he expected, no, demanded that the media kiss his orange ass. If they didn‚Äôt, he would cut off access, but before that, he tried bribery. 
While Kelly couldn‚Äôt speak for other members of the media, she alleges that Trump attempted to buy positive coverage by offering free stays at his hotels, with full perks. While the attempt clearly didn‚Äôt work on Kelly, she says that with some, their loyalty came cheap, or perhaps not so cheap. 
‚ÄúThis is actually one of the untold stories of the 2016 campaign: I was not the only journalist to whom Trump offered gifts clearly meant to shape coverage,‚Äù Kelly said. He also attempted to woo them with praise, she said, adding, ‚ÄúThis is smart, because the media is full of people whose egos need stroking.‚Äù 
‚ÄúTrump tried to work the refs, and some of the refs responded,‚Äù she said. 
When it became obvious that some reporters were ‚Äúin the tank‚Äù for Trump, she alleges in one chapter, ‚Äúcertain TV hosts‚Äù would work with the candidate in advance on occasional Trump criticism so they would appear unbiased. She didn‚Äôt identify them by name or media outlet. 
Source: Yahoo 
Kelly also asserts that the day before the debate in which Kelly asked about Trump‚Äôs treatment of women, the candidate called Fox News exec. Bill Sammon, who told him about the first question. All we heard about, though, during the election, was that it was Hillary Clinton who was fed a town hall debate question and it was hardly earth shattering. The insider knowledge said that a woman, in the Flint, Michigan debate, would ask a question about the Flint water . 
While bribing journalists isn‚Äôt illegal, per say, it is highly unethical. Without the Fourth Estate exposing the underbelly of politicians and of politics, democracy is impossible.

30 People Arrested For Food Stamp Fraud; Guess How Many Were Black,"on February 15, 2015 11:17 am ¬∑ 
It‚Äôs a common stereotype that food stamp recipients, and those who abuse it, are black, Hispanic, or any other race but white. According to the USDA in their report for fiscal year 2013, 40% of recipients are white and 26% are black. Courtesy of Travissonno.com 
While the media and America‚Äôs culture will have you believe that black people (or anyone who isn‚Äôt white) account for copious amounts of fraud, there‚Äôs a story breaking that you won‚Äôt hear on Fox ‚ÄúNews‚Äù anytime soon (or you might, because any chance to crush the SNAP program, they will take). 
According to WCAX News in New York: 
More than 30 people have been nabbed for food stamp fraud in the North Country. 
Investigators say over the past couple month‚Äôs people used their food stamps to get food or alcohol at the Old Time Butcher Block store in Brushton. 
Police also say it‚Äôs not the first time the owner of that store, Dennis Sauve, has been charged with allowing such fraud. 
Police say more arrests are expected. 
Now here‚Äôs the kicker: they‚Äôre all white. Brushton, New York, where this bust happened, has a population of roughly 480 people. Approximately 99.83% of the population is white, and 0.42% are black. These demographics are eerily similar to the food stamp capital of the country , Owsley Country, Kentucky, which is 99.22% white and 95% Republican. Maybe we should investigate them. 
I just wish we could get the political affiliations of those arrested in Brushton. 
According to WPTZ News: 
Police say the arrests are the result of a year-long investigation, initiated by the Franklin County Department of Social Services Fraud Unit. Franklin County District Attorney‚Äôs Office, the United States Department of Agriculture, and the New York State Office of Temporary and Disability Assistance helped with the investigation. 
The store owner, Denis Sauve (also white), has been charged with third-degree grand larceny and misuse of food stamps. 
This really isn‚Äôt a racial issue so much as it is an, ‚ÄúI told you so,‚Äù issue. While the food stamp program has one of the lowest rates of abuse than any other welfare program, a lot of people buy into this misconception that it is the ‚Äúlazy blacks‚Äù who account for all the fraud and woes of government assistance. Well, here we are, a major food stamp ‚Äúbust‚Äù and every criminal involved is white.

"‚ÄòThe Simpsons‚Äô React To Their Trump Election Prediction, And They‚Äôre NOT Happy (VIDEO)","on November 14, 2016 11:36 pm ¬∑ 
In reaction to Donald Trump‚Äôs victory, The Simpsons decided to update their 2000 prediction of a Trump presidency. 
In 2000, the show showed a glimpse into the future where President Lisa Simpson inherited an economic mess from ‚ÄúPresident Trump.‚Äù Well, now that fictional story line has become a horrifying reality. 
Here is The Simpsons new opening with Bart Simpson writing on the chalkboard, ‚ÄúBEING RIGHT SUCKS‚Äù: The Simpsons updates its 2000 prediction of a Trump Presidency‚Ä¶ #TheSimpsons pic.twitter.com/Myf5rYb9Dj 
‚Äî The Simpsons (@TheSimpsons) November 14, 2016 
Hopefully, the financial despair the fictional President Trump never becomes a reality, but seeing as he has no experience, is a businessman who‚Äôs not as good as he says he is, and The Simpsons have been right thus far, the future‚Äôs looking pretty bleak. 
Here‚Äôs the original clip of President Lisa Simpson calling out a Donald Trump presidency for his fiscal fallout and bad economy: 
Early on into Trump‚Äôs campaign, The Simpsons satirized the reality TV host turned president-elect by having Homer Simpson somehow at the campaign rollout and falling into Trump‚Äôs hair. If we could only go back to that moment and enjoy the comedy over reality. 
Now we have to reap what we‚Äôve sown, or rather what the less than half of voting Americans have sown considering Trump only won with the Electoral College and lost the popular vote to Hillary Clinton in his own words, big league. 
Most of us with The Simpsons were very wrong with the prediction as well.

"Bernie Sanders Rises In The Senate, Prepares To Become Trump‚Äôs WORST Nightmare (TWEETS) | Addicting Info | The Knowledge You Crave","on November 16, 2016 4:56 pm ¬∑ 
It was just a few days ago that Bernie Sanders responded to Trump‚Äôs election win with the perfect message from Democrats. He said : 
‚ÄúIf Donald Trump takes people‚Äôs anger and turns it against Muslims, Hispanics, African Americans and women, we will be his worst nightmare.‚Äù 
And from what was just announced, it seems that Sanders has every intention of making good on that warning. Earlier today, the Vermont Senator was named chair of outreach during a closed-door Senate Democrat caucus meeting, according to The Hill . In his new role, Sanders will lead outreach to blue-collar voters ‚Äî the very voters who became Trump supporters this year. Sanders will also be the ranking member on the Senate Budget Committee. Acknowledging that he has a ‚Äúheavy responsibility to help shape the priorities of the United States government,‚Äù Sanders said: ‚ÄúI‚Äôm going to do everything that I can to make sure that the budget that leaves the United States Congress is a budget that represents the needs of working families and a shrinking middle class and not billionaires.‚Äù With the announcement of Sanders‚Äô new position, Trump is definitely going to be a nervous wreck. He‚Äôs spent his entire presidential campaign claiming that he would help the working class, and now Sanders is in the position to challenge him and hold him to it for the next four years. By elevating Sanders to this new role, Democrats are moving to a more grassroots message, fully aware that Sanders‚Äô presidential campaign and vision for America resonated with many voters. As we saw with Sanders‚Äô popularity in the primaries, the Vermont Senator struck a nerve with workers and families, making him the perfect candidate to go up against Trump as he takes office. Sen. Debbie Stabenow (D-Mich.) commented on Sanders‚Äô new responsibility: ‚ÄúWe want to expand on that, and he will be reaching out to all our allies. We have a tremendous amount of talent in our caucus and we want to make sure everyone is contributing.‚Äù Sanders hardly needed this promotion to upset Trump, as he‚Äôs been one of the most outspoken politicians on Twitter since Trump‚Äôs win: Twitter Twitter Twitter 
However, Sanders‚Äô new role is great news for our country, and we know he‚Äôs going to give Trump hell.

"Trump ERUPTS At Secret Meeting With The Press, Transition In Chaos (TWEETS) | Addicting Info | The Knowledge You Crave","on November 21, 2016 7:58 pm ¬∑ 
Donald Trump has had a rocky relationship with the press ever since his presidential campaign, and he‚Äôs only punished them further for trying to report the truth since becoming the President-elect. 
On Monday, Trump was set to have an off the record meeting with television networks to try and hash out presidential press access. This meeting was particularly important because Trump has previously limited press access, and has ditched two protocol press pools since getting elected. 
Some reporters in attendance were NBC‚Äôs Deborah Turness, Lester Holt and Chuck Todd; ABC‚Äôs James Goldston, George Stephanopoulos, David Muir and Martha Raddatz; CBS‚Äô Norah O‚ÄôDonnell and Charlie Rose; Fox News‚Äô Bill Shine, Jack Abernethy, Jay Wallace, Suzanne Scott; MSNBC‚Äôs Phil Griffin; and CNN‚Äôs Jeff Zucker and Erin Burnett. It was a good group, and it could have been a very effective meeting if only things had gone according to plan. 
Unfortunately, instead of having a respectful conversation and coming up with an amicable way to move forward, what the press got was a baby Trump temper tantrum of epic proportions. Or, as one person put it , ‚ÄúIt was like a f*cking firing squad.‚Äù 
Trump made zero attempt to hide his disrespect for the media. According to The New York Post , one anonymous source said: 
‚ÄúThe meeting was a total disaster. The TV execs and anchors went in there thinking they would be discussing the access they would get to the Trump administration, but instead they got a Trump-style dressing down.‚Äù 
This claim was backed up by another person, who said: 
‚ÄúThe meeting took place in a big board room and there were about 30 or 40 people, including the big news anchors from all the networks. 
‚ÄúTrump kept saying, ‚ÄòWe‚Äôre in a room of liars, the deceitful dishonest media who got it all wrong. He addressed everyone in the room calling the media dishonest, deceitful liars. He called out Jeff Zucker by name and said everyone at CNN was a liar, and CNN was network of liars.‚Äù 
This attack left reporters stunned, and even as they tried to keep bringing up press access to stay on topic, Trump barely let them speak. While this is certainly shocking, this behavior is completely typical of Trump. He has always hated the free press because it has held him accountable and reported on his mistakes and shortcomings. 
Americans on social media are already coming to terms with how terrifying this is: Twitter Twitter Twitter 
Interestingly enough, Trump spokeswoman Kellyanne Conway had the nerve to say the meeting went well. She said: 
‚ÄúExcellent meetings with the top executives of the major networks. Pretty unprecedented meeting we put together in two days.‚Äù 
Disgraceful.

"Comment on HALLOWEEN IN THE CASTRO RETURNS IN 2014! by Day of the Dead 2015: History, food and reflections ‚Äì Andrea Lawson Gray","adobochron 10 Comments 
San Francisco, California ‚Äì It was an agreement four years in the making, oftentimes marred by shouting matches among city hall officials, representatives of the Sisters of Perpetual Indulgence, merchants and homeowners. But the Halloween party in San Francisco‚Äôs gay Castro district finally returns in 2014. 
It will be recalled that the Halloween bash attracted as many as 500,000 each year and has become a major tourist attraction, second and third only to the Pride parade and Folsom Street Fair. Stabbing and shooting incidents, believed to be perpetrated by straight revelers, prompted city officials to permanently ban the event beginning in 2010. 
As part of the agreement, the ‚Äúnew‚Äù Castro Halloween will be open only to members of the LGBTQ community who will have to register with city hall and be included in a ‚Äúgay registry.‚Äù Registrants, who will take an oath admitting that they are gay, lesbian, bisexual, transgender or questioning, will be issued special identification cards linked to the official registry. The IDs will be the only accepted pass to gain entry to the Halloween event. ID‚Äôs will be scanned at entrances to the event to confirm that individuals are listed in the official registry.

Comment on Tutorial: Riding The Philippine Jeepney by Ivan Jose,"adobochron 1 Comment 
MANILA, Philippines (The Adobo Chronicles, Manila Bureau) ‚Äì This is a tutorial on how to ride the jeepney which is an important mode of mass transportation in many cities and towns in the Philippines. 
Many of you may already be familiar with these rules, etiquette and tricks but for those who are visiting the country for the first time or are returning nationals (balikbayan) who have been away for a long time, you might want to keep this tutorial handy. First of all, not all jeepneys you encounter are as colorful, shiny and clean as the one pictured here. If you are bothered by smoke or the smell of gasoline, remember to always carry and wear a disposable surgical mask. It also helps with, you know, body odor. In most cases, there are no jeepney stops like there are bus stops. Wherever you are, be rest assured that so long as there is room for one more passsenger, the jeepney will stop for you. Speaking of room, when the driver says the capacity of his jeepney is 10 passengers on either side, you can‚Äôt argue. Ten means ten, even if only half your butt sits comfortably on the padded seat. Only cash payment is accepted, but you probably already know that. Exact fare is appreciated but Mr. Driver is happy to provide change except very early in the day. ‚ÄúBarya lang po sa umaga!‚Äù No five hundred peso bills in the morning, please. Jeepney fare is passed on from one passenger to another until it reaches the driver. The same is true for any change back due the passenger. It takes a village to ride the jeepney you know. If you don‚Äôt want to be bothered by other passengers asking you to pass on the fare to the driver, sit as far as possible from the driver, assuming that premium spot is vacant. The jeepney driver would appreciate it so much if you pay your fare before you start texting on your mobile phone. ‚ÄúGod knows who doesn‚Äôt pay,‚Äù says one jeepney sign. There are two phrases you need to learn when riding the jeepney: ‚ÄúBayad po‚Äù (here‚Äôs my fare) and ‚ÄúPara po‚Äù (this is my stop). If you don‚Äôt speak the language, no worries. Just pass on your fare to the passenger next to you and he or she will know what to do. And if you need to disembark, just knock on the jeepney‚Äôs roof. It also means ‚Äúplease stop.‚Äù There are discounted fares for students and seniors. Be sure to say ‚Äúone senior‚Äù or ‚Äúone student‚Äù when paying your fare. Otherwise, you pay full fare. Filipinos have learned to respect seniors and people with disabilities. The spot closest to the jeepney entrance (farthest from the driver) is reserved for them. Isn‚Äôt that nice? As always, hold on to the hand rails. It can be a very bumpy ride. Rate this:",1

MAKATI CITY, Philippines ( The Adobo Chronicles) ‚Äì When completed by the end of 2016, the Trump Tower in the Philippines will be among the country‚Äôs tallest buildings . But the Trump name may disappear from this upscale residential building. 
Launched in 2012, Trump Tower is a joint venture between Century Properties and the Trump Organization. It will be managed by Century Properties Management Inc. To rise at 250 meters above ground, the 56-story building is designed by award-winning international architectural firm Broadway Malyan. 
‚ÄúIt‚Äôs really just an iconic, modern building, very tall, very chic, something that really symbolizes everything that a Trump project means,‚Äù said Eric Trump, son of Donald, and executive vice president of development and acquisition. 
It is located at the corner of Kalayaan Avenue and Salamanca Street in Makati City. 
But today, Philippine President Rodrigo Roa Duterte issued an executive order canceling the building permit of the Trump Tower. 
Duterte called Donald Trump and his organization ‚Äúpersona non grata‚Äù for the Republican presidential candidate‚Äôs recent comments about the Philippines. 
It will be recalled that in one of his campaign speeches, Trump lumped the Philippines with other countries with terrorism links, calling for the banning Filipinos from immigrating to the United States. Duterte even challenged Trump to a fist fight. 
‚ÄúIf we, Filipinos, are not welcome in the United States, why would we welcome Trump in the Philippines,‚Äù Duterte said. 
Asked by The Adobo Chronicles what the Philippine government plans to do with the Trump Tower, Duterte replied, ‚ÄúI will make it a rehabilitation center for the more than half a million Filipino drug users who surrendered as part of my war on drugs.‚Äù

SAN FRANCISCO, California ( The Adobo Chronicles, San Francisco Bureau) ‚Äì Now it can be told ‚Äî now that Hillary Clinton is all but assured of the Democratic presidential nomination. 
For months since the former secretary of state launched her presidential bid, her campaign logo has always symbolized America‚Äôs quest to move forward, with the arrow in the logo pointing to the right. Left-handed people, of course, dispute that symbolism because for them, moving forward should be pointing to the left. 
But there is another school of thought about Hillary‚Äôs logo. Many believe that the arrow pointing right actually symbolizes moving to the (conservative) right as opposed to the (liberal) left. 
The logo was a brilliant concept designed to help the Democrats win over Republican voters in the general elections ‚Äî voters who will definitely choose a rightist over a leftist candidate. 
The GOP‚Äôs presumptive nominee, Donald Trump, is perceived by many as more leftist than rightist, which would give Clinton the edge among conservative voters.

"Comment on If Elected President, Donald Trump Will Not Live In The White House by Rebecca Bennett","adobochron 2 Comments The Trump hotels in Las Vegas, left, and Doral 
DES MOINES, Iowa ( The Adobo Chronicles) ‚Äì Since he launched his bid to be the Republican nominee for president of the United States, Donald Trump has made many promises, but nothing has caught the attention of the media and electorate more than what he said today in Iowa, on the eve of the first caucus of the 2016 presidential elections season. 
If elected president of the United States, Trump says he will not live in the White House.

The Adobo Chronicles asked Trump what will happen to the media and the White House press corps when he travels across the country or abroad. 
‚ÄúWell, they just have to book their own commercial flights and follow me around,‚Äù he said. 
Thousands of miles away in the Philippines, a leading presidential candidate said that if elected president, he will not live in Malaca√±ang ‚Äî the Filipino counterpart of the White House ‚Äî because he likes to sleep in his own bed. His bed is in Davao City of which he is currently the mayor.

Comment on Donald Trump To Replace Filipina White House Chef With Paula Deen by Mitch Jalandoni,"adobochron 1 Comment Comerford, left, and Deen 
WASHINGTON, D.C. ( The Adobo Chronicles, Washington Bureau) ‚Äì When Donald and Melania Trump officially move into the White House, there will be no pancit or chicken adobo on the family menu, just potato tot casserole and pumpkin pie. 
The president-elect has informed The Adobo Chronicles that he is firing Filipina White House Executive Chef Cristeta Comerford. She will be replaced by Paula Deen, American celebrity chef and former TV cooking show host. 
Paula Deen made headlines when a video surfaced in which Deen, in a deposition, admits to using the N-word and making racist and anti-semitic jokes. She also allegedly described her interest in hiring black waiters dressed to look like ‚Äúslaves‚Äù at a wedding.Jun 19, 2013.

Apple Adds ‚ÄòAlt-Right‚Äô Key To Its Computer Keyboards |,"adobochron Leave a comment 
CUPERTINO, California ( The Adobo Chronicles, San Jose Bureau) ‚Äì Technology giant Apple is known for its innovation and for constantly reinventing itself and its products. This strategy has spelled the company‚Äôs tremendous success across the globe. 
Occasionally, Apple immerses itself in politics and the current political atmosphere following the election of Donald Trump as the 45th U.S. president is one of those times. 
By now, the term Alt-Right (Alternative Right) has become a familiar phrase especially on social media. 
The Alternative Right, commonly known as the Alt-Right, is a set of far-right ideologies, groups and individuals whose core belief is that ‚Äúwhite identity‚Äù is under attack by multicultural forces using ‚Äúpolitical correctness‚Äù and ‚Äúsocial justice‚Äù to undermine white people and ‚Äútheir‚Äù civilization. Characterized by heavy use of social media and online memes, Alt-Righters eschew ‚Äúestablishment‚Äù conservatism, skew young, and embrace white ethno-nationalism as a fundamental value. 
In keeping up with this new political atmosphere, Apple has just announced that it will be replacing all keyboards on its desktops, laptops, iPhones and iPads with a new design that adds the ‚ÄúAlt-Right‚Äù key. The key will be located in the lowermost right corner of the keyboard. How appropriate 
Apple CEO Tim Cook said that the addition of this all-important key will enable those who subscribe to the Alternative Right ideologies (and idiosyncrasies) to identify themselves when sending emails, texts or posting on social media. Hitting the ‚ÄúAlt-Right‚Äù key will automatically add the hashtag #AlternativeRight to whatever a person is typing on the keyboard.

MANILA, Philippines ( The Adobo Chronicles, Manila Bureau) ‚Äì Advertising company McCann Worldgroup Philippines will be in charge of crafting the new tourism campaign of the country, the Department of Tourism (DOT) said over the weekend. 
Tourism undersecretary for advocacy and public affairs Katherine de Castro said the P650-million contract with McCann, which won the bid to be the advertising and promotions partner of the DOT for one year, includes the production and positioning of marketing materials, as well as the formulation of a new tourism slogan.

10 Things to Expect with a Hillary Clinton Presidency,"20 Shares
17 2 0 1
In last issue of Black Agenda Report, I argued that readers should vote for the Green Party this November. This week, I will outline what to expect from a Hillary Clinton Presidency. The great migration of Republicans into the Democratic Party tent of Hillary Clinton has guaranteed her victory in the highly undemocratic US Presidential elections. Corporate media outlets have collaborated with Clinton to instill deep popular fear of a Trump administration. Fear of Trump has been used to distract the many millions of people in the US who are fed up with both corporate parties. This has led to a lack of investigation and analysis of what can be expected once Hillary Clinton actually takes office.
The corporate media has exploited the general population's distaste for sexism and white supremacy in the process. Trump has made heinous statement after heinous statement, all of which should be taken seriously by anyone who calls themselves a movement activist. It is critical that the left in the US extend solidarity to those who experience the consequences of racism and sexism every day. However, Trump's vile character has been used as a means to legitimize the candidacy of Hillary Clinton. His characterization as a fascist has convinced many that his rule would be a greater danger to humanity than a Clinton Presidency.
One could endlessly debate Clinton supporters on the validity of such a claim. Trump's vulgar and putrid presentation has provided Clinton supporters with a convenient weapon of defense against all criticism of their own vile choice. Yet the lesser evil argument has never been weaker than in the 2016 elections. It is reasonable to assume that a Hillary Clinton Presidency will be far less effective than Obama in effecting capitalist and imperialist hegemony. This is why her support system, the entire ruling class, has gone into overdrive to spread fear of a Russia-Trump collaborative threat in every sphere of US political life.
Here are ten things to expect from a Clinton Presidency. I will leave it to readers to judge as to whether Clinton represents a ""lesser evil"" than Trump or just plain evil.
1.) The Privatization of Social Security - Hillary Clinton has stated publicly and privately to her Wall Street friends that she will reignite conversations to downsize the program. Wikileaks exposed Clinton's support for the Obama's Administration's ""deficit reduction"" commission that originally proposed cuts to entitlements such as Social Security and Medicare in 2012. Clinton donors on Wall Street have made it clear that they would love to get a hold of Social Security earnings and turn them into a financial market to be traded for profit.
MORE... Hillary Clinton must be indicted How Hillary Clinton ushered in a one party dictatorship of monopoly capital Voting for the ‚ÄúLesser Evil‚Äù John Pilger: Clinton policies will bring great aggression to the US and the world 2.) World War III - Hillary Clinton has stated in nearly every debate that her administration would consider placing a no-fly zone in Syria. That means US airstrikes would rain down on Syrian and Russian assets in Syria. Such a move would place the US military in direct confrontation with the Russia. Clinton has been caught stating that the Syrian and Russian lives that will die in such a conflict are well worth the benefits.
3.) The Transpacific Partnership - Often called ""NAFTA on steroids,"" the massive corporate trade agreement that captures much of Asia Pacific region has been a major talking point in the 2016 elections. Clinton has supported the agreement in the past, only to switch her position due to pressure from the Bernie Sanders campaign. With Sanders firmly in the Clinton camp, there is currently nothing in the way to stop Clinton from moving forward with the TPP's passage and making her private position on the deal a public reality.
4.) Maintenance and Expansion of the Surveillance State - Not much needs to be said here. The Obama Administration's vast expansion of the surveillance state has been exposed by the likes of Ed Snowden and Julian Assange. Wikileaks additionally revealed Clinton's desire to drone Julian Assange for releasing Washington‚Äôs secrets to the public. A Clinton Presidency has every intention of following up on the Obama Administration's passage of bills such as the National Defense Authorization Act of 2012. This bill gave the US government the right to militarily detain ""terror"" suspects indefinitely.
5.) Trump's Wall - Hillary Clinton was Obama's Secretary of State from 2009-2013. Over this time, she helped facilitate the largest deportation of undocumented people in US history. Furthermore, she oversaw the detention of thousands of Central American children during the great migration from the 2009 fascist coup in Honduras, a coup that was drawn up by Clinton herself. The US-Mexico border is more militarized than it has ever been. Trump's wall rhetoric was indeed a racist trip, but too few recognize that something just as dangerous actually exists under current US immigration policy.
6.) Servitude to the Bankers - Hillary Clinton has received over forty million in support from Hedge funds in the 2016 elections. Before selling out, Bernie Sanders made it a point to request public access into Clinton's private, quarter million dollar speeches to banks like Goldman Sachs. The deregulation of the banks with the passage of the Glass-Steagall Act was a Clinton project. Both her current list of donors and past connection to her husband‚Äôs policies make her the obvious choice for the finance capitalist class.
7.) Maintenance of the Mass Black Incarceration State - Hillary Clinton is the enemy of Black America. From her callous use of the term ""super predator"" to describe working class Black men to being the architect of the 1994 crime bill, the Clinton dynasty virtually built the mass Black incarceration state. Under Bill and Hillary Clinton's two terms, the prison population rose by 673,000. This was facilitated by draconian ""three strikes"" laws, mandatory drug sentence, and the deep militarization of local police departments. With her record, it isn't too difficult to assume what another four years of Clinton rule will bring in the realm of policing and prisons.
8.) Austerity and More Austerity - It was the first Clinton Administration that eliminated ""welfare as we know it."" The evisceration of Aid to Families and Dependent Children (AFDC) and its replacement, Temporary Assistance to Needy Families (TANF), threw millions of women and children into poverty. Obama has followed up with draconian cuts to SNAP (foodstamps). There is nothing on Clinton's track record that indicates her administration would do anything but roll back whatever social programs and protections still exist for the poor in the US.
9.) A Boost to the Privatization of Education - Hillary Clinton received boos in July when she urged teachers' unions and charter operators to ""work together"" for the greater good of students. Ever since, Clinton has attempted to exploit the rise of Sanders by courting teachers unions to endorse her. Her position has slightly softened on the privatization of education, but that hardly matters. Clinton receives broad support from school privatizers (like Wal-Mart) and should not be expected to roll back the ""shock and awe"" war on public education waged by the Obama Administration.
10.) An Economic Crisis - Bankers and economists have been predicting an economic crash for much of 2016. Capitalists everywhere were given free rein to ""recover"" with trillions in stimulus cash after sending the entire global capitalist economy into collapse in 2008. The internal contradictions of the system are only sharpening as workers become poorer and global production stagnates. Whether Clinton can manage a crisis in service of the capitalists as well Obama has remains to be seen.
Clinton may very well be the highest expression of ruling class consensus that has ever presented itself in an election season. Her political record represents a greater material threat to humanity than Donald Trump for the sheer fact that she is the preferred candidate of the ruling class. The question now is whether mass sentiment exists to organize around an alternative to the two-party corporate duopoly. Jill Stein and Ajamu Baraka are attempting to build the base of the Green party ticket. Whatever method is chosen, it must be wielded to combat lesser evil politics and build an organized force ready to struggle against the intensified suffering that will surely be imposed on the world by a Clinton Administration.",1

""ISIS terrorists continued to commit atrocities in the province of Nineveh, they executed 190 people in the area of Hammam al-Alil after taking them hostage in different areas of Mosul,"" said the chairman of the Iraqi parliamentary human rights committee, Abdel Rakhim Shamri, on Wednesday.
He added that another 42 people were taken from the village of Arij and executed after they refused to cooperate with the terrorists.
Shamri also called on Iraqi Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi to facilitate the airlifting of civilians from Daesh-held areas in Mosul as the terrorists are using them as human shields.
On Tuesday, the UN human rights office said it had preliminary reports about scores of mass killings by ISIS around Mosul in the past week.
UN human rights spokesman Rupert Colville told a regular UN briefing in Geneva that the bodies of 70 civilians with bullet wounds had been discovered by Iraqi security forces in Tuloul Naser village on October 20, and 50 police officers being held outside the city had also reportedly been killed, Press TV reported.

Clinton's Policies Look Like a Death Sentence for Americans,"22 Shares
8 13 0 1
As Donald Trump gains more bad press, Hilary Clinton rides the political wave with quick responses, deflections and denials. Without question, and largely due to Trump's obnoxious candor and grandiose proclamations, she is working her way back into the favor of disgruntled democrats and even right wing firebrands like the notorious Glenn Beck. She is, without question, a wolf in sheep's clothing. While Trump is unbelievably hard to take, constantly, we need to focus on one simple question, which of these candidates will lead to world devastation first?
I suspect it would be Hillary Clinton who would be most inclined toward involving Americans in another military conflict, and she doesn't go small, as she constantly demonizes Russia with threats of military action. In Clinton's own words, ""You've seen reports, Russia has hacked into a lot of things, China has hacked into a lot of things, Russia even hacked into the Democratic National Committee, maybe even some state election systems. So we've got to step up our game, make sure we are well defended and can take the fight to those who go after us. As President, I will make it clear that the United States will treat cyber attacks just like any other attack. We will be ready with serious political, economic and military responses.""
Military responses to a nation the US stood on the verge of war with for more than four decades? Military response against Russia? Over suspected hacking? Hillary Clinton betrayed her real mindset once and for all during the recent debate with Donald Trump when she spoke those words of war that would surely lead to only disastrous consequences.
It all stems from the Wikileaks release that included 19,252 emails and 8,034 attachments from leaders at the Democratic National Committee. Clinton says the Russians did it, the national mainstream media parroted those words. It's the American media's political conditioning system at its finest, convincingly reaching tens of millions of Americans, and yet nobody knows if the blame is properly attributed to the Russians. In a USA Today article from July 2016, Elizabith Weise wrote, ""Computer security researchers say it‚Äôs difficult to definitively say the cyber theft of files from the Democratic National Committee subsequently posted online by Wikileaks was the work of Russian hackers, as some media outlets have reported.""
Russia's leader, Vladmir Putin, says the US long ago tipped the scales in the wrong direction, well before the Cold War even ended. Peace with Russia should be a top priority for any US Presidential candidate. The truth is that American politicians, perpetually convinced they are making the right political moves, created a road block on the highway to peace during the Vietnam War. Putin said during the St. Petersburg International Economic Forum 2016, ""It is not in my nature to scold someone -- but when the United States unilaterally withdrew from the ABM Treaty (in) 1972 they delivered a colossal blow to the entire system of international security. That was the first blow when it comes to assessing the strategic balance of power in the world"".

World Rivals in the Air
There is a decades-old history of rivalry between eastern and western jet fighter design and technology. While American designs are more expensive and generally considered to be better, the fastest jet fighter ever made is the Russian MiG-25; it can break Mach III, more than three times the speed of sound. Such demands lessen the life of an aircraft. The MiG-25 is typically not flown at anything close to that speed. As an interceptor however, it was supreme, no allied fighter in the sky could outrun it.
The Korean War was the first test. Soviet MiG-15's initially dominated the skies. With Russian and Chinese pilots often at the controls, the MiG's were deadly.
On 1 November 1950, at least sixteen American F-51 fighters (P-51 Mustangs) were shot at by six Soviet MiG-15 interceptors led by Soviet WWII ace Mayor Nikolay V. Stroykov. The WWII ""prop"" planes like the Mustang, along with the U.S. F-80 Shooting Star and F-84 Thunderjet jet fighters, had a job on their hands fighting the robust and highly maneuverable MiG fighters.
Everything changed when the U.S. Air Force launched the F-86 Sabre. Wikipedia explains that the F-86 Sabre pilots enjoyed advantages they learned to exploit to the fullest. Foremost among those was a radar ranging gun sight on their six .50 caliber machine guns, which ensured that even short bursts of fire generally found their target. F-86 pilots were also equipped with G-suits, which prevented pilot blackout in high-speed turning maneuvers.
It is unlikely that anybody will ever fully agree on the casualties and ""kill"" ratios over ""MiG Alley"" during the Korean War.
The Soviets claimed 1,106 United Nations planes of all types shot down, including about 650 Sabres. (The USAF only admits to losing less than 200 aircraft in air combat.)
The F-86 pilots claimed 792 MiG-15s shot down, while B-29 gunners claimed a further 16. These numbers were later reduced to 379 MiGs. The Chinese air force claimed only 85 kills.
In Vietnam, the competitors varied. The MiG-17 and MiG-21 fighters were widely used by the North Vietnamese Air Force. They fought planes like the F-100 Super Sabre, F-5 Tiger and the F-4 Phantom. Once again, if you believe western sources which are fairly reliable for the most part, the U.S. planes dominated in most air to air combat, though the other side had plenty of talented pilots and more aces overall than the Americans. During the end of the Cold War in the 1980's, the Soviet MiG-29 was the terror of the skies. There was more speculation about it than real knowledge at first. While MiG aircraft were only built in odd numbers, the movie Top Gun references the aircraft by calling them MiG-28's - ""MiG-28's, no one's been this close before!"" The planes used in the movie were actually American F-5 Tigers painted black with red stars applied to the tails. Today the United States spends obscene amounts on planes like the F-22 Raptor and these aircraft do not have any clear advantages over modern Russian planes like the SU-30. Both in this case, are capable of ""thrust vectoring"" which means the pilot can change the direction of the jet blast and create an entirely separate way to control the jet in flight. The ultimate western jet in the world of thrust vectoring is the AV8/b Harrier which can actually take off and land like a helicopter. Hopefully the world will not have to put these machines against each other in a future war, but with Clinton at the helm it is entirely possible and the advantages the US used to hold over the Russian military have evaporated into thin air.
Russia's Modern Approach to Warfare
During the decades-long Cold War, the Soviet Union operated under archaic rules that essentially prevented a commander, or a pilot, from knowing their mission until they were dispatched to carry out the order. Kemp Freund, a US Army sergeant major that I met while I was covering the war in Afghanistan, was Quote: d in my 2007 video report ""Camp Joyce: Remote Fire Base Near Afghanistan-Pakistan Border"" saying, ""We're trying to break the old Soviet methods that they use and the Soviet method had that Lt. Col. completely in the dark until he needed to move.‚Äù He added, ‚ÄúWe're still working with the higher echelons to get that to move downhill."" The Soviet ways were detrimental and offered little freedom to a trained soldier or pilot but all that is over now. Today's Russian pilots not only fly superior aircraft that cost far less than US taxpayer funded military planes, they also utilize tactics of Western pilots. Hillary Clinton surely knows these facts but she wants to play with fire and be another ""war president"" which was so important to former President George W. Bush, and Obama too for that matter.
Other Looming Conflicts
Lest we forget, Hillary Clinton's unwavering support of Israel, the apartheid religious nuclear state that has long been protected by US taxpayer money and military hardware. The government of right wing Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu continues to violate the human rights of Palestinians constantly, while building settlements which are completely illegal under international law. Then there are the attacks in Gaza that target schools and hospitals, leaving hundreds and hundreds dead and thousands severely injured. Never does Clinton speak out against the barbaric treatment Israel reserves for non-Jews, never does she refer to the fact that the country we now call Iran hasn't attacked a nation outside of its borders for more than three hundred years. Yet Iran has been savagely attacked by the United States both directly and indirectly. Maintaining her warmongering spirit, Clinton said, ""I want the Iranians to know that if I'm president we will attack Iran."" She added that, ""We would be able to totally obliterate them.""",1
Yemeni forces fire ballistic missile deep inside Saudi Arabia at Jeddah airport,"Yemeni army forces and allied fighters from Popular Committees have reportedly launched a locally designed and manufactured ballistic missile towards an area deep inside Saudi Arabia in response to the Riyadh regime‚Äôs atrocious aerial bombardments against the crisis-hit Arab country. 3 Shares

Yemeni soldiers and their allies fired a Borkan-1 (Volcano-1) missile towards King Abdulaziz International Airport, located 19 kilometers north of the western Saudi port city of Jeddah, Arabic-language al-Masirah television network reported.
A military source, speaking on condition of anonymity, later told the official Saba news agency that the 12.5-meter-long missile had targeted its target accurately and left massive destruction at the airport.
Saudi media outlets, however, reported that the kingdom‚Äôs missile systems intercepted and destroyed the solid propellant and Scud-type missile before it could cause any damage.
They said the projectile was launched at 9 p.m. local time (1800 GMT) on Thursday from Yemen‚Äôs mountainous northwestern area of Sa‚Äôada.
The Saudi military also claimed that the Yemeni missile was fired toward the holy city of Mecca, but the Houthi Ansarullah movement has rejected the claim.

An Eight Point Brief for Voting to Avoid Corporate Evil,"22 Shares
1 20 0 1
The anarchist political observer Noam Chomsky has over the years espoused a strategy of voting for the Democrat in swing states. Recently Chomsky, with John Halle, propounded "" An Eight Point Brief for LEV (Lesser Evil Voting) .""
Chomsky questions the ethical/moral principle rejecting LEV since lesser evil voting is designed to minimize evil. As futile as lesser evilism is, it is also futile to discuss there being a lesser evilism between the two utterly dominant rightist political parties in the United States. LEV, in fact, is an equally contemptible or greater evil.
Chomsky, though, sensibly cautions that challenges to the political-business duopoly needs to be contemplated with a full awareness of their possible consequences. What are the possible consequences? Chomsky suggests, ""A Trump presidency, should it materialize, will undermine the burgeoning movement centered around the Sanders campaign, particularly if it is perceived as having minimized the dangers posed by the far right."" However, another consequence is equally possible: a horrendous slide to the right would spur progressives to coalesce among a leftist Democrat, and/or it might finally cause former or potential Democrats to reject the chicanery of the business-dominated Democrats and embrace the progressivist platform of the Green Party.
This cost/benefit strategic accounting seriously pushes for progressivist change.
Focusing on the electoral system, however, must not be the end-all and be-all for bringing about progressivism in the US. Grassroots organizing and activism must continue to inform, oppose poverty and impoverishment, oppose war and violence, and push for human rights and equal opportunity for all people ‚Äî during electoral periods and between election cycles.

1) Voting should not be viewed as a form of personal self-expression or moral judgement directed in retaliation towards major party candidates who fail to reflect our values, or of a corrupt system designed to limit choices to those acceptable to corporate elites.
No argument with this.
2) The exclusive consequence of the act of voting in 2016 will be (if in a contested ""swing state"") to marginally increase or decrease the chance of one of the major party candidates winning.
This is true of the individual act of voting. The individual in solitude has little sway over the electoral result; that is an obvious given. However, when a consciousness sweeps across a multitude of like-minded individuals then enormous potentials emerge. This desire for a change from the effete status quo is, arguably, what occurred with the almost breakthrough candidacy of Bernie Saunders, and it is also what happened, in a dissimilar manner, with the candidacy of Donald Trump. Chomsky has framed the exclusive consequence of the act of voting as the result of an individualistic action, and it is. But individuals can and do, at times, form a wider consciousness, measurable by statistically rigorous polling results, that has potential ramifications on a much greater scale that mere margins. An example of this would be the expression of voter disgust in the Canadian federal election of 1993. Following two successive majority governments led by the Brian Mulroney Tories, a voting tsunami washed away all but two Tory seats in the 295-seat Parliament. The conservatives had been around since 1867, but the electoral demolition led to the eventual dissolution of the Tories.
3) One of these candidates, Trump, denies the existence of global warming, calls for increasing use of fossil fuels, dismantling of environmental regulations and refuses assistance to India and other developing nations as called for in the Paris agreement, the combination of which could, in four years, take us to a catastrophic tipping point. Trump has also pledged to deport 11 million Mexican immigrants, offered to provide for the defense of supporters who have assaulted African American protestors at his rallies, stated his ""openness to using nuclear weapons"", supports a ban on Muslims entering the U.S. and regards ""the police in this country as absolutely mistreated and misunderstood"" while having ""done an unbelievable job of keeping law and order."" Trump has also pledged to increase military spending while cutting taxes on the rich, hence shredding what remains of the social welfare ""safety net"" despite pretenses.
Much of what Trump stands for is anathema. True. There is no need to defend this man. However, Trump stakes out important positions diametrical to Hillary Clinton; for example, Clinton's advocacy of a no-fly zone over Syria, her saber rattling with Russia, her corporate-friendly policy toward so-called free trade deals.
Chomsky cleverly anticipated such an objection, writing:
... with respect to point 3) which some will challenge by citing the claim that Clinton's foreign policy could pose a more serious menace than that of Trump.
In any case, while conceding as an outside possibility that Trump's foreign policy is preferable, most of us not already convinced that that is so will need more evidence than can be aired in a discussion involving this statement. Furthermore, insofar as this is the fact of the matter, following the logic through seems to require a vote for Trump, though it's a bit hard to know whether those making this suggestion are intending it seriously.
First, Chomsky concedes ""an outside possibility that Trump's foreign policy is preferable..."" In other words, Chomsky posits an inside possibility (one assumes that Chomsky is saying that there is the strongest likelihood) that Clinton's foreign policy is preferable without any substantiation of why this would be so. Second, he raises an unreasonable demand for ""evidence"" that Trump will follow a less menacing foreign policy than Clinton. Given that Trump has never held political office no such evidence exists. What does exist is plenty of evidence that Clinton will pursue a menacing foreign policy. There is no reason to assume Clinton would reduce the number of American military bases overseas or curtail military spending. In fact, it is likelier that she would increase military spending. She will also likeliest resort to a US military attack to bring about ""regime change"" in Syria, pushing the US closer to military confrontation with Russia. Trump's detractors compare his bombastic rhetoric unfavorably to Clinton's rhetoric. But toward Putin or Assad, Clinton's undiplomatic utterances are on record.
Moreover, following Chomsky's logic, while the more preferable policies of Trump lack evidence, by the same token, the more objectionable policies of Trump also lack evidence for the same reason: Trump has no political track record upon which to judge what he would do if in the Oval Office. Thus, following this Chomskyian logic one could not pass judgement on hardly of Trump's pronouncements. Would he really build a wall on the Mexico-US border? Where is the evidence for this? Would Trump really ban Muslims from entering the US? Where is the evidence for this?
By effectively undermining Trump's peacemongering vis-√†-vis Clinton's warmongering, Chomsky, by the same logic, undermines criticisms of the regressivist political utterances by Trump. Thus, following Chomsky's logic through it seems a bit hard to know whether his suggestion is intended seriously.
4) The suffering which these and other similarly extremist policies and attitudes will impose on marginalized and already oppressed populations has a high probability of being significantly greater than that which will result from a Clinton presidency.
One assumes that Chomsky refers to the domestic population here. Trump's policies ‚Äî if he is true to his word to protect jobs for American workers and punish offshoring of American jobs along with his opposition to the TPP ‚Äî would be a political reversal for neoliberalization. Clintonomics would be decidedly worse for marginalized and oppressed peoples at home and abroad. The economic plight of students, the poor, and ill, however, would be much better under a Jill Stein presidency .
The economic plight of students, the poor, and ill would be much better under a Jill Stein presidency.
If Chomsky is referring to the preponderant violence of US foreign policy and its oppressive and genocidal on populations, then I agree with his ""basic moral principle"": ""not only must we take responsibility for our actions, but the consequences of our actions for others are a far more important consideration than feeling good about ourselves."" Under the Democratic administration hundreds of thousands have died, millions of people have been displaced, and terrorist organizations have proliferated. This is the evidence from Clinton's time in political office. Thus a vote for Clinton is predictably a vote that will lead to a continuation, perhaps even a ramping up, of the suffering of others. Basic morality suggests to this writer to steer clear of casting such an oppression-enabling vote.
5) Should constitute sufficient basis to voting for Clinton where a vote is potentially consequential-namely, in a contested, ""swing"" state.
I contend that Chomsky's basis for 5) is false or questionable. First, Chomsky has staunchly argued that ""we"" should concentrate foremost on the wrongful actions and crimes of our own state because they are something we can have an influence over. But it seems that Chomsky believes that Trump will supersede Clinton's record of killing in Iraq, Libya, and Syria. Clinton is not going to close US military abroad. Trump has called these bases into question. And if one concentrates on the domestic population, at least the rhetoric of Trump against so-called free trade agreements and offshoring US factories abroad bodes well for the American worker.
6) However, the left should also recognize that, should Trump win based on its failure to support Clinton, it will repeatedly face the accusation (based in fact), that it lacks concern for those sure to be most victimized by a Trump administration.
This criticism is anti-democratic; furthermore, the criticism applies conversely. Chomsky's citing the accusation gives it a veneer of credence. Effectively it leads to the perpetuation of the business-party duopoly. The records of the Bill Clinton and Barack Obama administrations demonstrate the futility of such a proffered rationale. Clinton deregulated the finance sector, exposed American workers to the vagaries of ""free trade,"" implemented regressive welfare policies, and continued aggressive US militarism abroad. Obama? Bailing out the banks; attempts to cut back social security; warring in Afghanistan, Libya, Yemen, and Syria; drone strikes; confrontation with Russia and China; TPP; and the lingering incarceration at Guantanamo Bay. It is important to note that Democrats, arguably, have a freer hand to implement rightist policy than Republicans have since many supporters of Democrats will mute their opposition to avoid providing succor to the Republicans. George Bush was stymied from tinkering with social security. Notably, Obama has done an about-face on social security and proposed an expansion, picking up on the popularity for such a measure from the Bernie Saunders candidacy.
7) Often this charge will emanate from establishment operatives who will use it as a bad faith justification for defeating challenges to corporate hegemony either in the Democratic Party or outside of it. They will ensure that it will be widely circulated in mainstream media channels with the result that many of those who would otherwise be sympathetic to a left challenge will find it a convincing reason to maintain their ties with the political establishment rather than breaking with it, as they must.
It is true that establishment operatives will use LEV as a bad faith justification for defeating challenges to corporate hegemony either in the Democratic Party or outside of it. That was the case when Ralph Nader ran. It is the case when Cynthia McKinney ran and it is when Jill Stein runs. The corporate media and even many so-called progressives will trot out this time-worn argument with each election cycle. As long as enough people buy into the premise, then the status quo will persist. The result is that a right-wing government always assumes office in Washington. This bodes ill for the poor and working class. It bodes poorly for nation states designated as enemy states by the US.
8) Conclusion: by dismissing a ""lesser evil"" electoral logic and thereby increasing the potential for Clinton's defeat the left will undermine what should be at the core of what it claims to be attempting to achieve.
Conclusion: by buying into a ""lesser evil"" electoral logic the corporate-political duopoly will remain in power to continue policies that primarily benefit the 1% and their goals for further enrichment; to unfetter finance, to pursue a belligerent foreign policy ‚Äî a policy that seeks to placate the military-industrial establishment; and to further entrench corporate domination of the electoral system. All of this is at cross-hairs with what should be at the core of what progressives claim to be attempting to achieve.
Final Comments
The tragedy of opting for lesser evilism is that the people get evil.
Some leftist commentators argue that there is no evilism . I found that to be preposterous. Barack Obama was the so-called lesser evil the previous two election cycles. Obama is not a lesser evilist; he is the man who enables evil. ... The cycles of US-backed violence and killing in places such as Gaza, Syria, Bahrain, Afghanistan, Yemen, and Somalia underscore the utter futility of pandering to a perceived lesser evilism. If one votes for a degree of evil, then one should not be surprised when evil results.
Progressivism demands that social justice activists repudiate evil. Morality dictates that people should not live in fear of being killed. A genuine peacemongering US president is needed to stop the killing and save lives. Consequently, both Democrats and Republicans are anathema. Given the present candidates, if people vote, then the only conscionable vote is for someone not of the business party factions.
Only a propeace ""third"" party will set the US on a new path . Outside of a revolution, the election of a propeace ""third"" party is the only moral direction on the horizon for Americans truly interested in steering their country toward peace and rehabilitating the ensanguined US reputation. Such a ""third party"" vote, however, may well augur the birth of a revolution on many promising fronts.",1
"Jaish Al-Fatah Leader Admits Receiving Financial, Military Aid from Saudi Arabia","Abdullah Muhammad al-Muhaysini, a senior al Qaeda-linked cleric and the religious leader of Jeish al-Fatah terrorist group, admitted that the militants in Syria have received financial and military aid from Saudi Arabia and certain other Persian Gulf Arab states. 36 Shares

According to the Syrian dissidents' news website, Enab, Muhaysini has released a video recently in which he appreciated Riyadh and other Arab states for equipping his comrades with missiles.
The Saudi preacher said that the missiles that they have sent would be used to break the Syrian army and its allies' siege of Aleppo.
He also thanked Turkey for supporting the terrorists and treating the wounded militants in its hospitals.
Jaish al-Fatah is a conglomerate of terrorist groups with Al-Nusra (Fatah Al-Sham) Front comprising its main body.
In relevant remarks in June, a source said that Saudi Arabia has sent new cargoes of weapons and financial aid to the terrorists in Aleppo in Northern Syria to strengthen them against the Syrian army and its allies' fresh attacks.

To this end, Riyadh has sent one of its ranking officers to the regions controlled by terrorists in Northern Aleppo to supply them with money and arms to intensify attacks and open new fronts against the Syrian army and popular forces, the source added.

Noting that the main cause of the terrorists' stubborn stay in Aleppo is that leaders of Fatah al-Sham (formerly known as al-Nusra Front and Ahrar al-Sham) are afraid of punishment by their Qatari, Saudi and Turkish masters, he said, ""If they move in defiance of their Qatari, Saudi and Turkish lords, they might be killed and their properties be seized.""",1

Al-Masdar News that released the footage says they are not able to independently verify it.

The tension between Kurdish fighters and Turkish government have always been high in past years. In yet one of the most recent cases, a Turkish court banned the co-leader of Turkey's pro-Kurdish opposition from traveling abroad as part of a court case in which she has been accused of being a member of an armed terrorist group, Hurriyet daily reported on Saturday, Reuters reported. 
Figen Yuksekdag, co-chair of Peoples' Democratic Party (HDP), is facing jail time up to 15 years over comments she made last year in the southeastern border town of Suruc. The prosecutor of the case requested the ban. 
HDP described the court's decision to bar Yuksekdag from foreign travel as 'political and arbitrary', saying in a statement that it will make a formal appeal for its overturn. 
The move comes days after the co-mayors of Diyarbakir, the largest city in the southeast, were detained as part of a security crackdown. Turkey's largely Kurdish southeast has been rocked by violence following the collapse of a ceasefire between the state and the Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK) last year. 
President Tayyip Erdogan has accused the HDP of being a political extension of the outlawed PKK and repeatedly called for the prosecution of its members. He has also said the removal of elected officials and civil servants accused of links to the PKK was a vital part of the battle against it. 
Several other HDP lawmakers including co-chair Selahattin Demirtas are also being prosecuted, largely over terrorism charges, after the parliament earlier this year lifted the immunity of HDP deputies, along with the immunity of MPs from other parties. 
Meanwhile three Turkish soldiers were killed and five others were wounded by mortar fire from PKK militants near the southeastern town of Cukurca, security sources said. 
Soldiers who were on an operation in Cukurca in Hakkari province bordering Iraq and Iraq returned the fire, sources said. Operations were under way to hunt down the militants.

What will Hillary Clinton do for India? Not Much and Here's Why,"Bill Clinton and his cabinet members pursued Anti-India activities and as Secretary of State Hillary did the same. As President, she will no doubt continue to bully India. 7 Shares

There are only weeks left until we find out if we have a President Trump or a President Clinton. Donald Trump is perceived as the candidate who is against the corrupt establishment, while Hillary Clinton is seen as part and fabric of the establishment and as the most corrupt candidate to run for President in the history of the country.
A President Clinton in a few weeks would return us to the hostile climate towards India that we saw in the 1990s overseen by her husband. After he took office in 1993 the US relationship with India went on a considerable down-slide. For nearly a year, Clinton did not bother appointing an ambassador to India even as he went about opposing India on multiple fronts, leading to anger in the Indian establishment. Initially he was intent on disarming and weakening India by preventing access to technology and also mounted a sustained attack on the Indian economy by imposing several economic sanctions.
In 1991, Senator Joe Biden, who is now the Vice President under Barack Obama, introduced an amendment in the bill granting aid to Russia, making the aid conditional on the fact that Russia could not sell cryogenic engines for India's space programme. The Clinton administration was hellbent on hurting the development of India's space and technology sectors and blocked the sale of Cray supercomputers that had been approved under the Ronald Reagan administration. India was also targeted for several economic sanctions and was threatened under what was called the Super 301 clause of the American trade law.
These economic sanctions were specifically borne out in the way Mr Clinton attacked the Indian textile and carpet industries. Throughout the 1990s, the terms ""Dunkel Draft"", ""Super 301"", ""WTO"" and ""patent laws"" became synonyms for the US attempts to retard the Indian economy and led to many protests in India.
By 1996, India was justified in believing that Indo-US relations had hit the lowest point, but things took a dramatic turn for the worse during Bill Clinton's second term in office. Madeleine Albright became the new Secretary of State and she was increasingly hostile to India especially through her pseudo-racist television outbursts. In fact she loved attacking India so much she went at it after leaving office and called for a plebiscite in Kashmir, justifying the actions of violent groups in the process.
MORE... Clinton's Policies Look Like a Death Sentence for Americans 10 Things to Expect with a Hillary Clinton Presidency Hillary Clinton must be indicted How Hillary Clinton ushered in a one party dictatorship of monopoly capital Remember this is the same blood-soaked Albright who advocated bombing Yugoslavia and then got her investment firm to attempt a takeover of mines in that country. Like the Clintons, she also knows how to abuse her power. Lest we forget, Albright also justified the deaths of half a million Iraqi children and claimed that the deaths were ""worth it"". And the icing on the cake for this particularly nasty woman? Albright has already threatened women in America and claimed that there was a special place in hell reserved for them if they did not vote for Hillary Clinton.
There is already talk of Joe Biden in the frame as Secretary of State under Hillary Clinton. Biden would continue his anti-India agenda and try to thwart the development of India's space programme and other technological advancements. Then of course there is Hillary's closest confidante, a duplicitous lady called Huma Abedin who is of Pakistani descent and whose family has links to radical elements in Pakistan and Saudi Arabia. Abedin could end up playing an important role in determining American foreign policy and would be certainly anti-Modi.
Another point against Hillary Clinton is that the hawkish Henry Kissinger has supports her and her oeuvre as Secretary of State. This is the same Kissinger who is so hostile against India, many of his racist statements are even on tape to that end.
It is in the light of this setting that many Indian-Americans have opposed the candidacy of Hillary Clinton and have come out in support of Donald Trump. In contrast to the policies of the Clintons, Trump has promised to make India the best friend of the US and has stated that he looks forward to working with Prime Minister Narendra Modi. Trump has also reached out to Hindus in US. While there is always a risk of the unknown and it is not clear if Trump can make the change he wants to, a Hillary presidency will certainly be a major step back for India.
In order for India to build a constructive relationship with US, it requires people in both countries to have good intentions. It is clear that India cannot have a strong and forward looking relationship with the US if Hillary Clinton is running the corridors of power. On the other hand, Donald Trump has articulated the right intent and his stance holds promise for India.",1

How Grey are the White Helmets and Their Backers?,"15 Shares

While thousands of humanitarian organisations around the world are struggling fiercely with diminishing support from governments and the public, one has achieved a surprising amount of support from Western governments in a surprisingly short period of time and gained a surprising attention from mainstream media and ditto political elites: The Syrian Civil Defence or White Helmets.
Their name of course makes you think of the UN‚Äôs Blue Helmet and white is the colour of those who should be protected in harm‚Äôs way ‚Äì and the colour of innocence. However, for many years there has been an Argentinian relief organisation with the same name.
The SCD or White Helmets counts nearly 3.000 rescue workers who operate in very dangerous areas in rebel-held territories in Syria and claims that it has, in three years, rescued about 70.000 lives according to its Twitter account (or 65 per day).
Contrary to what you might think, it isn‚Äôt a Syrian organisation because Syria has its own organisation, incidentally also called Syria Civil Defence, which was established in 1953 and is registered with ICDO, the International Civil Defence Organisation , since 1972.
The White Helmets seems to have an annual budget of US$ 30 million and has raised a total support of well over US$ 100 million. And it seems that they operate exclusively in war zones in which the fighting against the Syrian government and the Syrian Arab Army takes place, i.e. in ‚Äòliberated‚Äô areas where hundreds of groups and some 80 countries, mainly NATO members, Gulf states and Saudi-Arabia, operate.
On the White Helmets‚Äô briefing page it is stated that ‚Äúfunding for their humanitarian relief work is received from the aid budgets of Japan, Denmark, the Netherlands, the United Kingdom and the United States.‚Äù
Here is how the Foreign Ministry in Copenhagen explains the roughly US$ 9 million to the White helmets from Denmark, a country that bombs in both Iraq and Syria.
Other civil society and humanitarian organisations inside Syria have not been so fortunate. You‚Äôve probably not heard that much about the Syrian Arab Red Crescent and its work ? How much/little support have they received from Western humanitarian-concerned governments? And in general, civil society organisations in Syria ‚Äì women, peace, human rights, culture, etc. ‚Äì have received nothing like US$ 100 million in a few years and no one has such a flashy media appearance as the White Helmets.
The White Helmets was started in 2013 by James Le Mesurier who seems to have tried a little of everything everywhere, including the grey zones of special forces and intelligence in virtually all NATO wars, Yugoslavia in particular. He later set up a foundation in Holland to gather the funds. Here is a recent account by Scott Ritter , former US Marine Corps intelligence officer and weapons inspector in Iraq with tremendous knowledge of things Middle East:
‚ÄúThe organizational underpinnings of the White Helmets can be sourced to a March 2013 meeting in Istanbul between a retired British military officer, James Le Mesurier‚Äîwho had experience in the murky world of private security companies and the shadowy confluence between national security and intelligence operations and international organizations‚Äîand representatives of the Syrian National Council (SNC) and the Qatari Red Crescent Society. Earlier that month, the SNC was given Syria‚Äôs seat in the Arab League at a meeting of the league held in Qatar.
At that meeting, the SNC assumed Syria‚Äôs seat, and the Arab League authorized member states to actively provide support, including arms and ammunition, to the Syrian rebels. The Qataris, working through the SNC, helped assemble for Le Mesurier $300,000 in seed money from Japan, the United States and the United Kingdom for a seven-day course designed to train and equip a 25-person rescue team, recruited by the SNC, for duty in so-called ‚Äúliberated areas‚Äù of Syria. The SNC made available a pair of Syrian activists‚ÄîRaed Saleh and Farouq Habib‚Äîto assist Le Mesurier in this work.
The group is ‚Äì as will be seen below ‚Äì treated as uncontroversial in virtually all Western mainstream media. However, there is enough material with documentation to merit caution.
If you read media reports about the White Helmets and do not see the author mention that this group‚Äôs real identity is disputed and functions controversial you can be sure that you are wasting your time with somebody who is politically incredibly naive, or gullible; someone who has not done his or her research or is knowingly part of a deceptive effort serving a one-sided political agenda.
The White Helmets definitely is an controversial NGO ‚Äì at the same time as it is (made) difficult to understand clearly what it really is.
And until the whole picture has been developed, anyone ought to be cautious with taking information about them at face value. So much must be clear given the links below.
Dual purpose?
That said, this author has not been on the ground but has studied both the pro- et contra links provided below.
Some observers draw the conclusion that the White Helmets ‚Äì Syrian Civil Defence ‚Äì is purely good guys rescuing lots of people, children in particular. The opposite advocacy claims that, all told, they are part of the terrorist groups, serve Western governments with intelligence and that their backers run political propaganda in their name and that they are simply executioners ‚Äì murderers with a human face.
But does it have to be either/or?
An alternative hypothesis could be that the White Helmets is a dual-purposeorganisation. They claim to be ordinary Syrian volunteers who came together around the idea of saving lives and are truly altruistic ‚Äúbakers, tailors, engineers, pharmacists, painters, carpenters, students and many more, the White Helmets are volunteers from all walks of life.‚Äù It could well be that some of them actually are, even a majority.
That doesn‚Äôt preclude that other elements ‚Äì not the least those operating outside Syria such as foundations, PR and marketing firms, change organisations, NATO government and NGOs are in it with less noble, war-promoting purposes.
Link collection pro et contra
Find below a link collection ‚Äì long but fascinating in its wealth of information. We bring it as a help to those seriously interested in Syria‚Äôs fate and in studying how opinions are being built by means of connected actors in a rather opaque networking structure, in how NGOs have increasingly become Near-governmental organisations and for those who do not want to sound foolish when they discuss these matters.
First some links to how the the White Helmets presents themselves. Second, some mainstream media articles in their favour of and praising it ‚Äì including some that argue that the White Helmets ought to receive the Nobel Peace Prize (which happens to be nonsense, since they don‚Äôt even remotely qualify according to the criteria in Alfred Nobel‚Äôs very clear will and the prize is not a general do-good-prize. In addition, it must be doubted that the Nobel Committee will get more persuaded by the White Helmets‚Äô ‚Äì quite immodest ‚Äì campaign in favour of their own candidacy).
Third some links to the comprehensive network of organisations, including governments, that the White Helmets seem to be part of ‚Äì and it is quite a confusing lot with absolutely no transparency ‚Äì but quite a few investigations have been carried out.

3. Organisations in the network around the White Helmets
Purpose
A social movement creation and PR company that allegedly wants to change the world, co-founded by Jeremy Heimans ‚Äì whose mainstream, politically correct background you see here . Jeremy ‚Äì of course ‚Äì began his career with the strategy consultants McKinsey & Company. He also happens to be a co-founder of
Avaaz
Avaaz means voice or song in several languages and the organisation is known by millions as a petition platform for many good/progressive causes. Avaaz has some 43 million members around the world and is thus easily the largest NGO in the world.
Avaaz has also created Purpose.com. Here Jeremy Heimans, co-founder of Avaaz too, speaks to Forbes about his background and what the two companies do.
Avaaz is very active in promoting a No-Fly Zone in Syria which it explains in a petition text with these words: ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs build a resounding global call to Obama and other leaders to stand up to Putin and Assad‚Äôs terror. This might be our last, best chance to help end this mass murder of defenceless children. Add your name.‚Äù
The sad thing is that it has learnt nothing from its own campaign for a No-Fly Zone in Libya. John Hanrahan is a former executive director of The Fund for Investigative Journalism and reporter for The Washington Post, The Washington Star, UPI and other news organisations has made this extremely interesting analysis about how odd it is that Avaaz maintains an interventionist war-agenda in spite of earlier experiences and resistance even by high-ranking militaries.
Hanrahan Quote: s Avaaz‚Äôs campaign director, former State Department official John Tye, ‚Äúthat Avaaz shows 54,000 members in Syria in a population of 23 million ‚Äì which means that even if every Avaaz member supported a no-fly zone, this would still mean that only one of every 426 Syrians had ‚Äúvoted‚Äù for one.
Avaaz spearheads ‚Äì at least in this matter ‚Äì an extreme militarist policy while ‚ÄúAvaaz is a global web movement to bring people-powered politics to decision-making everywhere‚Äù. Which people want a No-Fly Zone in Syria? Do they know it‚Äôs a violation of a sovereign state‚Äôs airspace, of international law? That it would embolden every terrorist on Syrian soil because they would get rid of the Syrian Airforce as their enemy? That it continued into regime change in both Iraq and Libya?
Many questions unanswered by this peculiar ‚Äúpeople power‚Äù organisation, more militarist than governments!
But back to Purpose.com and one of its important clients:
The Syria Campaign ‚Äì home
They maintain on their website that ‚ÄúThe Syria Campaign is fiercely independent and has accepted no money from governments, corporations or anyone directly involved in the Syrian conflict. This allows us full autonomy to advocate for whatever is needed to save lives.‚Äù But they also say that they have accepted funds from the Asfari Foundation and the Rockefeller Brothers Foundation and other anonymous donors.
The Syria Campaign also states that it is only pro-human rights and pro-freedom and takes no side. But they explain the conflict in these words:
‚ÄúThe regime of Bashar al-Assad is responsible for crushing a peaceful uprising that has led to the deaths of over 450,000 people, the displacement of over 12 million ‚Äì half the country ‚Äì and the emergence of violent, extremist groups like Isis.
Today the fighting in Syria has given way to a world war with more than eighty countries involved on all sides.
The majority of Syrians want neither Assad nor Isis. They want an end to the violence and a democratic Syria.
What is happening in Syria could be happening to any of us. No one is free until we‚Äôre all free.‚Äù
I would characterise such a presentation as side-taking wrapped in substance-free marketing jargon; a very politicised statement wearing only black-and-white.

Multi-million funded ‚Äì can‚Äôt be independent
General reasons for concern about the real identity of the White Helmets
Here are some of the reasons ‚Äì numbers not indicative of priority:
1. Huge funding by NATO/EU countries which are militarily involved.
2. A degree of political lobbying ‚Äì a very specific explanation of the conflict and how it started which points to a no-fly zone, weaponization of human rights issues and speaks strongly against the Syrian government and Russia and very critically of the UN ‚Äì that is extremely unusual for a purely humanitarian organisation.
3. Incredibly advanced public relation in terms of very professional websites, videos and PR strategy dropping the right stories and images at the right time ‚Äì quite unique for a group of ‚Äúbakers, tailors and students‚Äù etc..
‚ÄúOmram rescued from a Russian airstrike‚Äù ‚Äì From the White Helmets‚Äô homepage.
4. Too professional wordings and images, too much playing to (exploitation of) emotions, too catchy smart formulations again and again; in short, lacking every sense of genuine local quality. Too many children ‚Äì and cats ‚Äì in the images speaking to an audience with little politically consciousness but surely a good heart. In short, populist marketing also in the sense of conveying the message: Look how good we are and how evil everybody else are.
5. Guilt by association: If the White Helmets is a 100% humanitarian first responder organisation it must be extremely naive in ignoring that its integrity, credibility and noble purposes is put at risk with the specific network of organisations and governments that it has chosen to seek support from.
6. Substance versus public relation: how does a humanitarian organisation justify that millions of dollars are spent on self-promoting public relation rather than on saving more lives in such a horrific war? And taking so many photos and shoot films of its own work in the midst of massacres and bombing raids?
7. It‚Äôs very difficult to discern who actually manages the White Helmets in general and in terms of day-to-day operations. One looks in vain for something like an organisational chart secretary-general, board, executive director (although one is mentioned, Raed Saleh, whom the US has on one occasion actually denied entry into the US).
8. How come that such an innovative organisation seems to have been started in circles that have to do with oil interests, British intelligence, mercenary/military operations and interventionist/bombing countries?
9. How come it works only in rebel/terrorist/liberated areas? Could it do that without co-operation or co-ordination with some of these groups? It has been stated ‚Äì naively ‚Äì by the Right Livelihood Award Foundation that their vision is to operate also on government-controlled territory and later be a leader in re-building a new democratic post-war Syria. However, why should the sovereign state of Syria‚Äôs legitimate government accept a foreign-based and -financed civil defence territory there when it has had its own since 1953?
Perhaps we should not be that surprised?
Should we be surprised that humanitarian workers are involved in ‚Äúsomething else‚Äù and are not exclusively devoted to doing no harm and doing good for humanity?
Not really. I‚Äôve met that sort of people and organisations during the dissolution of Yugoslavia in the 1990s, among other places at the US Embassy in Zagreb where the humanitarian section people, most likely CIA operatives, after some talk with me about helping the people switched to talk about how good it would be if president Milosevic was killed.
Are humanitarian organisations ‚Äì like most other NGOs today ‚Äì highly or completely dependent on governments? Yes, most are. And they should therefore always be checked for possible moral corruption and co-optation. Many are no longer Non- but Near-governmental and behave, at minimum, politically correct or serve/promote the interests of their governments one way or the other.
Wasn‚Äôt Doctors Without Borders started by Bernard Kouchner who advocated military humanitarian intervention as an idea, did the dirty job for NATO in Kosovo and morally advocated the bombing of Libya as a ‚Äúpeace guarantee‚Äù? Here an interesting video debate with him at Oxford by Mehdi Hasan.
Should it be so surprising that ‚Äì even liberal, democratic ‚Äì governments propagandise, construct concrete stories to appeal to the human heart in us all (for a good cause) and that they regularly lie, do fear-mongering, use stereotyping and demonisation, present black-and-white narratives ‚Äì all of which serve their elites‚Äô interests and may not always be that noble in reality?
Think of the ugly shadow world of the global arms trade in which virtually all governments take part in?
Of course not. No wars would be possible without one of more of these ingredients.
Think of the ‚Äì invented ‚Äì story about the Iraqi soldiers who kicked out babies of incubators in Kuwait city ‚Äì all invented as part of the Citizens for a Free Kuwait public relations campaign which was run by American Hill & Knowlton for the Kuwaiti government.
Or, remember James Harf of the US public relations firm, Ruder and Finn , who in 1991 was hired by the Croatian and Bosnian governments as well as by the Kosovo-Albanians to create and promote an anti-Serb attitude in the Western media?
Says Harf ‚ÄúWe were able to equate Serbs to Nazis in public opinion‚Ä¶‚Äù Some kind of balance or truth didn‚Äôt interest him: ‚ÄúWe are professionals. We have got a job to do and we do it.‚Äù
If there is anything new in this field since the early 1990s it is the spectrum, the depth, the money and the intensity with which public opinion is being deceived about war and peace ‚Äì that war today is peace and peace is preserved by violence. And the de facto replacement of knowledge and texts by purpose-driven, mediatized and emotionalised ‚Äúnarratives‚Äù and images and films ‚Äì right down on you phone and into your mind.
In summary: Illusions about our goodness that feed social narcissism and the MIMAC
I do not believe that I know exactly what the whole story and the truth is about the White Helmets. But I know that quite a few things don‚Äôt feel right.
As a sociologist and peace researcher with four decades of academic and practical experience of global affairs and work in conflict zones, the word spoken by the guard Marcellus in Shakespeare‚Äôs Hamlet at Kronborg Castle in my native Denmark come to mind: ‚ÄúThere is something rotten in the state‚Ä¶‚Äù not only in the bombing state of Denmark (that supports the White Helmets) but also in the state of the ‚Äì free ‚Äì media coverage of conflicts and wars.
If, thus, you are generally sceptical of Western media coverage of wars fought by the West and specifically of the story of the White Helmets as a purely brave humanitarian organisation ‚Äì are you then automatically pro-Assad, pro-Russia or pro-bombing? If you are critical to A, must you automatically endorse everything B or C does?
Given the ‚ÄúZeitgeist‚Äù of these times, my hunch is that the anti-intellectual‚Äôs, the propagandist‚Äôs and the blamegamer‚Äôs answer is a roaring ‚ÄúYes!‚Äù Personally, I couldn‚Äôt care less but there is reason to worry about the fact that our media are not free to take up the issues dealt with here.
Pulitzer prize winner, Chris Hedges, talks about ‚Äúthe incessant manufacturing of illusions that feed social narcissism.‚Äù The ‚Äì unwinnable ‚Äì wars the West fights with the illusory ideology of spreading goodness, democracy, freedom and peace as well as the alleged good role of the White Helmets in it is little else but an expression of such an incessant manufacturing of illusions that feed social narcissism of the many while filling the pockets of the few in the Military-Industrial-Media-Academic Complex (MIMAC).
It‚Äôs time to give reality show politics and media a reality check. But who can and who will? And who dares now everything will get worse after November 8?",1
Top Aide to Hillary Clinton Urges the FBI to Disclose what it Knows about Trump's Russia Ties,"23 Shares
4 18 0 1
A top aide to Hillary Clinton urged the FBI on Tuesday to disclose what it knows about any ties between Donald Trump and Russia, accusing the agency of unfairly publicizing its inquiry into Clinton's email practices while staying quiet about the Republican presidential candidate.
The Federal Bureau of Investigation opened a preliminary inquiry in recent months into allegations that Trump or his associates might have had questionable dealings with Russian people or businesses, but found no evidence to warrant opening a full investigation, according to sources familiar with the matter. The agency has not publicly discussed the probe.
A week before Election Day, the Clinton campaign was trying to contain damage from the announcement by FBI Director James Comey on Friday that his agency was looking into newly discovered emails that might relate to Clinton's use of a private server while she was secretary of state.
Clinton has voiced confidence the FBI will not find anything problematic.
Clinton campaign manager Robby Mook questioned why the FBI director had not released any information about the agency's Russia inquiries.

Release the information on his connections to the Russians,"" Mook said on CNN.
The FBI inquiry reviewed allegations that Trump or his associates might have violated the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act or engaged in contacts or commerce with people in Russia who are subject to U.S. or international financial sanctions.
The U.S. government has blamed Russia for cyber attacks on Democratic Party organizations. Democrats criticize Trump for taking what they say is a pro-Russia foreign policy stance.
Russia's possible role in the campaign again came into focus when online magazine Slate said a group of computer scientists had been alarmed by records showing thousands of apparent connection attempts between an email server operated on behalf of the Trump Organization and computers inside a Russian company, Alfa Bank in Moscow.
Trump campaign spokeswoman Hope Hicks said the server, which had been used to send out hotel marketing material, had been dormant for years.
Prominent U.S. cyber security company FireEye said it had been hired by Alfa Bank to investigate the records and had been granted access to the bank‚Äôs systems in Moscow to look for evidence of any relationship with Trump‚Äôs company or any signs of hacking or infection. FireEye said so far it had found no emails being sent back and forth or any other link.",1

"Iranians Spend $2.1b on Beauty Products Annually, 3 Times more than Their European Counterparts","11 Shares

Iranians spend 4.5% of their annual earnings on beauty products, three times more than their European counterparts, as per official statistics. The Germans spend 1.5% and the French and British 1.7% of their income every year on cosmetics.
According to data from the Iranian Association of Cosmetics, Toiletries and Perfumery Importers, Iran accounts for $2.1 billion of the Middle East‚Äôs $7.2 billion beauty products market‚Äìsecond in the region after Saudi Arabia, the Persian daily Shahrvand reported.
It is said that there are 15 million consumers for cosmetic products in Iran. Dividing the annual turnover by this number shows that each consumer spends $140 on cosmetics per year. Germany‚Äôs online statistics portal (Statista) states that the per capita cosmetic spending in Europe is ‚Ç¨90 ($99) on average. The index is $173.5 in Germany, $176 in France, $177 in Britain, $169 in Italy and $150 in Spain.
If the raw figures alone are taken, Iranians spend less than Europeans on make-up products. But the results change as other parameters such as the price of products and household average earnings are taken into account as well.
As confirmed by the Iranian Association of Cosmetics, Toiletries and Perfumery Importers, 70% of the cosmetics in the market are smuggled into the country and often sold at a lower price than they would be if they were legally imported, not to mention the health risks contraband products are likely to pose. Europeans on the other hand pay the real price of the products which includes tax and are thus more expensive.

Moreover, the spending has to be measured as compared to the average earnings. Based on Gallup Incorporation‚Äôs opinion polls, Iranians‚Äô median per capita income has been estimated as $3,100 while that of the Germans, French and British $14,000, $12,500 and $12,300 respectively. The Spanish and Italians earn $6,800 and $7,200.
This means that Iranians spend 4.5% of their income on beauty products while the figure is 1.5% for Germans, 1.7% for the French and British, 3% for Italians and 2.5% for the Spanish.
These calculations show that people in Iran spend three times as much on cosmetics as German, French and British consumers.
 Cosmetic Surgery
Additionally, Iran‚Äôs Oral and Maxillofacial Surgeons‚Äô Association has announced that 80,000 cosmetic surgeries are performed each year constituting 0.3% of the operations in the world. This is a rather large percentage given that only 1.08% of the world population lives in Iran. Besides, the figure is said to be approximate due to the absence of an official registration system and the fact that other types of beauty surgeries such as body contouring and facial rejuvenation, among many others, are not included.
Data from the Central Bank and the Statistics Center of Iran suggest that cultural pursuits constitute a small portion of Iranian household expenditure. The reports indicate that each family spent only 2% of their income on recreation and cultural activities in 2015, less than half their expenses on cosmetic products.
Iran‚Äôs share of the world book market is 0.1% which is one-third the country‚Äôs share of the cosmetics market. The $2.1 billion incurred on beauty products is said to equal Japan‚Äôs cinema turnover and exceeds that of Bollywood and the UK‚Äôs film industry.
Culture, cinema and books don‚Äôt comprise high-income businesses in Iran while cosmetic surgeons and beauty product dealers make fortunes on their business.",1
A New Email Investigation on Clinton Could Hasten the Democratic Party's Demise,"20 Shares
1 18 0 1
The two-party corporate duopoly remains mired in crisis in the closing days of the 2016 Presidential elections. Donald Trump's virtual hijacking of the Republican Party has stripped the competition between the two dominant sections of the ruling class down to its most naked form. The corporate media's non-stop coverage of Trump was supposed to legitimize the candidacy of Hillary Clinton and rake in enormous profits for the monopoly outlets. The eyes of the rich have been on Hillary Clinton to rescue the two-party system from the danger of Donald Trump. However, thanks to WikiLeaks, Hillary Clinton appears poised to take the Democratic Party down its own path of destruction.
The FBI announcement that it will reopen the investigation of Clinton's private email server has significantly eroded the momentum of the Democratic Party campaign. Trump appeared finished by the end of the third Presidential debate. His campaign was mired in sexual assault allegations and media inquiries into possible tax evasion. The billionaire white nationalist has suddenly found himself within one point of Hillary Clinton in recent polls. No matter how many traps Trump falls into or how vile his campaign rhetoric, Clinton has proven that no amount of Trump debauchery can save her from her political record.
Unfortunately, the email scandal has been subject to the limitations of corporate media coverage. The threat to ""national security"" has been cited as the number one issue with Clinton's breach of State Department privacy. Indeed, Clinton did break the law and from this framework it is no doubt appropriate that she face the consequences. But under imperialism, where billions of people are exploited for the profits of monopoly corporations, the legitimacy of ruling class law is of little worth to the vast majority of humanity. What matters is the content of the emails themselves. The emails reveal that the current conditions of the imperialist system have thrown the two-party system into a permanent crisis of legitimacy.
The first batch of emails dumped by WikiLeaks exposed how US imperialism serves the masters of war and capital. The initial emails proved that Clinton destabilized Libya in 2011 in order to stop the Gaddafi-led government from instituting an independent gold currency across the African continent . The emails also exposed that the Democratic National Committee (DNC) spent copious amounts of time deriding the Sanders campaign . Another batch of emails further damaged the Clinton cache with contents from her speeches to the big banks. It was in these speeches where she told Wall Street that she takes a different position in public than she does in private. In private, Clinton serenaded the ears of the rich with her desires to privatize Social Security and create a ""hemispheric common market.""
The emails have not been the only development that has soured Clinton's election campaign. The Obama Administration announced in late October that premiums for the Affordable Care Act market-based exchanges are set to increase by 25 percent next year . Bill Clinton also made negative headlines through a leaked memo that revealed the former President utilized the Clinton Foundation to make profitable deals with private corporations . In other words, the Democratic Party has been unable to avoid looking like the corporate servant and imperialist party it always has been. With less than a month left until voting day, a Clinton victory is anything but secure.
MORE... The banana republic of America: Democracy be damned To the Superdelegates: Stand tall in statesmanship! Anointment of Hillary Clinton exposes a democracy that never was Democratic Party ignored its 2012 platform There are some in the US who believe that the demise of the Democratic Party will be a bad thing. Clinton has fewer staunch supporters among working people than she does individuals who are willing to hold their nose for Clinton in order to avoid a Trump Presidency. However, the stench emanating from the Clinton camp is becoming unbearable. Her campaign's reliance on anti-Putin Russophobia threatens World War. Her policy record is equally, if not more deplorable, than Donald Trump's capitalist, racist, and misogynistic machinations. The new email investigation could be the first nail of many to come in the Democratic Party coffin.
However, the fear of Trump is deeply embedded into the psyche of a large section of American voters. The corporate media has constantly fed many of her lies and suspicions to the masses. One of these myths is the alleged WikiLeaks-Russia-Trump alliance. No such alliance exists. Neither Putin nor WikiLeaks has announced any sort of allegiance to Trump. Putin has simply commented on Trump's advocacy of a US-Russian partnership was a ""smart"" thing to say. Furthermore, Julian Assange has denied publicly that Trump would somehow present a better option than Hillary Clinton. But the truth matters little in a political environment that equates opposition to Clinton with support for Trump.
Clinton has turned the Russian blame game toward the FBI. In a campaign speech, Clinton insinuated that the FBI is hiding information regarding the Putin-Trump alliance. Her claims were promptly proved false . Such remarks may cause more damage to an already unpopular campaign. US intelligence agencies are powerful institutions that current and future Presidents must curry the favor of to achieve the objectives of US imperialism. When President John F. Kennedy signaled that he wanted to break the CIA into a ""thousand pieces,"" he was assassinated shortly thereafter. It was revealed last year that the CIA was heavily involved in the cover-up of its involvement in his murder. US intelligence is thus the wrong crowd for a future US President to anger, especially given the vast surveillance apparatus now at its disposal.
Speculation aside, the Clinton campaign emails present useful information on the depth of US imperialism‚Äôs crisis. US imperialism has been mired in a period of stagnant economic growth and endless war for decades. It was only a matter of time before this crisis would express itself through its electoral system. Never has it been clearer that the two corporate parties in front of US imperial policy work solely for the ruling class. The task now is to utilize the developments of this election cycle in service of the people. That means shedding all fear of what the results of the election will be and basing our action on principles instead.",1
Why Palestinians Want to Sue Britain: 99 Years since the Balfour Declaration,"9 Shares
8 0 0 1
Last July, the Palestinian Authority took the unexpected, although belated step of seeking Arab backing in suing Britain over the Balfour Declaration. That ‚Äòdeclaration‚Äô was the first ever explicit commitment made by Britain, and the West in general, to establish a Jewish homeland atop an existing Palestinian homeland.
It is too early to tell whether the Arab League would heed the Palestinian call , or if the PA would even follow through, especially considering that the latter has the habit of making too many proclamations backed by little or no action.
However, it seems that the next year will witness a significant tug of war regarding the Balfour Declaration, the 100th anniversary of which will be commemorated on November 02, 2017 .
But who is Balfour, what is the Balfour Declaration and why does all of this matters today?
Britain's Foreign Secretary from late 1916, Arthur James Balfour, had pledged Palestine to another people. That promise was made on November 02, 1917 on behalf of the British government in the form of a letter sent to the leader of the Jewish community in Britain, Walter Rothschild.
MORE... Palestine‚Äôs reality: Al Nakba commemoration and the right of return or the return of the Faisal-Weizmann Agreement? To be a child in Palestine, where Israel has killed more children than the total number of goals scored in all FIFA World Cups Let There Be Water: Israel's policy of stolen water No hope and no heroes for Palestine At the time, Britain was not even in control of Palestine, which was still part of the Ottoman Empire. Either way, Palestine was never Balfour‚Äôs to so casually transfer to anyone else. His letter read:
‚ÄúHis Majesty's government view with favour the establishment in Palestine of a national home for the Jewish people, and will use their best endeavours to facilitate the achievement of this object, it being clearly understood that nothing shall be done which may prejudice the civil and religious rights of existing non-Jewish communities in Palestine, or the rights and political status enjoyed by Jews in any other country.‚Äù
He concluded, ‚ÄúI should be grateful if you would bring this declaration to the knowledge of the Zionist Federation.‚Äù
Balfour was hardly acting on his own. True, the Declaration bears his name, yet, in reality, he was a loyal agent of an Empire with massive geopolitical designs, not only concerning Palestine alone, but with Palestine as part of a larger Arab landscape.
Only a year earlier, another sinister document was introduced, albeit secretly. It was endorsed by another top British diplomat, Mark Sykes and, on behalf of France, by Fran√ßois Georges-Picot. The Russians were informed of the agreement, as they too had received a piece of the Ottoman cake.
The document indicated that, once the Ottomans were soundly defeated, their territories, including Palestine, would be split among the prospective victorious parties.
The Sykes-Picot Agreement , also known as the ‚ÄòAsia Minor Agreement‚Äô, was signed in secret one hundred years ago, two years into World War I. It signified the brutal nature of colonial powers that rarely associated land and resources with people who lived upon or owned them.
The centerpiece of the agreement was a map that was marked with straight lines by a China graph pencil. The map largely determined the fate of the Arabs, dividing them in accordance with various haphazard assumptions of tribal and sectarian lines.
The improvised map consisted not only of lines but also colors , along with language that attested to the fact that the two countries viewed the Arab region purely on materialistic terms, without paying the slightest attention to the possible repercussions of slicing up entire civilizations with a multifarious history of co-operation and conflict.
The Sykes-Picot negotiations were completed in March 1916 and, although official, was secretly signed on May 19, 1916.
WWI concluded on November 11, 1918, after which the division of the Ottoman Empire began in earnest.
British and French mandates were extended over divided Arab entities, while Palestine was granted to the Zionist movement a year later, when Belfour conveyed the British government‚Äôs promise, sealing the fate of Palestinians to a life of perpetual war and turmoil.
Rarely was British-Western hypocrisy and complete disregard for the national aspiration of any other nation on full display as in the case of Palestine. Beginning with the first wave of Zionist Jewish migration to Palestine in 1882, European countries helped facilitate the movement of illegal settlers and resources, where the establishment of many colonies, large and small, was afoot.
So when Balfour sent his letter to Rothschild, the idea of a Jewish homeland in Palestine was very much plausible.
Still, many supercilious promises were being made to the Arabs during the Great War years, as the Arab leadership sided with the British in their war against the Ottoman Empire. Arabs were promised instant independence, including that of the Palestinians.
When the intentions of the British and their rapport with the Zionists became too apparent, Palestinians rebelled , marking a rebellion that has never ceased 99 years later, and highlighting the horrific consequences of British colonialism and the eventual complete Zionist takeover of Palestine which is still felt after all of these years.
Paltry attempts to pacify Palestinian anger were to no avail, especially after the League of Nations Council in July 1922 approved the terms of the British Mandate over Palestine ‚Äì which was originally granted to Britain in April 1920 ‚Äì without consulting the Palestinians at all. In fact, Palestinians would disappear from the British and international radar, only to reappear as negligible rioters, troublemakers, and obstacles to the joint British-Zionist colonial concoctions.
Despite occasional assurances to the contrary, the British intention of ensuring the establishment of an exclusively Jewish state in Palestine was becoming clearer with time. The Balfour Declaration was not merely an aberration, but had, indeed, set the stage for the full-scale ethnic cleansing that followed, three decades later.
In fact, that history remains in constant replay: the Zionists claimed Palestine and renamed it ‚ÄòIsrael‚Äô; the British continue to support them, although never ceasing to pay lip-service to the Arabs; and the Palestinian people remain a nation that is geographically fragmented between refugee camps, in the diaspora, militarily occupied, or treated as second class citizens in a country upon which their ancestors dwelt since time immemorial.
While Balfour cannot be blamed for all the misfortunates that have befallen Palestinians since he communicated his brief, but infamous letter, the notion that his ‚Äòpromise‚Äô embodied - that of complete disregard of the aspirations and rights of the Palestinian Arab people ‚Äì that very letter is handed from one generation of British diplomats to the next, in the same way that Palestinian resistance to colonialism has and continues to spread across generations.
That injustice continues, thus the perpetuation of the conflict. What the British, the early Zionists, the Americans and subsequent Israeli governments failed to understand, and continue to ignore at their own peril, is that there can be no peace without justice and equality in Palestine; and that Palestinians will continue to resist, as long as the reasons that inspired their rebellion nearly a century ago, remain in place.",1

The B'nai Brith immediately publicized the offensive content of the post to introduce a concerted smear and disinformation campaign implying falsely that Dr. Hall seeks to ""Kill All Jews."" The B'nai Brith exploited its grotesque misrepresentation of Dr. Hall's academic work to call on its membership to flood the administrative offices of the University of Lethbridge with letters and petition signatures. The object is to remove Dr. Hall from his teaching post. Dr. Hall remains a tenured full professor whose career as a university teacher began in 1982.
The University of Lethbridge's administration soon surrendered to this Zionist campaign aimed at disabling an outspoken critic of Israel's genocidal treatment of the Aboriginal Palestinians. On Oct. 4 the U of L president, Dr. Mike Mahon, suspended Dr. Hall without pay. He undertook this assault on the principles of academic freedom in the complete absence of any due process of third-party arbitration whatsoever.
The attack on Dr. Hall is an attack on the institution of academic tenure, a mainstay of protection for academic freedom in institutions of higher learning. The University of Lethbridge Faculty Association and the Canadian Association of University Teachers have identified the illegal nature of Dr. Mahon's unprecedented assault on the core principles of tenure and academic freedom.
In his talk sponsored by the Mohawks of the Grand River, Dr. Hall put the Zionist/Facebook campaign directed at disabling critics of Israel in a broader historical context. The assault on the Palestinian people extends the genocidal holocaust directed at the Indigenous peoples of the Americas since 1492. Israeli techniques directed at terminating the Palestinian presence draw on the genocidal techniques directed at Native Americans in the expansionary course of US history.

"Shall We Save Civilization, or Not? - American Herald Tribune","2 Shares

It looks as though civilization is under attack. Fundamentalists of various stripes, survivalists, and certain ideologues seem to be, at worst, determined to bring about its collapse. Worst of all, to my mind, the general population gazes upon the looming demise of civilization with an apparent indifference that is astonishing.
Scientifically, the exact process by which civilization got started is not known. It is known to have something to do with the development of farming.
Even the Bible endorses that, for those who know the story of Cain, the farmer who killed his brother Abel and is credited with building the world's first city. (Technically, ""civilization"" means ""living in cities."") Also, any estimated age of Earth that I have seen that was calculated using the Bible (which calculations always start with Cain's parents, Adam and Eve) has turned out to be a fair-to-excellent estimate of the age of civilization.
At any rate, farming made relatively large surpluses of food possible. That allowed for the existence of significant numbers of people who were not concerned with procuring food, other than to own a farm, buy food, or, in the case of slaves, have it provided by their owners.
There is no doubt that slavery was present from the beginning of civilization. My theory is that groups of warrior-like people offered farmers protection from raiders in exchange for food. Then they realized that they could turn their enterprise into a protection racket, in which they extorted most of the food from the farmers. Before long, they realized that maximum efficiency would be achieved by simply enslaving the farmers.
The enslavers also used slaves to build fortresses. Those fortresses became the seed crystals of cities, where people could live and be protected from the worst the world had to offer by submitting to the local tyrant.
As local tyrants conquered more territory their wealth grew and so did their cities. The Roman Empire was the apotheosis of that process.
[Serfdom, the slightest possible moral improvement over slavery, was the basis of feudalism, which technically was not civilization because it was not predicated on the existence of cities.]
Civilization is now threatened with extinction. It might not be much morally, but materially it is all we've got. Civilization as we know it does at least protect the farmers without extorting or enslaving them.
If civilization were to collapse there is no doubt that some human beings in small groups would be able to scratch out a subsistence existence here and there. Life would surely be, as Thomas Hobbes would say, ""nasty, brutish, and short,"" but human life would continue in some form.
Or, we can make the effort to save civilization. If we want to avoid the worst, we have to start immediately.
The primary threat to civilization is a material threat. It is a scythe aimed at the legs upon which civilization has always stood: farming.
The threat is global warming. The temperature of the air and the water on surface of this planet is increasing.
People who deny that global warming is happening are being irrational. I don't endorse locking them up, but I do endorse ignoring them while those of us who are not irrational (in that way, anyway) get on with saving civilization.
For as long as civilization has existed, Earth has had a stable-enough climate that has supported large-scale agriculture. Now that is changing.
Some people seem to think that we can simply shift crops northward to suit the new temperatures. That would be wrong.
Global warming will create such climatic dislocations that agriculture as we know it will cease to exist. If agriculture as we know it ceases to exist, civilization will cease to exist.
The ultimate cause of global warming is beside the point. Arguing about that is like standing in the yard while one's house is on fire, arguing with one's spouse about the cause of the blaze. As the late, great Gene Wilder would doubtlessly say, eyes and hair equally wild, The... HOUSE... is on... FIRE . PUT... the FIRE ... OUT !
Whatever is the cause of global warming, we only have one response available to us. We have to reduce the amount of carbon dioxide and other heat-trapping gases being disgorged into the atmosphere.
One big thing we can do immediately is to turn off our air conditioners wherever that is at all feasible. (Modern high-rises don't permit it, but it can be done everywhere else.) Fans consume a small fraction of the electricity that air conditioners do. It is a great irony that burning mountains of coal to make ourselves cooler has contributed to getting us into this mess, but there you go.
The survival of civilization depends upon stopping global warming... now! If we fail to do that, civilization is kaput.",1
Iraqi Soldier Battling in Mosul Reunited with His Family After Two Years of Estrangement,"14 Shares

It's a heartwarming moment amid the carnage of the battle to liberate Mosul.
An Iraqi lieutenant -- part of the elite Golden Division special forces fighting to take back Iraq's second city from ISIS -- was stationed at a checkpoint in Bartella, about 25 kilometers to the east of the city, when he spotted some familiar faces Tuesday.
Amid a group of refugees fleeing the city's outskirts were his mother, his father, and his nephew, whom the soldier had been separated from for over two years.
The soldier gave his name as 1st. Lt. Salam to the CNN producer who captured the moment.
After embracing a group of adults, including his mother, father and brother, he picks up his young nephew and holds him, walking away from the group. He then falls to his knees and kisses him, before picking him up and carrying him away. The joy on both their faces obvious to all.

,"The article explains a lot of the background to the White Helmets and asks some important questions about the relations between government and NGO's, or as the author terms them 'Near-Government Organisations. The author should also be commended for the extensive bibliography.
The author suggests that the truth about the White Helmets may lie somewhere in the middle, that the White Helmets is a dual-purpose organisation with both humanitarian and propaganda functions.
The author offers no evaluation of the video evidence provided by the White Helmets, which to a number of people seems incontrovertably fake and staged. If this video evidence is indeed faked, then it invites the question: why is this necessary? where are all the real casualties? Hasn't the Russian bombing killed any civilians at all?
""The SCD or White Helmets counts nearly 3,000 rescue workers"" This claim comes only from the White Helmets. It could well be that the Foreign Office is paying for 3,000 salaries, but whether those drawing
them are occupied in full-time humanitarian work is another matter.
After watching carefully the dubious video footage of rescue scenes, and the far more convincing footage of White Helmets participating in torture and abuse of prisoners, it is difficult to see how the White
Helmets are anything more than a set of expensive props and uniforms, provided to extremist groups in Aleppo and Idlib and donned for propaganda purposes, or when other uniforms are in the wash.
Furthermore, given that the White Helmets are funded by the governments and organisations who are totally unmoved by the plight of civilians in the greater part of Syria, the idea that these bodies would pay for humanitarian duties on the part of the White Helmets seems somewhat optimistic.
If the White Helmets are have a dual-purpose function, it is not propagandist-humanitarian, but propagandist-terrorist.
I would also take issue with the statement 'The sad thing is that [Avaaz] has learned nothing from its own campaign for a No-Fly Zone in Libya'. This view, like the idea that the US etc keep making 'mistakes', is 'following a mistaken policy', presupposes that Avaaz is well-intentioned, that it opposes the destruction of Iraq, Libya, Syria (Iran, Russia ...)",1
Clinton's Blitzkrieg Campaign: the Savage Politics of the Oligarchs,"It doesn't matter what the friggin' legal and ethics people say. We need to win this motherfucker. -- Mr. Scott Foval, Field Director, Americans United for Change, retained by the Clinton campaign and the Democratic National Committee 107 Shares
2 104 0 1
An elite stratum of wealthy and politically dominant people intends to make Hillary Clinton our next president. These are the oligarchs, the ‚Äú1%‚Äù whose wealth and incomes continue growing while most American struggle. In her private life Hillary Clinton is well-positioned among this cohort, and they expect her as President to protect their wealth and maintain their dominance. She will.
To assure the oligarchs' success, the Democratic National Committee is brutalizing the presidential electoral process, willfully violating rules, laws, and precedent. The strategy succeeded in the primary elections, and it will win the general.
Who are these people? The top 1% of wealth-holders numbers about 3.25 million. Predominantly they are citizens whose wealth depends on the huge American domestic and transnational corporations, either directly‚Äîexecutives, directors, investors, contractors, suppliers‚Äîor indirectly in other ways (e.g. investment bankers, hedge fund managers, consultants, top law firms). Two preeminent names in this grouping are Hillary and Bill Clinton, whose net worth (about $125 million) qualifies the couple for the 1% stratum by a factor of 16. Others are Wall Street bankers‚Äîthe Clintons' primal financial benefactors and first-name friends: Lloyd Blankfein, Jamie Dimon, Robert Rubin, Brian Moynihan, Michael Corbat, James Gorman, Timothy Geithner, John Stumpf, etc. A more accurate description of the ‚Äú1%‚Äù would be the corporate elite .
Candidate Clinton's relationship to her elite compatriots is one of rigid interdependence: she needs their financial and political resources to win the election, and they need her in the White House to sustain their privileged status.
This privileged status did not result from accident, random chance, or neglect. It is a consequence of public policies consciously adopted over the past three or four decades which shift wealth and incomes systematically upward. (Cutting taxes for corporations and the wealthy, for example, while exporting 1/3 of the nation's manufacturing jobs.) In the process our democracy was transformed. Public policy is crafted today not primarily to advance the welfare of the nation's people, but to create, protect or enhance the financial interests of American corporate enterprise. This is acknowledged in the statements of public figures and supported in rigorous scholarly research. [1]
MORE... A New Email Investigation on Clinton Could Hasten the Democratic Party's Demise The banana republic of America: Democracy be damned To the Superdelegates: Stand tall in statesmanship! Anointment of Hillary Clinton exposes a democracy that never was Though easily identifiable, the corporate elite has not constructed a conscious conspiracy against the American people at large with a preplanned agenda, strategy, and tactics. But they share a common mindset, they are networked by personal acquaintance, and they are driven by a common imperative. Their wealth and political dominance depend on the existing configurations of American domestic and foreign policy, both of which must be maintained essentially intact to sustain the group's position of privilege. Alterations in the status quo can be tolerated only if they are cosmetic, slight, and at the margin.
Instead of conspiracy, the preeminence of the oligarchs is better seen as a malignant condition of contemporary American government, resulting from years of institutional decay and corruption. ( The story of moribund democracy is detailed here .) The economic and political power of mega-corporations‚Äîincreasingly fewer but ever larger‚Äîhas displaced functional democracy.
(Yes, we vote as we always have, but voting and democracy are not interchangeable terms. The Russian people voted for Vladimir Putin, the Iraqis voted for Saddam Hussein. And voting isn't a prerequisite for democracy to function: the ancient Greeks chose their representatives by lottery.)
The priority of corporate interests has been achieved by three powerful mechanisms.
Perhaps the least recognized is the degree to which corporate personnel enter government to staff the highest levels of the Executive Branch.
A new book by political scientists Bastiaan van Apeldoorn and Nana de Graaff carries a sobering title: American Grand Strategies and Corporate Elite Networks . They looked into the ‚Äúgrand strategy makers,‚Äù the 30 most influential people in cabinet-level and senior advisory positions in the last three administrations‚ÄîBill Clinton's, Bush's, and Obama's. In the Clinton Administration, 25 of the 30 ‚Äúgrand strategy makers‚Äù (83%) were linked to 197 different transnational or financial corporations, as executives, directors, senior associates, or partners in law firms, either prior to their public service or after it. In the Bush Administration 27 of the 30 (90%) had connections to 157 corporations. In the Obama Administration 23 of the 30 (over 70%) had such ‚Äútop-level corporate affiliations‚Äù with 111 companies.
Smoking guns? Examples of wealth-shifting upward to the already rich? Certainly. (1) The repeal of the Glass-Steagall Act, rammed through in the Bill Clinton Administration by Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin from Citigroup. This enabled the subprime loan frenzy, enriching the New York banks but destroying $13 trillion in Americans' household wealth. (2) Halliburton's no-bid, obscenely profitable contracts in Iraq, served up by Vice President Richard Cheney during the Bush Administration; billions of taxpayers' dollars to the corporation Mr. Cheney once chaired. (3) In the Obama Administration Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner from Wall Street administered the Troubled Asset Relief Program, bailing out his colleagues' banks, again with billions of taxpayers' money.
For the last 24 years the Executive Branch has been dominated by the corporate elite.
Two other mechanisms of corporate influence are far more familiar: the corporate financing of political campaigns and the ubiquitous enterprise of lobbying.
The two practices are related in direct proportion: the more you accept in contributions from Boeing, say, the more you feel obligated to yield to their lobbyist's wishes.
Your policy-making independence will decrease, then, as the costs of campaigning rise, and contemporary costs are staggering. A Representative today must raise on average $1.7 million in campaign funding, a Senator $10.5 million. A presidential race runs in the hundreds of millions. (Hillary Clinton has taken in $688 million.) Since Citizens United corporate campaign funding has no limits, and with candidates in need of so many millions, the corporate capture of federal governance is undeniable and scarcely surprising.
Undeniable but easily surmounted. We once had a law on the books (the UK still does) limiting not campaign contributions, but campaign expenditures. The limits were $10,000 for a Senate race, $5,000 for a Representative, sums easily provided from personal assets and those of family and friends. Reenacting such a law would break the corporate stranglehold; intense lobbying might continue, but no Senator, no Representative would feel the courteous urge to accommodate. The welfare of the American people could regain priority. The impact on the oligarchs, however, would be apocalyptic.
The commitment of the corporate elite to sustain the status quo is apparently absolute. By April of 2015 the Democratic National Committee and the Clinton campaign were one indistinguishable juggernaut, intent on blitzing the presidential campaign like Hitler's Wehrmacht stormed through Europe. The watch words seemed to be ‚Äúfirst and most.‚Äù They amassed an early war-chest of a hundred million dollars or so and lined up 400 superdelegate endorsements‚Äîall before there was a single announced opponent. They invited 65 print and television journalists to meetings in early April, to help in ‚Äúframing the HRC message and framing the race.‚Äù [2] Among them were George Stephanoplous and 4 others from ABC; Rachel Maddow and 4 more from MSNBC; Gloria Borger and 7 of her colleagues from CNN; and 5 from the New York Times. Bloomberg, Politico, and CBS each sent along two.
The first-and-most strategy worked. Secretary Clinton preempted the candidate space; the only others attracted to the race were lackluster lightweights, especially the wooly socialist from Vermont. But Senator Sanders' electrifying rallies made tangible the disgust of the American people with the status quo . Sanders' proposals were anything but cosmetic, slight, and at the margin: they posed a mortal threat to the corporate elite and its guardian, the Clinton campaign. To minimize Sanders' exposure, DNC Chair Wasserman-Schultz limited the number of debates and scheduled them on weekends and opposite football games. Sanders had to sue to gain access to the DNC's voter database. The deliberate tilting of the Democratic primaries gained momentum.
To minimize Sanders' exposure, DNC Chair Wasserman-Schultz limited the number of debates and scheduled them on weekends and opposite football games.
This may not be the first election in which ethics and law were abandoned, but never before has it been so reliably exposed.
Not by the mainstream media, though. They either ignored the increasingly evident fraud or were complicit in it. From the Iowa caucuses onward, the press treated Clinton's superdelegate endorsements as tallied votes. This continued even after the distortion and dishonesty of doing so were pointed out. Based on precisely that deception, however, the Associated Press announced Clinton's presumptive nomination on Monday, June 6‚Äîone day before primaries were held in California, Montana, New Jersey, North and South Dakota, and the District of Columbia. From Iowa forward also the Washington Post and the New York Times hammered the Sanders campaign without mercy or interruption. (The story was detailed later by Thomas Frank in Harper's Magazine . [3] Frank concludes: I have never before seen the press take sides like they did this year, openly and even gleefully bad-mouthing candidates who did not meet with their approval .)
No, the major media failed to expose the fraud, but the social media and the Internet abounded with skepticism. Sanders fans questioned the uncounted caucuses in Iowa; the 70% reduction of polling places in Maricopa County, Arizona; the disqualified Sanders delegates at the Nevada convention; the cheap-shot call by the Associated Press. Many were certain the Clinton campaign and the Democratic National Committee were joined at the hip, but there was scant factual evidence.
Enter Julian Assange and the leaked DNC emails. Now the illegal collusion was documented, the sabotaging of the Sanders campaign exposed. Wasserman-Schultz resigns as DNC chair. Then the Podesta emails and Hillary's paid speeches: ‚Äúyou need both a public position and a private position.‚Äù ‚ÄúMy dream is a hemispheric open market, with open trade and open borders.‚Äù DNC vice-chair Donna Brazile, a CNN pundit, emails the Clinton campaign prior to the debate: ‚ÄúFrom time to time I get the questions in advance.‚Äù The attempt to reschedule the Illinois primary. Another tranche of emails arrives: Brazile's complicity with the Clinton campaign is broadened, she is fired/resigns from her CNN post. The Clinton Foundation hosts pay to play, the Clintons' personal enrichment, the $12 million deal with King Mohammed VI of Morocco....
Finally the compliant mass media did take note: this is, after all, fine spectacle. Noted but not pursued. No determined effort was undertaken to investigate, to document further the deceit and dishonesty, and to assess its magnitude.
Once again that was left to the citizenry. The first careful, detailed study was published June 7, 2016 by two scholars, Axel Geijel of Tilburg University and Rodolfo Cortes Barragan at Stanford. It is entitled, Are we witnessing a dishonest election? They compared states who's voting systems produced verifying paper trails against states which did not. Sanders won the paper-trail states, where tampering with machine tallies could be quickly discovered; Clinton overpowered in states without paper trails, where tampering could never be detected. The authors also compared voting machine tallies with exit poll figures, and found disturbing discrepancies. They concluded, ‚Äú...these data suggest that election fraud is occurring in the 2016 Democratic Party presidential primary election. This fraud has overwhelmingly benefited Secretary Clinton at the expense of Senator Sanders.‚Äù (The paper can be found here .)
Then, with the primaries concluded a group of outraged patriots with day jobs, organized as Election Justice USA , published an exhaustive report. The study is entitled, Democracy Lost: A Report on the Fatally Flawed 2016 Democratic Primaries , and it is available here . It details, in 99 pages of carefully assembled and compelling evidence, examples of election fraud uncovered in four categories: voter suppression, registration tampering, illegal voter purging, and fraudulent voting machine tallies. In eleven states the group found discrepancies between exit polls and voting machine counts exceeding the statistical margins of error. Every single discrepancy favored Secretary Clinton‚Äîand no such discrepancies occurred in the Republican counts. The group's conclusion was troubling: 184 elected delegates, their report argues persuasively, were awarded fraudulently to Clinton and denied Sanders, accordingly.
That gave her the edge in delegate count going into the convention. In the end, however, she needed the additional votes of 163 unelected superdelegates, those empowered by the Democratic National Committee. Even after a primary season documented as fraudulent, then, Hillary Clinton's nomination was achieved by fiat, not democracy.
But the corporate elite will not be denied. Given the Clinton/DNC expertise and success in tipping the primary elections, she will be elected President in the general election, guaranteed.
The manipulation of the primaries was obscure but not invisible; a backlash of outrage might have been anticipated. The Clinton/DNC people, however, are unmatched in hubris and geniuses in the practice of deceit. Scandals were not even acknowledged, defiantly ignored. And the language of progressive democracy is omnipresent in the campaigning, brilliant deception. Hillary Clinton promises to work for Main Street, not Wall Street. She promises to bring back jobs, improve education, seek equal pay for women, boost the minimum wage, expand civil rights, provide free college education, move toward Medicare for all, oppose TPP, break up the too-big-to-fail Wall Street banks. Fine, appealing proposals all, but this is the language of Sanders' revolution, and the corporate elite will stand for none of it.
But folk wisdom tells us to take campaign promises lightly, and the American people are forgiving and trusting. Hillary Clinton is a woman of long experience, and we want to believe our democracy is robust.
Here, now, we need to be vigilant.

Ann Garrison: Clinton Serves the Interests of the Oligarchy that She Herself Has Joined,"68 Shares
67 0 0 1
Mohsen Abdelmoumen : Do you think the United States can claim to be democratic simply by electing a woman president? Can we talk about democracy in the USA with a candidate of the financial lobbies and AIPAC?
Ann Garrison: No, of course not. No more than we could claim to be a democracy because we elected a Black president. These two elections signify nothing more than the inclusion of previously excluded classes of people in the super elite. The United States is an oligarchy of the .01%, 1% of the 1%. Any president who is not already among the .01%, like Bill Clinton, becomes part of the .01% by serving its interests and then peddling influence after leaving office. No one has developed an influence peddling machine as well-oiled as the Clintons, with Bill working the Clinton Foundation and the Clinton Global Initiative while Hillary was Secretary of State. Just imagine the new depths of corruption that the next eight years and beyond could bring. Obama has said he‚Äôs now considering a move from the White House to venture capitalism that has Silicon Valley slathering at the opportunity.
Every four years Americans are given the illusion of choice between oligarchs and/or aspiring oligarchs who will serve the interests of oligarchy. Candidates who aspire to actually represent the interests of the people are marginalized by the corporate media and the pay-to-play campaign contributions of the oligarchs.
In municipal and county elections and ballot measures, Americans often do have real choices, but the higher and more powerful the office, the greater the corruption and oligarchic control. Nevertheless, only a small minority of Americans actually vote n local elections; The Atlantic's CityLab reporting project recently concluded that fewer than 20% vote in mayoral elections in 15 of the 30 most populous cites. Disengagement is one of the most fundamental facts of American political life.
Regarding federal elections, this concept of democracy within the largest, most lethal military power the world has ever seen is bogus to begin with. When U.S. citizens cast ballots to elect a new commander-in-chief who will continue the project of perpetual war, military industrial profits, and global hegemony, how democratic is that? The vast majority of those who will suffer and die don‚Äôt get to vote; the only exceptions are members of the U.S. Armed Services who die in U.S. wars. If those on the other side of the Pentagon‚Äôs crosshairs were able to vote, I‚Äôm sure they would elect our Green Party presidential candidate Jill Stein, who said, ‚ÄúWe say to Trump, we don‚Äôt need no friggin‚Äô wall! We just need to stop invading other countries.‚Äù Her running mate, vice presidential candidate Ajamu Baraka has called the humanitarian interventionist argument a new version of the white man‚Äôs burden and said, ‚ÄúYou have to ask yourself, when was the last time the U.S. has been on the side of the people? And the answer is: NEVER.‚Äù
MORE... Top Aide to Hillary Clinton Urges the FBI to Disclose what it Knows about Trump's Russia Ties What will Hillary Clinton do for India? Not Much and Here's Why Clinton's Policies Look Like a Death Sentence for Americans 10 Things to Expect with a Hillary Clinton Presidency How do you explain the dynastic governance Clinton? Is the American dream in all its glory?
I‚Äôm not sure I can explain the Clinton dynasty except to agree that it is one. Chelsea has been very involved in the Clinton Foundation and is quite likely to enter political life and even run for president one day. We have had other political dynasties, most notably the Roosevelts, the Kennedys and the Bushes, and there are many lower level dynasties, like the Browns in California. Jerry Brown, the current governor of California, is the son of former California governor Pat Brown. New York State has the Cuomos; Governor Andrew Cuomo is the son of former Governor Mario Cuomo, and his brother Chris Cuomo is a prominent corporate television host.
Regarding the American dream, I assume you're referring to the dream that if you work hard and play by the rules, you can achieve some proportionate degree of status, security and prosperity. If so, the Clintons certainly aren't living the American dream because, although they did well in school, they've hardly played by the rules. They've enriched themselves with that well-oiled influence peddling operation I mentioned earlier, the Clinton Foundation and the Clinton Global Initiative. We're all wondering whether Hillary Clinton, and maybe even Bill Clinton, might finally be indicted now that the FBI has reopened its investigation of Clinton e-mail because more of it was discovered on the laptop that Anthony Weiner - a former Congressman under FBI investigation for sex offense - shared with his wife, Clinton aide Huma Abedin. If Hillary Clinton is elected, she'll have to be impeached, convicted and removed from office, but that's extremely unlikely - no matter what's in the newly discovered e-mail - if her party, the Democrats, win a majority in the House and more than a one- third minority in the Senate. It takes a majority in the House to impeach a president and a two-thirds majority in the Senate to then convict and remove a president. So Hillary Clinton is at a Berlusconi moment in her sordid career; her best chance of avoiding indictment is getting elected. Getting back to the American dream that you can get ahead by working hard and playing by the rules, Bill Clinton was impeached by the House of Representatives, for perjury and obstruction of justice regarding his affair with a 19-year-old White House intern and his testimony in a sexual harassment lawsuit brought by another former employee. However, his own party held a majority in the Senate and they acquitted him. This was all legal, according to the U.S. Constitution, but does it really sound like he was ""playing by the rules""? During the final days of his presidency, Clinton acquitted Glencore International founder Mark Rich, an international fugitive who had fled to Switzerland. His ex-wife had donated to the Democratic National Committee, the Clinton Presidential Library and Hillary Clinton's New York Senate campaign.
According to the law, President Clinton had the authority to acquit Rich, but how would any rational person consider that anything but bribery and corruption?
In 2006, Clinton polished the reputation of President Nursultan Nazarbayev, Kazakhstan's autocratic leader and human rights offender, who then gave a uranium mining lease to Canadian businessman Frank Giustra's Shell Company, making it worth tens of millions of dollars overnight. Giustra then made a big contribution to the Clinton Foundation. No one has claimed that this was illegal, but is it ""playing by the rules""?
When Guistra sold a majority stake in his company, Uranium One, to Rosatom, the Russian atomic energy agency, it was approved by Secretary of State Hillary Clinton. Giustra then contributed $2.35 million to the Clinton Foundation and Bill Clinton was offered a $500,000 speaking engagement with a Russian investment bank with links to the Kremlin. Does that sound like playing by the rules? And now Hillary's trying to make us believe that Russia's meddling in our elections and threatening confrontation with Russia over Syria. I don't think she's kidding about the confrontation, but the Clinton Foundation rarely passes up the chance to make another million dollars or more in any circumstances.
Meanwhile, most of the rest of us are not living the American dream. Sixty-three percent of Americans are living on the edge of financial catastrophe, unable to handle a $500 car repair or a $1000 emergency room bill . The Clintons, as I said, serve the oligarchy they have also managed to join. When Bill Clinton was on his way out, in the last months of his presidency, he worked with Republicans in the lame duck Congress to deregulate the banking industry. By 2008, its dishonest, excessive and abusive financialization scams had crashed the economy, costing millions of Americans their jobs and/or homes. Then, as a New York Senator, Hillary Clinton voted to bail out the big banks who committed the crime while many of the rest of us struggled in the crash‚Äôs wake.
How do you explain that candidate Clinton, who failed as Secretary of State with the death of the US Ambassador in Libya, her health problems, the scandal of emails, is the candidate of the Democrats?
Again, Clinton serves the interests of the oligarchy that she herself has joined. Many people believe that the nomination was stolen from Bernie Sanders, the Democratic candidate who spoke out against oligarchy, growing income inequality, and even the Israeli lobby‚Äôs dominance in American politics.
But there‚Äôs one other important element to this. Americans who identify as liberals, supporters of women's rights, and/or anti-racists have such a longstanding allegiance to the Democratic Party that supporting its nominee every four years is their knee-jerk reaction. Ever escalating foreign wars don‚Äôt seem to penetrate their consciousness or conscience, especially when those wars are waged primarily with drones and proxy armies instead of U.S. troops. And once the Republicans nominated the openly racist and misogynistic Donald Trump, defeating Trump became a liberal crusade.
There are, of course, glimmers of rationality and hope. Yesterday I was out canvassing for an Oakland, California ballot measure with a young Black man, a college sophomore. Despite Trump‚Äôs overt racism, he told me that he considers Clinton even more dangerous because he understands that she has essentially promised confrontation with Russia over Syria. He understands that such escalation increases the chance of a nuclear war, accidental or not, and that Trump, for all his faults, says that the Cold War is over, that NATO is largely obsolete, and that Clinton is recklessly risking confrontation with Russia by promising to remove Bashar Al-Assad.
Our Green Party presidential candidate Jill Stein is reported to be polling at 16% among voters under 35, and much of Bernie Sanders‚Äôs support was quite visibly from the same age group. Local, grassroots organizing is also empowering people to create institutions free of oligarchic and corporate control. They include community gardens, renewable energy buyers' co-operatives, and GMO-free zones. If a ballot initiative to make California's Sonoma County GMO-free passes, the whole northwest coast of California will be a GMO-free zone, from Santa Cruz to Humboldt Counties and including one inland county, Trinity.
Don't you think that the two-headed American system with the candidates of two traditional parties, Democratic and Republican is out of breath?
I wouldn‚Äôt say it‚Äôs out of breath because it‚Äôs still very much in control. However, Trump has left the Republican Party in disarray, with many Republican luminaries and funders defecting to Clinton, who is welcoming them with open arms. As Black Agenda Report Editor Glen Ford has written , the Clintons ‚Äúhave succeeded in assembling under one party roof nearly the whole of the U.S. ruling class and their hordes of attendants and goons. The scam that undergirded the duopoly system that has served the Lords of Capital so well for so long, has come undone. Thanks to a white nationalist billionaire who was too spoiled to play by the corporate rules, the two parties of the ruling class have become one.‚Äù
It‚Äôs hard to say whether or not the Republican Party will survive this election or what it will be in another four years if it does.
One possibility could significantly change this. If Green Party presidential candidate Dr. Jill Stein wins 5% in this election, the Green Party will become an official national party eligible for 5% of the federal funds made available to official national parties to host their presidential nominating conventions and support their nominee. This year all federal funds went to the two official national parties, Republicans and Democrats, who also have access to huge amounts of plutocratic and corporate money. The Greens take no corporate money.
Five percent of the vote and five percent of the federal funding for elections may not sound like much, but it would be a huge watershed for the U.S. Greens. It would be a big psychological and visibility boost, and it would mean starting the next presidential campaign year with more than twice the funds that Jill Stein‚Äôs campaign has been able to raise.
Winning 5% would also ensure ballot access for the Greens in most states, not only in federal elections but also in down ballot races. As it is, Greens are required to spend much of their time and money just gathering enough signatures to satisfy all the byzantine ballot access requirements that vary in each of the 50 states.
Everyone knows that Clinton is the future president of the USA. In your opinion, why they are facilitated her task and who has interest in seeing Clinton in the Oval Office?
She is backed by the oligarchy, corporate and dynastic, particularly the investment bankers, the oil industry, and the weapons manufacturers who not only profit but also lobby for foreign wars. They are advancing their own interests by promoting a candidate who will serve them. Liberals have been conditioned to function as unpaid Clinton operatives in this election, and the corporate media, like the cops, serve as protectors of the oligarchy. And again, the majority of Americans are politically disengaged.
You are close to Jill Stein, head of the Green party, which emerged late in the campaign. Why was this alternative sabotaged?
Well, I wouldn‚Äôt say I‚Äôm close to Jill personally, but she knows who I am and I, of course, know who she is. I‚Äôve reported on her campaign and on the U.S. Greens for the past year, on radio and in print and online outlets, and I‚Äôm always honored when she shares those reports on her social media pages. I write for the Black Agenda Report and feel politically and intellectually close to its editors, who have given their full support to the Green Party this year, even as Bernie Sanders surged in the polls and many imagined he might actually win the Democratic nomination. In these times that are so easy to see as the end times, shared rationality and humanity are the closest bonds that many of us have, regardless of the geographic distance between us.
Jill‚Äôs campaign could hardly compete with the Republicans' and Democrats' because neither she nor any other Greens solicit or accept corporate money. We stand behind the slogan, ‚ÄúPeople and Planet before Profits.‚Äù And we call for a halt to the death march led by the weapons manufacturers, fossil fuel giants, and agro-chemical companies who profit from it. Jill calls for immediately cutting the military budget by half, closing all the U.S. military bases in foreign countries and launching a ‚Äúpeace offensive.‚Äù She proposes free public education from kindergarten through college, the abolition of student debt, national health insurance and a ‚ÄúGreen New Deal‚Äù that would reinvest the resources now squandered on weapons manufacture and all the illegal, immoral, lethal and environmentally catastrophic U.S. wars. The Green New Deal would create a renewable energy infrastructure and sustainable agriculture before it‚Äôs too late to stop the climate meltdown - if it isn‚Äôt too late already. And it would fully employ Americans in meaningful, dignified and cooperative work for the common good.
Of course that all makes far too much sense and threatens the highly concentrated wealth and power of the death-march industries. I would not be surprised if there were voter fraud to prevent Jill Stein and Ajamu Baraka from winning the 5% that would make us an official national party.
I have also seen enormous oligarchic determination to stop Greens at the local level. In 2003, Matt Gonzalez, the Green Party's mayoral candidate in San Francisco, seemed to have a good chance of winning. That so alarmed the Democratic Party that it sent all its best known, most powerful names and faces to San Francisco to campaign for the Democratic candidate. They sent Hillary and Bill. They sent Jesse Jackson. They sent many Democratic Party superstars more than once. They seemed to be more concerned about defeating Matt Gonzalez and the Greens in San Francisco than they were about defeating George Bush and the Republicans in the following year‚Äôs presidential election.
One of the founders of the San Francisco Green Party was elected to the City and County Board of Supervisors twice, but when he ran for Sheriff, an executive office, Democrats pulled him aside and said they could not allow his election unless he left the Greens and joined the Democratic Party, which he did. They still got rid of him after his first term, with a really ugly campaign, but that‚Äôs another complicated story in itself. The City and County of San Francisco once had more elected Greens than any city or county in the country, but many of those that Greens worked so hard to elect have since defected to the Democratic Party for the sake of their political careers.
Is not Hillary Clinton a danger for humanity?
Hell yes. I agree with Congolese author and political activist Patrick Mbeko, who said she‚Äôs more dangerous than ISIS, for all the reasons I‚Äôve already mentioned. Her dark alliance with the death-march industries, and her seeming eagerness to confront Russia over Syria and/or on Russia‚Äôs borders in the interest of global hegemony. Russian uranium deal aside, I think that Diana Johnstone was most likely right when she wrote that ‚Äúher strategic ambition in a nutshell is regime change in Russia.‚Äù
And I have to mention my friends from the African Great Lakes Region - particularly Uganda, Rwanda, Burundi and the Democratic Republic of the Congo - which became the killing grounds of the 1990s, as the U.S., using African proxies, established itself as the dominant power there. Most of my friends from that part of the world are horrified by the Clintons‚Äô all but certain return to the White House. The Clintons are deeply committed to the false history of the Rwandan war and massacres that was used to justify the First and Second Congo Wars and later the ‚Äúhumanitarian‚Äù interventions in Libya, Syria, and Iraq. If the truth about Rwanda and DR Congo were known, Bill Clinton would be implicated in mass murder, but that's true of every U.S. president in office in my lifetime and probably long before that. No one's going to try to refer the most lethal military power in history to an international criminal court with more than symbolic authority.
You have many worked on Africa. How do you explain the French leadership in Africa?
Well, I‚Äôm no expert in this, but I can say a few things.
First, I wouldn‚Äôt call it leadership. I‚Äôd say that France sustains a neocolonial and military presence in Africa. France was a partner in the destruction of Libya. In Mali, Niger, the Central African Republic, and the Democratic Republic of Congo, France is protecting the uranium mines essential to the nuclear power that generates 75% of its electricity. There‚Äôs no doubt that France was complicit in the assassination of resource nationalist and debt resister President Thomas Sankara and the installation of President Blaise Compaor√© in Burkina Faso. I don‚Äôt see any sign that French policy towards Burkina or any of its other former colonies is any more benign now, despite its resignation to Compaor√©‚Äôs ouster by a popular movement.
France and the U.S. now appear to be military partners in Africa more often than not, but during the Rwandan war and massacres and the Congo Wars of the 1990s, the U.S. displaced France as the dominant power there.
However, a source of ongoing tension between France and the U.S. has been their divergent accounts of the massacres known as the Rwandan Genocide. The U.S. defends Rwandan President Paul Kagame‚Äôs account, in which he is the savior who swept in to stop the carnage. Kagame blames France, particularly for Operation Turquoise, in which French troops created a humanitarian corridor for Rwandan refugees, mostly Hutus, who were fleeing the advance of Kagame‚Äôs Rwandan Patriotic Army. This conflict has recently been renewed, first with France reopening its investigation of allegations that Kagame ordered the assassination of Rwanda and Burundi‚Äôs Hutu presidents, Juvenal Habyarimana and Cyprien Ntaryamira, in 1994. Rwanda responded by accusing 22 French officers of helping to plan and organize genocide in Rwanda.
In 2010, Nicholas Sarkozy attempted to ease the tension between France and the U.S. and Rwanda by accepting the U.S./Rwandan account of the massacres. He publicly apologized for France‚Äôs alleged guilt in Rwanda‚Äôs tragedy , and shortly thereafter, France was rewarded with greater access to DR Congo's resource riches. However, Alain Jupp√©, who was the French prime minister at the time of the Rwandan massacres and Operation Turquoise, was having none of that. He even left the country during Kagame‚Äôs 2011 ""reconciliaton"" visit to Paris . Now Jupp√© seems to be leading Sarkozy in the bid for his party‚Äôs nomination, and if he is elected president, the history of Rwanda and DR Congo in the 1990s will be more fiercely contested. Most of my Rwandan friends very much hope that Jupp√© will be elected because he defends the dissident history of what really happened. They believe, for one, that Operation Turquoise saved many Rwandan lives.
While Africa is a young continent, How do you explain that the countries are often directed by old presidents with several mandates and who don't want lose the power?
The old presidents cling to power, and the Western powers with geo-strategic interests enable them because autocrats are easier to corrupt and control than rowdy democrats and resource nationalists who try to represent their own people. Rwanda‚Äôs Kagame and Uganda‚Äôs Museveni are two prime examples of autocrats who have proven very useful to the U.S. and other Western interests.
France, the U.S., and all the rest of the NATO nations appear to be united in their determination to topple Burundi‚Äôs Nkurunziza, who has dared to raise an independent head and to favor the East, particularly Russia, in resource extraction contracts. I can't explain Mugabe's hold on power at age 92 or Omar al-Bashir's at 72, since neither are U.S. aliies. You'll have to ask Africans in those countries to explain that.
In your opinion, is not tribalism a major factor in the destabilization of Africa? Why doesn't Africa progress and does it stay in the tribal model?
I really hesitate to say anything about that because I‚Äôm not African myself and I think Western media often use the word ‚Äú‚Äòtribe‚Äù as a racial slur that disguises Western resource interests at play in African conflicts. I recently wrote a piece about the new film A Brilliant Genocide , and Milton Allimadi, the Ugandan-born editor of the Black Star News, told me he loved the piece but asked me to remove the one instance in which I‚Äôd used the word ‚Äútribe.‚Äù I told him I'd been hesitant about using that word and was glad to remove it. I‚Äôm now reading his book, ‚Äú Hearts of Darkness: How White Writers Created the Racist Image of Africa .‚Äù
Why are Congolese being massacred in Beni Territory, North Kivu Province ? The first question I've asked to try to answer that question is, ‚ÄúWhat resources are there?‚Äù In Beni, the answer is oil, timber, gold, diamonds, wolfram, coltan and cassiterite. Beni is a vivid example of the saying, ‚ÄúEverybody wants a piece of Congo.‚Äù No one could convince me that the industrial nations‚Äô hunger for all these riches is not at the heart of these conflicts. Why are all the deadly ‚Äúethnic‚Äù conflicts in DR Congo‚Äôs resource-rich eastern provinces?
The competition and/or animosity between ethnicities or groups is often real, as they are in the West, but in Africa, the geostrategic and resource interests of the industrial nations are always in play behind the scenes. Western powers often exacerbate local rivalries in pursuit of their own interests.
I sometimes co-host a show called AfrobeatRadio with my friend Wuyi Jacobs on WBAI-New York City, and we both hope to someday produce a show about Rwanda and Burundi in which we won‚Äôt have to use the words ‚ÄúHutu‚Äù or ‚ÄúTutsi.‚Äù Dr. L√©opold Munyakazi convinced me that these two groups are better understood not as tribes or ethnicities but as social classes in Rwandan history that were exaggerated by Europeans who have found it convenient to pit one group against the other.
Libya lives total chaos. How do you analyze the situation in Libya?
It‚Äôs horrible. Like so much else, it makes me deeply ashamed to be an American. If you read Hillary Clinton‚Äôs e-mail, it‚Äôs easy to see that the U.S.]/NATO war on Libya was, for one, another Western war against another defiant resource nationalist, Muammar Gaddafi. Regardless of whatever human rights offenses Gaddafi or Saddam Hussein were guilty of, both were resource nationalists, as was Mohammed Mossadegh, the secular, democratically elected prime minister of Iran who nationalized Iranian oil before our CIA and the UK's M16 ousted him in the 1953 coup. I wrote about how this played out in Libya in ‚Äú Clinton E-MaIl: We came, we saw, we got oil .‚Äù
Obama says that failing to prepare for the aftermath of the Libyan War was the greatest mistake of his presidency, but I'd say his greatest mistake was waging the Libyan War in the first place. Like the Iraq War, it has created chaos and perpetual war that continues to spread through the Middle East and North Africa.

‚ÄòLike Asking if You‚Äôll Stop Beating Your Wife‚Äô: Saudi Ambassador to US Dodges Yemen Cluster Bomb Question - American Herald Tribune,"22 Shares
3 18 0 1
Prince Abdullah Al-Saud, Saudi Arabia‚Äôs ambassador to the United States, was confronted by a reporter from the Intercept .
‚ÄúWill you continue to use cluster weapons in Yemen?‚Äù the reporter asked the diplomat.
Al-Saud laughed before answering: ‚ÄúThis is like the question, ‚ÄòWill you stop beating your wife?‚Äô‚Äù
After the reporter repeated the question, the ambassador again dismissed it, saying ‚ÄúYou are political operators. I‚Äôm not a politician.‚Äù
Speaking at the Annual Arab-US Policymakers Conference last week, al-Saud insisted that the Saudi-led coalition will continue its bombing campaign in Yemen, the Intercept reported.
‚ÄúIf anyone attacks human lives and disturbs the border, in whatever region, we‚Äôre going to continue hitting them, no matter what,‚Äù said al-Saud.
Human Rights Watch (HRW) has accused the Saudi-led coalition of war crimes following an airstrike on a funeral in Yemen on October 8. In that incident, at least two air-dropped munitions penetrated the roof of a hall containing over 1,000 mourners during the funeral ceremony of Ali al-Rawishan, the father of the Sanaa-based administration‚Äôs interior minister, Jalal al-Rawishan. At least 140 people were killed and 610 wounded.
Despite calls by US officials to review its support for its Middle Eastern ally, Washington continues to sell arms to Saudi Arabia, approving more than $20 billion in military sales in 2015 alone, HRW reports.
According to UN data from August this year, the Saudi intervention in Yemen has claimed the lives of at least 10,000 people, including almost 4,000 civilians. The UN and HRW have repeatedly accused the Saudi military of dropping cluster bombs in Yemeni residential areas.

CETA Is Step towards a Corporate Land Called Euramerica,"3 Shares
2 0 0 1
The signing of the Comprehensive Economic Trade Agreement with Canada (CETA) on the 30th of October marks the beginning of North America's annexation of Europe. The negotiations for the treaty were carried out behind closed doors. For over 751 deputies in the European Parliament, there are more than 30 thousands lobbyists. The Society for European Affairs Professionals (SEAP) - the organisation which lobbying on behalf of multinational corporations ‚Äì this is the real power block in Europe. The European worker has absolutely no say and henceforth he will lose the right to form join unions. Multinational corporations will have unlimited power over European workers, who will see the destruction of what is left of social gains won from over a century of class struggle.
Will European workers lie down and accept this imposture? What concrete policies would weaken the stranglehold of corporations over European workers? Which parties in the current political landscape hold policies which, if implemented, would weaken the transatlantic stranglehold?
There are currently no political parties running in the major European elections with candidates who genuinely represent workers' interests. But there are some political movements which threaten the corporate 'power-elite'. We will mention them below.
There are two important geopolitical processes to consider here. The first is the East-West corporate , geopolitical axis. America is pulling the European peninsula away from the Eurasian continent. With the installation of a neo-Nazi regime in Kiev, Washington attempted to re-create an 'Intermarium' from the Baltic Sea to the Black Sea and down to the Eastern Mediterranean - driving a permanent wedge between Russia and Germany.
In order to facilitate the social transformation of Europe into a 'America Minor', millions of 'pilgrims' are necessary. Hence, the deployment of coercive engineered migration as a tool to replace class- conscious European workers with deracine youths - in some instances educated enough to do the low-paid work assigned to them and acculturated enough to pose no problem to the 'Power-Elite'.
In the new Trotskyite language of this imperial order, any leader who attempts to stem the tide of globalisation through populist appeals to tradition and national identity is 'fascist'. Fascist is a loaded term which generally connotes evil in the public mind. In each European country there is a ready-made army of youths from wealthy families whose job is to don hoddies, attack police and scream 'fascist' and 'racist' at working-class people desperately trying to find a way out of this nightmare. These 'antifa' are the modern equivalent to Oswald Mosley's fascist gangs in the 1930s; they represent the same class interests .Petty-bourgeois leftism is the New World Order's avant-garde.
A favourite passtime of the 'Antifa' mob is throwing stones at police officers. One can only gain acceptance in the anti-fascist gang by showing how much one hates the 'pigs'. So, police officers from honest working-class families get burned alive while the anti-fa mob chants slogans from the Spanish Civil War. Such violence is now a regular occurrence in demonstrations. The agents provocateurs often receive help from the intelligence services. French police are finding it hard to cope with the chaos developing all over French suburbs. They complain that they are not sufficiently equipped and do not have the powers necessary to deal with the growing violence from delinquents. They have been demonstrating in Paris. They have been calling for an end to the control of the French police by free masonry. Exacerbating the problem is the deep-seated racism of many police officers who target Black youths with spot-checksm ‚Äì very often without reason.
The recent demonstrations by French police in France against poor working conditions and low pay strongly suggests that there is the possibility that the rank and file of the French police could be waking up to the reality that France is government by a criminal gang. After the Magnanville terrorist attack in June where two police officers were killed, a police officer at the funeral of the deceased refused to shake the hand of President Hollande and Prime Minister Manuel Valls. It was a highly significant act of insubordination.
The police, who in capitalist societies are the guardians of the ruling class, are beginning to realise the criminality of the people they are protecting; they are perhaps beginning to understand that the role of the state is to impose the dictatorship of one class over another - that of the minority of super wealthy over the labouring masses.
Many of these dissident police officers are linked to Le Pen's National Front. A reliable source in French intelligence informed me that the secret services spend more time watching the far-right than the so-called 'far left'. They see the far right as a real potential danger to the ruling order, whereas the far left present no danger but are in fact a key component of ruling class ideology. From the 'Arab Spring' to Nuit Debout, the far-left are the life-blood of capitalism. The potential of a major split between the national and compradore bourgeoise of imperial states for prospects of working-class gains is something that needs more study.
What should we make of all this in the context of CETA? As I have said on numerous occasions, the far right in France are and always have been political opportunists who exploit the despair of the masses; they serve the interests of the national bourgeoisie. But the National Front are regularly denounced by the media, not for being right wing. Rather, they are dismissed as being closer to the far left. The prospect of raising worker's salaries, nationalisation of key industries and a halt on the importation of cheap labour appeal to working-class families.
As I have pointed out before, looking at a debate between the Trotskyist Jean-Luc Melanchon and Marine Le Pen in 2011, one would have thought that Le Pen was was the leftist and Melanchon the right-wing militarist. Melanchon shamelessly defended the NATO bombing campaign of Libya, while Le Pen opposed it!
Civil war on the horizon
The right-wing presidential candidate Philippe de Villiers has said there are plans afoot to divide the French territory between Muslims and non-Muslims. He Quote: s Francois Hollande's own writings to back up his claims. Everyone is talking about an imminent civil war. In the bars and cafes of Paris one can hear more and more disgruntled French citizens talking about media disinformation, the demonisation of Russia, the homogenisation of thought and the criminality of the ruling class.
The scene has never been more propitious to a populist take over of French politics. But one should not have illusions about the National Front; they are following the menacious Zionist narrative on the war on terror: Muslims are the problem. The party's vice-president Forian Philippot is close to the ultra-Zionist lawyer Gilles-William Goldnagel, a friend of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.
Philippot recently condemned the comments of presidential candidate Jean- Fr√©d√©ric Poisson who said Hillary Clinton presented the greatest threat for the world as she is in the pay of the Zionists. Poisson was subsequently forced to kneel before the Representative Council of Jewish Institutions in France (CRIF) where he sought forgiveness. He was told he would be forgiven but they they would never forget! In spite of the National Front's anti-Muslim bias, an increasing number of Muslims are voting for the party. Many Muslims prefer the National Front as they are sick and tired of being patronised and manipulated by the left ‚Äì with their pseudo 'anti-racism' and 'humanitarian' wars.
There have also been major strikes by police in Ireland for similar reasons to France. French workers are losing everything and will soon become a lumpen proletariat. Meanwhile the French government has programmes in place to encourage migrants heading to Britain to stay in France. The Socialist Party is creating a new electorate. It is a wise move for them because after the next election abstentionism will be the norm and the indigenous lumpen proletariat will resent the migrants. The oligarchs will keep the masses in bondage through GMOS, Takfiri anti-Islam and total reification of life. CETA is the beginning of the end for social hope. It is the prelude to the Trans-Atlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (TTIP) ‚Äì the most evil trade deal in history.
French vice-president of the Trilateral Commission Herve de Carmoy wrote a book in 2007 entitled 'L'Euramerique' ‚Äì Euramerica, where he argues for the formation of what amounts to a transatlantic super-state run by a financial oligarchy. CETA is the prelude to that project.",1
Palestine Considers Suing Israel in International Sports Court,"2 Shares
2 0 0 0
The Palestine Football Association (PFA), in a first testing of Palestine's ability to fight its battle with Israel in international courts, plans to go to the world's top court for sports in a bid to force its Israeli counterpart to view Israeli settlements on the West Bank as occupied territory rather than an extension of the Jewish state.
The potential Palestinian move follows the Palestinian Authority's campaign to isolate Israel in international organizations and challenge Israel's occupation of the West Bank in the International Criminal Court (ICC).
Using soccer as a testing ground, Palestine's efforts to confront Israel in international organizations has produced mixed results. While Palestine succeeded in joining various international organizations, the PFA last year failed to muster sufficient votes to persuade world soccer body FIFA to suspend Israel. The PFA argued that the policies of the Israeli government and the Israel Football Association (IFA) violated FIFA rules as well as international law governing the status of occupied territory.
The PFA has since been unable to push FIFA towards any punitive steps against Israel. Instead, FIFA opted to monitor developments and attempt with little success to negotiate a way out of the impasse. Palestine is expected to take legal recourse if FIFA fails to take more decisive action at its next council meeting in January.
The PFA's focus since failing to get Israel suspended has been on banning six clubs that are based in Israeli settlements on the West Bank from playing in Israeli lower divisions. FIFA rules stipulate that clubs based in a recognized federation's territory cannot play in leagues of another soccer association without the permission of the home federation. The PFA rejects the notion of granting permission because it believes that it would legitimize Israeli settlements and the occupation.
MORE... Swedish soccer player sent off for loud fart during match PFA President Jibril Rajoub suggested that the PFA would take its case to the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS) after a seven-hour meeting earlier this month of a FIFA committee headed by Tokyo Sexwale failed to resolve the issue.
Mr. Sexwale is scheduled to visit Israel later this month for a meeting with Israeli sports minister Miri Regev. The FIFA Council is scheduled to discuss the issue at its next meeting in January. The PFA is likely to prepare its case for CAS, but wait with filing it until after the January meeting.
Israel sees the Palestinian demands and threat as strengthening the growing boycott, divestment and sanctions movement (BDS) that sees penalization as a means of forcing the Jewish state to alter its policies and ultimately withdraw from territory occupied during the 1967 Middle East war.
Condemnation of the Israeli occupation and settlements by the United Nations Security Council constitutes the legal basis for the PFA's approach as well as potential challenges in international courts.
The strength of the Palestinian position has been weakened changing [Persian] Gulf attitudes towards Israel and Saudi and United Arab Emirates pressure on Palestine Authority president Mahmoud Abbas. [Persian] Gulf states, despite paying lip service to the Palestinian cause, have become more public about their informal relations with Israel based on common opposition to expanding Iranian influence in the region.
Writing in the kingdom's controlled press, a prominent Saudi journalist went as far as calling for the establishment of diplomatic relations with Israel. The UAE last year agreed to the opening of an Israeli diplomatic mission accredited to the Abu Dhabi-based International Renewable Energy Agency rather than the UAE government. Bahrain, as part of an agreement to host next year's FIFA congress, has consented to issue visas to representatives of the IFA. Israeli nationals are barred from travelling to [Persian] Gulf countries.
At the same time, Saudi Arabia and the UAE have been pressuring Mr. Abbas to resolve his differences with Mohammed Dahlan, the controversial former Abu Dhabi-based Gaza strongman who is an archenemy of the Palestinian president. Mr. Dahlan is widely seen as a successor to 81-year old Mr. Abbas, who would be acceptable to Israel.
Israel may be able to count on some degree of tacit [Persian] Gulf support within FIFA but is likely nonetheless to ultimately have to be seen to be accepting some kind of compromise that throws a bone to the Palestinians.
The Palestinians' focus on the Israeli West Bank teams has however raised the bar for Israel. An agreement between Prime Minister Benyamin Netanyahu and former FIFA president Sepp Blatter struck last year addresses many of the PFA's grievances but not the issue of six the West Bank teams. Their status goes to the heart of the Palestinian-Israeli conflict: the legal status of territory occupied by Israel since 1967.
Under the agreement, Mr. Netanyahu proposed to give Palestinian players special identity cards and place sports liaison officials at crossings between Palestinian areas and those under Israeli control in a bid to eliminate obstacles to free movement that complicated the development of Palestinian soccer. Mr. Netanyahu further suggested to create an escort service that would facilitate players' travel between the West Bank and Gaza that are separated by Israeli territory.
Israel initially appeared to live up to its promises by granting for the first time in 15 years, a West Bank team, Hebron's Al Ahli, passage to Gaza to play a Palestine Cup final against the strip's Al Shejaia. Hopes that this signalled a new beginning were however dashed when the PFA cancelled the return match in Hebron after Israel agreed to grant passage to only 33 of the 37 players who were scheduled to travel. Implementation of the agreement has since evaporated.
The PFA, by putting the West Bank teams at the top of their agenda, has made it tougher for FIFA and Israel to work out a compromise that would not have implications for the future of Israeli-Palestinian peace making. Israeli is likely to want to avoid subjecting its policies to the scrutiny of an international court. Yet, that may be exactly what would best serve the Palestine Authority's overall strategy.",1

He stressed that both the ISIS and al-Qaeda terrorist groups are the product of Saudi Arabia, and that ISIS's psychological and media campaign is partially funded from Riyadh.
Mohandes noted that the operations to free Mosul from the Takfiri terrorists will take some time as the militants are receiving intelligence from several external sources, mainly the US.
He went on to praise Iran‚Äôs support for Iraq‚Äôs battle against terrorism, stressing that if Baghdad had not called for Tehran‚Äôs assistance, the Iraqi army would never have reached Mosul.
He also noted that the Hashd al-Shaabi forces, also known as the Popular Mobilization Units, will move on towards Tal Afar after Mosul is cleared of ISIS militants.

Meanwhile, as Iraqi forces push on with operations to liberate Mosul, five high-ranking ISIS commanders have looted the terrorist group‚Äôs treasury and fled towards Syria.
The robbers, including ISIS‚Äôs treasury official Abu al-Bara al-Qahtani and several other terrorists, have taken millions of dollars.
The terrorists have launched a manhunt to reclaim the stolen money and arrest and execute the escapees.
Iraqi troops fighting house to house in east Mosul
Heavy fighting is underway in eastern Mosul as ISIS tries to hinder Iraqi forces advance in the city. The militants are using car bombs, mortar fire, and snipers to stop the government troops.
A separate group of troops are advancing on the city‚Äôs northern side and have reached just within four kilometers of Mosul‚Äôs airport.
Iraqi forces have also attacked ISIS-held positions in the town of Hamam al-Alil which is located along the Tigris River some 15 kilometers south of Mosul.
Iraqi army troops, backed by Hashd al-Shaabi and Kurdish Peshmerga forces, are closing in on Mosul, ISIS‚Äôs last stronghold in Iraq, from almost all directions in a full-scale operation launched on October 17.
Iraqi troops managed to enter Mosul‚Äôs limits earlier in the week for the first time since June 2014, when the city fell to ISIS amid a large-scale terror campaign in northern and western Iraq. So far, a large number of the villages and districts around the city have been purged of the terrorists. Iraqi Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi has vowed that the country‚Äôs second largest city will be fully recaptured by year-end.",1

Fahmi Abbas, an officer in Iraqi Armored Units had an interview with IRNA and said: ‚ÄúISIS terrorists have equipped 600 dogs with bombs and want to send them among Iraqi Army forces and explode them by remote control.‚Äù
As stated by this military official, ISIS‚Äôs intention is to hinder advance of Iraqi Army to the city center of Mosul.
This new plan was brought up when most of terrorists‚Äô suicide attacks were neutralized by Iraqi heat-seeking missiles before reaching their aim.
According to the statistics announced by Iraqi Army, during the 19 days since Mosul liberation operation began, terrorists of ISIS have performed 100 suicide attacks in different regions, although they didn‚Äôt succeed in delaying the advance of Iraqi forces.
Fahmi Abbas stressed that all Corps have been informed about terrorists‚Äô new tactics and they won‚Äôt be taken off-guard.
This Iraqi military official also mentioned the possibility of using other animals for suicide attacks by the terrorists. He said that ISIS is under siege and terrorists have nowhere to escape, unless they surrender or get killed.
On Saturday (5th Nov), Iraqi Army entered ‚ÄúHammam al-Alili‚Äù in south of Mosul and managed to free this part of city in the western bank of Dijlah (Tigris river).

Political Prisoner Takes on US Military-Industrial Complex,"The ultimate underdog 23 Shares

Ever since the telling of biblical fairy tales, few stories have lived up to the hype around the mismatch between the shepherd boy David and the giant Goliath. In the biblical encounter, David prevailed by keeping his foe Goliath at a distance with a formidable weapon, his sling.
Today a modern-day version of David and Goliath is playing out.
Although granted political asylum by Ecuador, a target of US empire finds himself ensconced under a form of arbitrary detention in Ecuador's London embassy under constant surveillance by British police. The fully weaponized US empire, which boasts of its full-spectrum dominance, has arrayed itself and its allies against one unarmed (as in having no conventional weaponry) man who heads a publishing organization.
This uppity publisher has had the temerity to expose the secret machinations and war crimes of the military-economic (albeit faltering on both fronts) behemoth to the world's public. The pro-transparency publisher Wikileaks, its founder (and de facto political prisoner) Julian Assange, and anti-secrecy collaborators infuriated the United States establishment with a slew of documents, emails, and graphic exposes like the "" Collateral Murder "" video that demonstrated a US military engaged in war crimes.
Nations states are adamant and fastidious about keeping their internal workings under wraps. But it is a one-way street, as many nation states seek to gather and store any and all information about the citizenry without seeking court approval or the approval of the citizenry in question.
MORE... Swedish government implicated in charges against Assange UN body to rule on ""arbitrary detention"" of Wikileaks founder Web-savvy Wikileaks objects to this double standard, and it welcomes, vets, and publishes troves of secret information premised on the principle of the public's right to be informed about what their government is up to.
Evidence makes it clear that the violent American establishment engages in browbeating, inciting so-called color revolutions to destabilize and overthrow disobedient governments, military encirclement, and saber rattling. This self-described indispensable nation which preens its might before major nation states such as China and Russia was not about to have its full-spectrum dominance challenged by punk computer hackers.
Leaning on its allies, the US enacted a financing squeeze on Wikileaks. Many nation states have been severely crippled and devastated by US sanctions, but tiny Wikileaks proved more resilient and cleverer than the Washington schemers.
In an attempt to topple Wikileaks, the US establishment has sought to lop off the head of Wikileaks. It has kept close tabs on Julian Assange and is purportedly behind a scheme to bring Assange down in Sweden: ""We have been warned that the Pentagon, for example, is thinking of deploying dirty tricks to ruin us.""
In Sweden consensual sex has been parlayed as rape. In self-defense Assange spoke to the facts of the situation :
Here we have a case, the Swedish case, where I have never been charged with a crime, where I have already been cleared [by the Stockholm prosecutor] and found to be innocent, where the woman herself said that the police made it up, where the United Nations formally said the whole thing is illegal, where the State of Ecuador also investigated and found that I should be given asylum. Those are the facts, but what is the rhetoric?
... the UN formally found that the whole thing is illegal, never even mentioning that Ecuador made a formal assessment through its formal processes and found that yes, I am subject to persecution by the United States.
Disinformation and distraction are among the underhanded tactics of empire.
While in Britain, Assange was eventually placed under house arrest. Sweden played out the drama while refusing to press charges or interview Assange in Britain on the allegations. It insisted he come to Sweden, which Assange was unwilling to do without an assurance that he would not be deported elsewhere, knowing full well that the US Department of Justice was preparing a case against him. Sweden refused to give such an assurance, which speaks strongly about Sweden's intent to seek justice for any alleged crimes committed against its citizens.
Despite all this intrigue, Wikileaks has continued to publish and Assange has continued to give interviews. Assange did not cower, instead he chose to fight back against Hillary Clinton and the Democrats. This is because Hillary Clinton and the Democrats are the principals in power and the grand jury investigation into himself and Wikileaks has been occurring during their time in government.
Clinton and the Democrats are victims of their own zeal and hubris. Along the way many outs presented themselves to the Democrats. They could have dropped the grand jury investigation. They could have provided an assurance that there would be no request for Assange's deportation from Sweden. The US could even have given a presidential pardon to Assange. Extremely telling about the caliber of man that Assange is, is that he offered himself as a prisoner in exchange for the release of another political prisoner, Chelsea Manning.
But empire and its minions were dismissive as is the way of empire. Empire does not negotiate deals. It takes what it wants because it believes it can.
The result
The corruption in the Democratic party has come to light. Wikileaks revealed that the Democratic National Committee conspired against party aspirant Bernie Sanders and heads fell. Clinton tellingly hired the subsequently fallen DNC chair Debbie Wasserman Schultz.
Clinton's emails were leaked as were those of her campaign chair John Podesta. Revelations include ""pay-for-play, as they call it, giving access in exchange for money to states, individuals and corporations,"" a "" direct connection between Hillary Clinton and the foundation of jihadism, of ISIL, in the Middle East,"" ""Libya, more than anyone else's war, was Hillary Clinton's war,"" and banks buying cabinet positions.
The Clinton campaign has, predictably, been thrown into disarray.
The Clintonites could not refute what was in their own emails. Instead they sought to deflect attention elsewhere. The Clintonites blamed Russian hacking for interfering in the US presidential race. Finally, Julian Assange felt compelled to state :
The Clinton camp has been able to project that kind of neo-McCarthy hysteria: that Russia is responsible for everything. Hilary Clinton stated multiple times, falsely, that seventeen U.S. intelligence agencies had assessed that Russia was the source of our publications. That is false; we can say that the Russian government is not the source.
Neither is Wikileaks complicit with Russia:
We have published about 800,000 documents of various kinds that relate to Russia. Most of those are critical; and a great many books have come out of our publications about Russia, most of which are critical. Our [Russia]documents have gone on to be used in quite a number of court cases: refugee cases of people fleeing some kind of claimed political persecution in Russia, which they use our documents to back up.
Graciously toward Clinton, Assange said he feels sorry for the woman who wanted to "" drone "" him. Imagine what the response would have been if Assange had discussed the possibility of a drone attack against Clinton.
Presently, Assange downplays the damage from the barrage of leaks to the Clinton campaign for the presidency.
Trump would not be permitted to win. Why do I say that? Because he's had every establishment off side; Trump doesn't have one establishment, maybe with the exception of the Evangelicals, if you can call them an establishment, but banks, intelligence [agencies], arms companies... big foreign money ... are all united behind Hillary Clinton, and the media as well, media owners and even journalists themselves.
However, a counter coup was announced against the coup by ""Clinton cronyism."" It is said to include FBI, CIA, military intelligence, other security organizations ""through Julian Assange"" that have promised to stop Clinton from becoming president and to convict and indict her and her cronies.
A revolution?
No matter what transpires on November 8, the reverberations from this confrontation should be monumental. US democracy has ‚Äî again ‚Äî been revealed to be glaringly corrupt. Most importantly, the world's preeminent military-industrial complex has been shown to be susceptible to the power of one person. Properly framed, it is the power of one person to work with other persons to form a greater consciousness, a consciousness that ultimately will transcend and defeat the corruption of empire.",1
"Massachusetts is the Next Laboratory for School Privatization, and Why it Must Be Stopped","9 Shares
5 3 0 1
An important question is on the 2016 election state-wide ballot in Massachusetts. Question 2 deals with the state‚Äôs charter school cap. Without the cap, upwards of 12 charter schools could be approved by the state district in the next fiscal year. The charter school scam has spread its tentacles into the state ofMassachusetts in large part due to the Obama Administration. A vote ""no"" is thus critical toward halting the march of privatization in the education system occurring nation-wide. As Massachusetts residents gear up to vote for the next President of the United States, it is important to remember that the transformation of public education into a private good will not cease as long as popular opposition fails to confront its roots in Washington.
The Obama Administration immediately created the Race to the Top program after the 2008 election. This program paved a direct path toward the elimination of public education as we know it. The Department of Education funneled billions of US dollars into incentive schemes to privatize public schools district by district. Federal funds were dangled in front of mostly poor, mostly Black cities as long as these districts met the ""mandates"" of the program. These mandates included the closure of ""failing schools,"" mergers with for-profit charter schools, and the complete transformation of public schools into charter laboratories. Race to the Top created favorable conditions for private capitalists to engulf the entire US public education system.
The results have been disastrous. Hundreds of public schools have closed around the country. Tens of thousands of public school teachers have been fired. In New Orleans, nearly every school operating in the district is a privately owned by "" publicly funded"" charter schools .The Chicago teachers union recently averted a strike but has been dealing with the consequences of the closure of fifty schools in the city in 2013 .
The impact of charter schools has extended beyond teacher layoffs and school closures. Charter schools have also promoted segregation based on race and class. The Civil Rights Project of UCLA has found that seventy percent of black charter school students attend intensely segregated charter schools . Furthermore, charter schools also demand an even more intense policy of standardized testing withcurriculums that are often guided by the test corporations themselves. All the while, these institutions have found ample time to discriminate against ELS and disabled students.
In addition, charter schools have been found to cheat students from a quality education. Charter schools are even more militarized than traditional public schools and sport higher rates of suspension and expulsion rates. Corporate charter operators also ""cream"" students from the top and toss the rest. Even so, charters have not proven to do any better than public schools in terms of test scores . What the charter school movement does possess is the backing of the elite, which has masterfully used media and non-profit manipulation to demonize public education.
The usual capitalist players have been the primary leaders in the drive to rid of the charter school cap in Massachusetts. The New York Lobbying group ""Families for Excellent Schools"" is controlled by Hedge Fund managers whose funds stem from donations from the Walton Family (i.e. Wal-Mart). Another organization, ""Education Reform Now Advocacy,"" has received upwards of 11 million dollars from the same source . Charter schools are often labeled ""public"" because they receive tax payer dollars. However, the schools are accountable to no one except the corporate interests that back them.
A ""Yes"" vote on Question two would place the education of students in Massachusetts firmly in the hands of the kingpins of privatization. Not only would twelve charter schools per year be subject to approval, but forty-five public schools would be in danger of closure. Over 100 million more dollars per year would be siphoned from public schools across the state. At the moment, the charter school cap allows the state to operate no more than 72 charter schools. If the cap islifted, however, this restriction would no longer apply and leave the students, families, and educatorsvictimto the ""shock and awe"" privatization which has characterized national policy for over two decades.
Opposition to privatization is being led by the organization Save Our Schools. Save Our Schools consists of families, teachers, students, and unions that are looking to prevent an era of unbridled privatization in the Massachusetts public education system. Charter schools already drain 450 million from public education in the stateeach year as it currently stands. A vote ""no"" would protect public schools and thus the unions that representtheir educators.
A ""no"" vote would build upon numerous labor victories in the Massachusetts area over the last few years. The Boston School Bus Drivers union Local 8751 won a historic victory against the Veolia Corporation in 2015. The Harvard Dining Workers of Local 26 UNITE HERE followed by defeating Harvard's bid to raise healthcare costs in October of 2016. Now it is time to stand with teachers across the state in their effort to prevent full-scale privatization.
Doing so will not be easy. The model of union-management cooperationwith theDemocratic Party continues to prevent workers in Massachusetts and across the country from taking offensive action against the privatization assault. A vote ""no"" on question 2 in Massachusetts would show that community and union members can organize a successful push-back against the forces behind privatization. However, a vision of transformation and radical change must be articulated if defense of public education is to materialize into a people's movement. The fight against privatization must be placed in the contextof the larger struggle to build a world that working and oppressed people would vote ""yes"" to.",1

Creating an Anti-Muslim Bias at a Canadian University,"Professor Dr. Mujahid Kamran, Vice-Chancellor of the University of Punjab, on the Suspension without Pay of Prof. Tony Hall 1 Shares

Professor Mike Mahon President and Vice Chancellor Lethbridge, Canada
Dear Professor Mike Mahon,
It is with a sense of great sadness that I have learnt of the suspension, without pay, of Professor Anthony Hall, one of the most distinguished scholars, not only of the , but a researcher and writer who is recognised and respected globally. In a country like Pakistan, which is far behind Canada in term of education, research and scholarship, no teacher, or non-teacher, of any university can be suspended without pay. When someone is suspended, he or she is entitled to draw full pay for the period of suspension. If Canada is doing better than us on various scales, then one would expect that suspension without pay puts Canada behind us in terms of due process and in terms of requirements demanded by the principles of justice and fair play. I may add respectfully that in Pakistani universities no one is generally suspended unless a fact finding committee has first looked into the matter thoroughly and found prima facie evidence of wrong doing. The decision of the administration also destroys the concept of a tenured appointment.
 From his writings, that I have read over a period of time, it is evident that Professor Anthony Hall is a scholar whose work exposes the crimes and conspiracies of those who are taking the world headlong into a global war and simultaneously transforming it into a global slave state. His analysis is impeccable and his grasp of facts masterly. And his writings are devoid of any prejudice against any ethnic group or nation. , or any university for that matter, should have been proud to have Professor Hall on its faculty. His suspension creates an impression, even from this distance from where I write, that certain powerful interests that aim destroying free speech, have targeted people like Professor Anthony Hall, who speak out for democracy, decency, peace and justice.
I have found out from the internet that B‚Äônai Brithis behind this movement against shutting down free speech. It is quite evident that the charge that Professor Anthony Hall has created a discriminatory atmosphere is highly dubious. To the contrary, it appears that an anti-Muslim bias has been created in your institution by Professor Hall‚Äôs unfortunate suspension.There is also a strong impression that B‚Äônai Brith has taken over the administrative decision making at Lethbridge.
MORE... Suspension of Tenured Professor Lacks Due Diligence Toxic Mind Control Contaminates The Public Sphere Irish human rights activists against freedom of speech? B‚Äônai Brith attack on Canadian professor has roots in Zionist false flag tactics It is also worrying that B‚Äônai Brith have now targeted Canadian universities and Canadian society. If this is the case then the situation is disturbing, not just for Lethbridge and Canada, but for all freedom loving people worldwide. When I was a young student at University of Edinburgh, Scotland in the 1970s, I used to meet many Canadian students and I found that they invariably stood for freedom of speech and for tolerance and justice. The suspension of Professor Hall is inconsistent with my image of the Canadian people that I had then formed.
On behalf of the academic community of the University of the Punjab (established 1882) I urge you to kindly reconsider your decision to suspend Professor Hall. It will go a long way in rehabilitating the impression of people worldwide about the upholding of free speech, academic freedom, and genuine scholarly discourse at Lethbridge.

""USA! USA! USA!"" they chanted together in the Hilton Ballroom as the results came in. Who needs polls? They never gave him a chance but now we have it: President Donald Trump. Not only were the polls spectacularly wrong (who will ever trust this particularly bankrupt form of moralising presumptive analysis and telling us how we do and should feel?) but also the pundits who were not just arrogant about the fact that Trump had no chance but also were hopelessly out of touch with what America was thinking across its societal spectrum, what it wanted, what was felt deep in its blood.
It is a rejection of the liberal consensus the entire West has wallowed in since the 90's and a rejection of Obama and the false hope he decried, the impotent nature of US political leverage around the world and the rejection of brazen corruption and questionable ethics as typified by ""Crooked Hillary"".
The world must live with it; democracy has spoken and they're going to have to get over the words President Trump. Some will head for the hills, some will run to Canada, others will continue to cry but as Obama said yesterday, regardless of the result ""tomorrow the sun will still shine.""
This is a cry for American exceptionalism and like him or not Trump typifies that. He is committed to education, and demands high performance. Selling well is an admirable skill for a President to have. Negotiating with Congress, internationally, etc., is exceptionally useful. Trump has taken beatings financially and come out smelling like a rose.
Trump's business experience involves negotiations with business leaders and even governments around the world, and he likely has connections behind the scenes that surpass those of simply purely political candidates -- this gives him keen, realistic insights into economics in different parts of the world, as well as additional avenues to pursue trade agreements, and even perhaps some nuanced insights of particular financial weaknesses of possible global competitors, not to mention experience and insight into the partnerships and/or antagonism between different industries and particular governments.

What Donald Trump is doing is representing the absolute heartbreak and anger and frustration at a government gone mad and it seems the Left completely underestimated that in their vitriol in crying #NeverTrump and portraying him as the devil incarnate.
Although it is entirely true that Trump is ostentatious and has his mistakes, he brings something to the Presidential table no other candidate had before; he speaks his mind.
America clearly is sick of weasel politicians who are too afraid to say what people want to hear, they want the facts straight.
President Trump isn't cut from the political class, that class which is entrenched in its self-interest and has let the country down time and time again. Ross Perot once said that we need somebody to clean out the stables, a corrupted, ethically questionable President is therefore not the answer in order to accomplish that and I'm not talking about Donald Trump.
Trump is a pragmatist in an era of rapidly approaching chaos, he is not a social engineer, a think tanker who wants to please those lining his bank accounts. The liberal Democratic policies of Obama, U.S. Rep. Nancy Pelosi, U.S. Sen. Harry Reid and their company created a climate that has led to this decision today.
So what if his language is intemperate and insulting? Even lacking in nobility from time to time? How can a true changemaker be straitjacketed by politically correct chains if he or she must express the will of the people, uncomfortable concerns that lie dormant for far too long?
Obama won because conservative voters stayed home. He had promise and he let so many down, what did Clinton have? And that is why conservative voters had to get out and vote.
Trump prefers isolationism on a world scale, Clinton voted to take us to war in Iraq and to overthrow Libya's Gaddafi, all in the guise of being ""muscular.""
Perhaps today's landmark and historic decision is not so much about Trump's strengths and power but more about the crippled weakness of the country in 2016 and you simply cannot blame him for that.",1

About 5.5 million Muslims from all over the world travel to Mecca, Saudi Arabia in ""Hajj days"" and perform Hajj. But "" Pure Mohammadi Islam"" and ""Alavi education"" is not advertised and explained properly in Hajj because of the restrictive policy of Saudi regime.
Imam Reza, peace be upon him, stated: If the beauty of Islam is heard by others, they all will follow wholeheartedly the prophet's household inevitably.
""Arbaeen"", golden opportunity
Attending million of Shias in Arbaeen create a massive and international unity among Shias .
Karbala can be a ""symbol"" of unity and allegiance to Imam, that has the ""world's effects"". The start of Husseini Magnetic Attraction is in ""Arbaeen"". This is the magnetic that exists in my and your heart over the centuries.
So if we can't publish the Shia massage efficiently in Hajj, we can universalize it in Shia glorious presence in the Husseini massive rally.
In fact the Hajj pilgrimage for Imam Hussein followers is in Karbala, their try between Safa and Marvah in the "" Beyn Al-Haramain"", and their ""Ihram clothes"" is the ""mourning clothes for Aba Abd-Allah"".
Walking to shrines is topical
Imam Hassan Askari, peace be upon him, mentioned that one of the real believer's sign is walking to visit Imam Hussein in Arbaeen.
Imam Sadigh, peace be upon him, told to one of his followers: Visit Imam Hussein's shrine, and don't give it up. I asked: What is the reward for visiting him? Imam ‚Äìpbuh- stated: When you walk to visit Imam Hussein, Allah gives you a reward and removes your guilt, and raises your grade.
At the other time, Imam Sadigh said: If someone goes out of his home and walks to visit Imam Hussein's shrine, Allah gives him a reward and removes him guilt for each step to visit Aba Abd-Allah, when he reaches to shrine, Allah considers him among righteous favorites. When his rites finish, Allah registers him among success, when he is coming back an angel of God stays on him and tells: The messenger of Allah says Hello and gives tidings to you that all your faults are forgiven, start again your actions.
Walking tradition has an old history.
In a way, walking tradition for Imam Hussein in Arbaien has an old history. Walking to visit Karbala was customary at Sheikh
Ansary's time. But it was forgotten for a long time. It revives again by ""Sheikh Mirza Hussein Noori"". He walked to visit Aba Abd-Allah in 1319 (Hegira) for the last time.
Although visiting Imam Hussein s shrine was often difficult, and pilgrims were not safe and secure, but they were willing to take risks and had an audience to Imam Hussein in Arbaeen.
Islamic life style
At that time with full of great interest and knowledge, in the way ""Hussein path"" that leads to Karbala, Shias called each other just with ""Hussein visitors"" (zayer Al-Hussein), or ""Hussein server"" (khadem Ol-Hussein), that is a symbol of Islamic life style.
Pilgrims of this holy and spiritual journey have a lot of blessing and gifts from God, such as: the nice spiritual state with ""holy Sayyed Al-Shohada"" - generous dealing with pilgrims entertaining and receiving by Hussein servers- sacrificing and respecting for each other- treating elders and sayyeds kindly and considerately- visiting the Imam Hussein's holy shrine in Arbaeen.
Role and place of Imam Hussein's visitors
Visiting Aba Abd-Allah is a good evidence of esteeming and honoring the divine rituals, and display love and friendship with prophet's household, according to the Quranic verse of ""Mavaddat"".
Imam Hussein's holy shrine visitors enter into heaven before all, their guilt is disappeared, their life will be long, and God provides for them and removes their sadness and sorrow.
Of course if this old tradition that is established again after destruction of Iraqi dictator, not to be cultural pathology, it will certainly have the negative effects.
Because every phenomenon is threatened, it seems if this pilgrimage tradition becomes a primer to the cultural work, it will be more effective and blessings than today.",1
The B'nai Brith and the History of the Mounting Assault on Academic Freedom in Canadian Universities,"Prof. Rafiq Islam Responds to the Vice-Chancellor of the University of Punjab Outlining the Background of the Hall Case at the 2 Shares

Dear Vice Chancellor Kamran:
Salam from the East coast of Canada.
Thank you for taking the time to address this important issue regarding Professor Hall. Like yourself, we all have been stunned by the voracity of Dr. Mahon‚Äôs action. We used to think academics of certain reputation were above the reach of the tentacles of the Establishment. We all hoped that a president would not resort to such a shameless pandering to a special interest group. However, B‚Äônai Brith is not just a special interest group, it is perhaps the most vindictive organization that has ever received prominence in the west. Allow me to elaborate.
You have correctly identified B‚Äônai Brith to be ‚Äúbehind this movement against shutting down free speech.‚Äù While this statement is accurate, this phenomenon of targeting Canadian universities and Canadian society is not something that started now. Not too long ago, it used to be branded as ‚Äòthe hidden hand behind the hidden hand‚Äô. During the Harper era, this operation became a full-blown politically driven policy directive. The legislation that Dr. Mahon pathetically relies upon is a product of the Harper era. Harper had an extremist right-wing background and organizations like B‚Äônai Brith have channelled that extremism to accomplish their hateful agenda. As early as the 1980s, I personally observed the spirit of this unholy union during my tenure as the president of Muslim Student Association at the University of Alberta. Although Harper didn‚Äôt attend that university, we were not too far from the epicentre of the neo-conservatism movement that was brewing in Canada. We fast-forward 30 years and come upon the type of events such as Professor Hall travesty that are products of that time. In fact, a web of such operations has been in full force for sometime in every aspect of Canadian lives. Only recently, we had this court ruling against Canadian Security Intelligence Service that was illegally spying on the public. This gangster-like involvement started in 2006, shortly after Harper and the neocon came to power.
This is not to say that the public is protected from such unconscionable manoeuvring under a liberal government. In fact, the most notorious scandals involving government and human rights have erupted during the liberal regime. Take for instance the case of Omar Khadr travesty .
MORE... Creating an Anti-Muslim Bias at a Canadian University Suspension of Tenured Professor Lacks Due Diligence Toxic Mind Control Contaminates The Public Sphere Irish human rights activists against freedom of speech? This case is something we had known, albeit too late to intervene at the time, and has been subsequently discredited publicly, even during the Harper regime . The overwhelming theme was pointed out by then barely 16 year old, Omar Khadr, who said, ‚Äú You don‚Äôt care about me ‚Äù. This is what defines the mindset of these people, bent on extremism over extremism to subdue public conscience.
The attack on Professor Hall was particularly toxic, but equally sinister attacks have taken place before. Some decade ago, now defunct Canadian Islamic Congress faced onslaught from all sides based on planted stories and baited manoeuvring. It was the largest Muslim Organization at a time Canadian Muslims became the largest religious minority. One particular episode involved B‚Äônai Brith‚Äôs planted story involving a University professor, who became the target of hate crime, while at the same time investigated for hate crime. If it wasn‚Äôt for the humane and civic behaviour of the then University president (current Governor General), David Johnston, it would have become career threatening, if not life threatening event of the professor. Top university personnel told me in private how the university faced pressure from ‚Äòdonors‚Äô that wanted that professor to disappear from the academic as well as public arena. The vendetta of this sort beggars belief even today. What we don‚Äôt know is how many of these assaults on conscience took place and has been brewing.
Clearly, some of the faithful members/sympathizers apply it publicly. Such was the case of former professor turned politician, Irwin Cotler, who routinely infected the political arena with his prejudice and bias imported from the academia. Then there are others, such as Alan Rock of University of Ottawa that implanted manoeuvring of the political arena to the academia. A third group would be Lorna Marsden of York University that abused authority to run a vindictive agenda. Yet, others have found every other way possible to target a person of conscience all the meanwhile covering up all trails so the victim cannot point a finger to the attacker and has no recourse to justice or self defence. It doesn‚Äôt matter which category they belong to, they all produce scandals and drag down the good name of the academia while agencies that are supposed to be uphold the rights and dignity of the academia stand by and, for some cases, join in to the atrocity. This obscene attack on human rights and academic decency was once brought to light by late Professor David Noble, who ended up suing York University and Canadian Jewish Congress jointly for conspiring against him. Professor Noble, a Jew himself, faced the vilest of subjugation by organizations claiming to promote the rights of Jews. That wasn‚Äôt enough, Dr. Noble had to take on Human Rights Commission and other agencies that stood by either in complicity or in collusion with the University authority. Professor Noble passed away before the lawsuit could see a day in court but soon University of Ottawa would come in the picture with the infamous involvement of Alan Rock, a man without a PhD that was at the helm of the University. Mr. Rock recently left the University‚Äîbut not before leaving the University‚Äôs good name in the sewerage of politicking. What Dr. Mahon has done is bring this insidious modus operandi to yet another victim.
Had I not have the misfortune of being on the wrong side of this modus operandi in the last 30 years, I would almost not understand what is at works here. In old days, such tactic would be unheard-of in a University. Certainly, such things couldn‚Äôt happen in a civilized country, I would exclaim.
So, what happened to Professor Hall is not new. What is new is the waking up of the general public. Your letter reverberates the emotion of everyone with conscience that came to know about Professor Hall. People are waking up and are beginning to ask for justice. For instance, in the context of CSIS, an activist, Jim Comeau wrote, ‚ÄúI would say it's time to jail the highest ranking CSIS to send a clear message to the rest of them, do something illegal, straight to prison. They damn well knew what they were doing was illegal.‚Äù
The People‚Äôs revulsion to such atrocious maligning of people of conscience was summed up in recent letter of Julian Assange, who wrote on US General election day (November 8, 2016):
‚ÄúYet, some weeks ago, in a tactic reminiscent of Senator McCarthy and the red scare, Wikileaks, Green Party candidate Stein, Glenn Greenwald and Clinton‚Äôs main opponent were painted with a broad, red brush. The Clinton campaign, when they were not spreading obvious untruths, pointed to unnamed sources or to speculative and vague statements from the intelligence community to suggest a nefarious allegiance with Russia. The campaign was unable to invoke evidence about our publications‚Äîbecause none exists.
In the end, those who have attempted to malign our groundbreaking work over the past four months seek to inhibit public understanding perhaps because it is embarrassing to them ‚Äì a reason for censorship the First Amendment cannot tolerate. Only unsuccessfully do they try to claim that our publications are inaccurate.‚Äù
Of course, recent events have allowed us to see this in the highest level of politics in the United States.
To anyone with an iota of conscience, there is no mystery here. People are making their voice clearly known. In the words of Claire Lanyado, ‚ÄúI prefer unpredictable to criminal and evil.‚Äù The problem is, when a president of University for whatever reason decides to use his position to serve the special interest group deliberately, there is no recourse for a professor to fight him/her. In other cases, if such atrocity were launched against a student (e.g. the case of Freeman-Maloy vs. Lorna Marsden of York University ), the student, an anti-Zionist Jew, could bring a lawsuit of misfeasance in public office with the help of yet another Jewish lawyer, Peter Rosenthal (who himself is a University professor of Mathematics). It was struck down by the court, and then it was overruled by the court of appeals. At the end, the University settled and Dr. Marsden, the embattled President was gone. The morale of this story is, the path to justice is steep, but for a professor, the path to justice is becoming impossible.
The irony is that it is the people harboring so much hate who tell others that they are committing hate crimes, just because they dare speak out against an atrocity. Of course, they pick their targets that are perceived as weak and vulnerable and they attack the target only after making sure that the target cannot run to anyone for justice.
That‚Äôs how extremism works.
 Sincerely,
Rafiq Islam",1
,"This looks like a fake letter. Especially this part; ""His analysis is impeccable and his grasp of facts masterly. And his writings are devoid of any prejudice against any ethnic group or nation.""
Hall's ""analysis"" is laughable, his basic understanding of the ideas he talks about is vapid, and he clearly voices prejudice against an ethnic group, in fact he relies on prejudices against an ethnic group when he uses the 'dual - loyalty Jews' argument as 'evidence' that Israel was involved in 9/11.",1

For the last 30 years, I have witnessed and experienced the severe restraints on any free and balanced discussion of the facts. This reluctance to criticize any policies of the Israeli government is because of the extraordinary lobbying efforts of the American-Israel Political Action Committee and the absence of any significant contrary voices.
‚Äî Former U.S. President Jimmy Carter [1]
How the Interviews Came About
The Marxian thesis that the dominant culture and ideology of a society (here referred to as Social Base or just Base) are those of the dominant class (here referred to as System) is a sharp tool to probe how political systems work and how they stay in power. Does this tool work in the U.S. model? Certainly, , the relation between the System and its Social Base has been regular since the inception of the thirteen colonies. Because of that sustained regularity, System and Base acted in convergent patterns of dependency. In historical perspective, it was not possible for the System to transform those colonies into states, and thereafter expand its conquests to form a continental empire without a solid social base that shared its purpose and visions for expansion. From that time onward, an ideological symbiosis ran between the System and the Base. Not only that, but each time the System modifies direction, philosophy, or ideology, the Base would adapt by modifying its attitudes and perception.
The patterns of ideological association between the U.S. System and its Social Base extended into modern times, and the yardstick to measure them is the presidential elections. If you look at voters' turnout since 1960 , you will notice that a relative-to-large majority of Americans had voted in those elections. My interpretation of the vote in relation to Marx's thesis is the following. Voting for a system that is known for its aggressive imperialist policies, crimes around the world, overthrowing foreign governments not in line with Washington, and countless military interventions and invasions that left millions of people dead means one thing: Voting for that system while knowing its attributes, policies, and actions amounts to active sharing in its ideology, culture, and violence.
MORE... Zionism is Racism Zionism goes from bad to worse, taking Judaism with it How modern is Israel? Green Party of Canada calls to revoke Jewish National Fund charitable status Caveat! That does not necessarily mean that all voters share the System's imperialistic values of violence and destruction of foreign peoples. The pertinent meaning of voting interpreted in relation to the System's foreign policy objectives versus the objectives of the Base resides in two concepts. Discarding immediately the notion that the Base has been cohabitated by the system, the first concept has it that the Base has given a mandate to the System to carry out its ideology of empire and imperialism based on the undeclared condition to spare the people from the horrors of foreign wars. A dichotomy sets in here. The System has its way of life, and the Base has its own. The second concept has to do with the basic tenets of colonialism. Meaning, if the System could be successful to obtain unspecified benefits through wars, then the base could share in these benefits despite aversion to violence and opposition to the institution of war as a means to resolve problems between nations.
 A question: Would abstaining from voting resolve the issue of ""active sharing"" in the policies of the system? This subject is open for debate . . .
The relation between the American System and its Base was uniform up to a certain point in history (late 1920s). Until that point, the American state was still busy completing its structural transformation into a big power status. That uniformity, however, managed to keep the patterns of the political power unchanged. To be exact, despite persistent immigration that should have altered the relations between the Base and government, as well as the composition of the latter, the dominance of the traditional ruling elites was 1) not open for challenge, and 2) shaped by an exclusive American Anglo-Saxon experience.
But when Franklyn D. Roosevelt showed signs of surrender to the Zionist pressure on the issue of establishing a ""Jewish"" state in Palestine, he opened a large crack in the System. That was the first time in U.S. history where the powerful American imperialist state yielded to a foreign ideology that was not part of its basic project. With that, a movement with a limited religious social base began penetrating the files and ranks of the U.S. power. The rest is history. As a result, the unrelenting entrenchment inside the political structures of the United States coupled with accumulated changes in the configuration of the U.S. power, the dominant American System itself fell under the domination of one of its social factions‚ÄîAmerican Jewish Zionists.
When Franklyn D. Roosevelt showed signs of surrender to the Zionist pressure on the issue of establishing a ""Jewish"" state in Palestine, he opened a large crack in the System.
As a group, American Jewish Zionists have all attributes of an independent establishment. They possess efficient organizational structures, have a monolithic political presence across the American system, and they know how to finance their activities with U.S. tax money. I must note that their alignment with the global agenda of U.S. imperialism is a two-point expedient. The first is focused on being recognized as earnest operators at the service of America's interests. The second is tactical. To reap, on behalf of Israel, the benefits of alignment with slogans such as ""Israel is our only trusted ally in the Middle East"".
The American Jewish Zionist experience is agenda driven. As such, their domestic and foreign agendas have precedence over any other Jewish-related consideration.
On the domestic front, the focus could not be more evident: to consolidate Zionism and turn it into a means to 1) perpetuate Israel as an American national issue, and 2) make of them the principal factor in defining American politics. You can notice the endeavor clearly during U.S. elections when the Zionist media question whether this or that candidate is good for the Jews, and for Israel. Today, voicing dissent against the policies of American Jewish Zionism or criticizing Israel amounts to crime. Jimmy Carter experienced this firsthand. When he published his book: Palestine: Peace not Apartheid , American Jewish Zionists unleashed the fire of hell upon him.
As for the Jewish Zionist foreign agenda, this is clear-cut and leaves no space for misunderstanding. It aims to induce, control, or lead the United States to 1) adopt hostile policies toward the Arab nations because due to their rejection of the Zionist state, and 2) undertake military actions against any country that appears as posing a potential or direct threat to Israel. Equally important, it demands that the United States keep denying the Palestinians rights for nationhood through American diplomacy. What is the rationale? Recognition of the Palestinian national rights means the invalidation of the Zionist state and its claim on Palestine.
Because the Jewish Zionist control of the U.S. System is real and dominant, how does the American society figure vis-√†-vis this dominance? Based on observations of the American society and its multiple cultural and ideological patterns, there can be but one answer: Zionism is not the dominant culture and ideology of the American people. It is, however, the dominant culture and ideology of the U.S. political system.
OBSERVATIONS
First, despite gargantuan Zionist propaganda apparatuses directed to the American people, Jewish Zionists have consistently failed to create interest or sympathy for Zionist issues and for Israel,
Second, due to historically developed indifference to foreign issues, a majority of Americans have only vague ideas on what Zionism is,
Third, to establish roots for their political dominance, Jewish Zionist activists invariably focus not on the American people, but on ways to control the American system from inside by controlling first the institutions that matter: White House and Congress.
Fourth, this control did not happen because of elections. It is preponderantly due to the practice of appointing Jewish Zionists to important positions inside the administrations,
Fifth, among the stratagems employed by Zionists when they run for elective offices, one was particularly effective: Take advantage of the reverence of the population for the idea of election. To do that, Jewish Zionist candidates rarely, if ever, talk about Israel or Zionism. Instead, they only debate matters of interest to the voters. Once elected though, promoting Israel via American legislations becomes the top hidden agenda,
Sixth, and to conclude this particular argument, the fact that one administration after another succumbed to the diktat of Jewish Zionists (thus indirectly to Israel) in matters of foreign policy and wars proves that the culture and praxis of those administrations are those of the dominant ideology and culture‚ÄîZionism.
Another point to discuss is the expansion of the Jewish Zionist power. By all accounts, such an expansion is not a phenomenon but an incremental process. In his book, The Arabists: The Romance of an American Elite , Robert D. Kaplan defined the issue that I framed as a process in terms of gradual replacement of traditional diplomatic elites with new ideological elites that had no interest in the ways of the old school of diplomacy. Kaplan was unambiguous. He called these new elites by their names: Irish-Americans and Jewish-Americans.
Kaplan's viewpoint on this replacement is important to our discussion. He argued that the old elites approached the U.S.-Arab relations with an open mind and readiness for dialog, all while keeping an eye on the U.S. imperialist interests. His argument opens the door for a veritable conclusion. The two groups of post-WWII American society that Kaplan mentioned had in fact changed the dynamics of U.S. foreign policy. (It is public knowledge that both groups are known for their hostility toward Arabs and Muslims‚Äîeach for his own set of religious, political, and ideological rationales.). As for the successive shares of African-Americans and Hispanics in the making of the national policy of the United States, this is another argument.
As a witness to history, in early 2012, I began drafting a comprehensive analysis on the role of American Jewish Zionists in the making of U.S. policies and wars in the Arab world. In May of that year, as my work became broad in scope, I decided to seek more views on the subject. I came up with the idea to conduct several interviews where I pose the same questions. While some of the prospective interviewees declined, and others accepted but then withdrew, three prominent thinkers acclaimed for their knowledge, scholarship, and outstanding political activism graciously gave me their views.
They are Francis Boyle, a professor of international law, University of Illinois, College of Law; James Petras, a professor emeritus, University of Binghamton, New York; Canadian writer and former co-editor of the online publication of Dissident Voice Kim Petersen. Professors Boyle and Petras answered my questions via phone conversations, and, Petersen via email correspondence.
However, in the weeks following the interviews, my work swelled up to such a length that it became unsuitable for internet publishing. In short, I was unable to honor my commitment to publish the interviews as planned. Today, as I thank Prof. Francis Boyle, Prof. James Petras, and Kim Petersen for sharing their invaluable insight, I apologize to them for the delay in putting the interviews out there to read.
INTRODUCTION
The turning point in the emergence of Jewish Zionism as a dominant American political force came about when Iraq invaded Kuwait. (Discussing the origins and strategic complications of that invasion goes beyond the scope of this introduction.) The Jewish Zionist establishment seized the occasion, mobilized its omnipresent propaganda operatives, and led colossal media campaigns to promote military actions against Iraq. To bring their war mania to fruition, they unleashed their ""experts"" in all directions. They talked about Iraq's ""formidable"" military capabilities and about Saddam's one-million-man standing army ready to invade Saudi Arabia and seize its oil. They told stories about Saddam Hussein's personal life, his bunkers, and his mortal ""nuclear threats"" to Israel. And they talked about Iraq's threats to U.S. interests and ""allies"" in the Middle East. . . . Here is a brief account of those events.
On July 25, 1990, Iraqi president Saddam Hussein met with U.S. ambassador to Iraq, April Glaspie. It is on record that Glaspie gave Hussein an unambiguous but indirect greenlight to resolve Iraq's problems with Kuwait militarily. On August 2, Iraq invaded Kuwait. On August 3, George H. W. Bush ordered the freezing of Iraqi and Kuwaiti assets and immediately placed Iraq under hermetic embargo. Considering the prompt, extraordinary anti-Iraq measures that the United States took in the first 24 hours of that invasion, one wonders what was pushing the U.S. to move so quickly on Iraq knowing that only two days earlier, this was conducting a U.S. proxy against Iran. The observation that the U.S. did not take similar actions when Iraq invaded Iran in 1980, or when Israel invaded Lebanon in 1982 raises many questions. What were the U.S. rationales in taking such measures? Who conceived them? Did the U.S. entrap Iraq? Why? . . .
The atmosphere that followed the invasion was surrealistic. Like a lightning bolt, U.S. imperialist and Zionist forces instantly mobilized their media, talking heads, retired generals, and bogus experts on the Middle East. The deafening uproar they made and all lies they told about atrocities committed by Iraq in Kuwait hid a definite scheme: Incite for war . In the period August 2, 1990 ‚Äì January 14, 1991, Israelis and Jewish Zionists from all fields appeared en mass and in every possible medium available to urge the Bush regime to give up diplomacy in favor of war. On January 15, 1991, a 30-member ""coalition"" in which the U.S. had the lion share‚Äîninety-seven percent of the total force‚Äîattacked Iraq. By every standard and minutia of details, the war on Iraq in 1991 was an American War .
At the end of a war that destroyed one of Israel's Arab adversaries, George H. W. Bush might have thought of himself as America's ""laureate hero"". He did not predict though that his temporary freezing of the U.S. loan guaranties to Israel, would have unleashed the Jewish Zionist establishment against him. The fact that he lost to Bill Clinton (who opposed Bush's freeze, and who stated that Israel was the ""only country that paid back its debts"") indicated that American Jewish Zionists had finally reached their objective: To perfect ways to control the U.S. politics from the inside . In retrospect, it can be said that George H. W. Bush was the last non-Zionist American president. From Bill Clinton forward, U.S. presidents and their vice president became pawns in the Jewish Zionist play of power.
Now, as the United States was preparing for war with Iraq to ""liberate"" Kuwait, thousands of antiwar activists and intellectuals from a wide spectrum of political convictions spoke loudly against it. But no one could have ever beaten Patrick J. Buchanan's memorable words about how American Jewish Zionists and Israel were pushing for that war. He said, ''There are only two groups that are beating the drums for war in the Middle East - the Israeli Defense Ministry and its amen corner .'' [2] With that, Buchanan hit the proverbial nail on the head. A.M. Rosenthal, a ringleader of U.S. Zionist journalism could not bear what he heard. In a rebuttal, he unleashed an acerbic attack against Buchanan. His weapon of argument, so to speak, was the stale and trite accusation of ""antisemitism"".
Whining, Rosenthal twisted Buchanan's clear words and went on to imply that Buchanan was in effect engaging in an ""anti-Jewish"" tirade. He re-interpreted Buchanan's words and cast them in a standard Zionistic fashion. He wrote that Buchanan's intention was ''The Jews are trying to drag us into war. Only Jews want war. Israeli Jews want war to save Israel's hide. American Jews who talk of military action against Iraq want war because it would suit Israeli interests. They are willing to spill American blood for Israeli interests."" [3]
By inserting the word, ""Jew"" in his reply, Rosenthal and the New York Times behind him spat on the face of U.S. political reality under the tight grip of Zionism. We need not waste our breath on Rosenthal's petty tactic. His clear objective was to distract from the central issue, which is, Buchanan's opposition to the planned war against Iraq was unrelated to the religious denomination of those who were promoting it. Rather he was unmistakably referring to their political identity.
Still, Buchanan was honest. He pointed the finger to Israel and its ""Amen corner"" because that was the truth. The fact that most Israelis and ""Amen corners"" happened to be of Jewish faith was nonissue. To conclude, it is evident that Buchanan, a dreamer of an American ""republic"" not ""empire"", could not stand by idle while seeing the United States sheepishly fastened to the yoke of Zionism and gutlessly prostrating before a tiny settler state, Israel.
Buchanan did not stop there. Truthful and resolute, he dared to describe in categorical terms the pitiful condition of the U.S. Congress vis-√†-vis Israel and American Jewish Zionists. He dubbed it as ""An Israeli-occupied territory"" [4]. Buchanan powerfully hit the target in such a way that countless cowardly American politicians would dare not think, let alone say. Notice that Buchanan had placed Israel before its U.S. ""amen corner"". I view this as a statement. He clearly implied that Israel is the primary decision maker. Did that also imply that U.S. Zionist groups (amen corner) are puppets moved by Israel? Most likely, if so, which has more power in setting the U.S. world agenda and policies: Israel or American Jewish Zionists? Dialectically, the answer should be Israel by means of its ""amen corner'.
Now, in December 1991, Jim Lehrer (a former co-anchor of The Macneil/Lehrer NewsHour, and later sole anchor of The NewsHour with Jim Lehrer ) interviewed Pat Buchanan. It is important to mention, that Jim Lehrer has monopolized a significant position funded by federal tax money for over 30 years starting in 1975. Is that an issue? Yes, and to debate it, the following applies. Whenever a specific group of people, be they Christian, Muslim, Jewish, atheist, duopoly party apparatchiks, etc., keeps an important public post for such a long duration, the implication is unescapable: the group controls that post because of its embedded importance. . . . But more important, they have the power to keep it.
Nonetheless, when a specific group continues to hold, throughout time, important positions inside public corporations, agencies, and branches of the U.S. government, a paradigm emerges. Either the group controls said corporations directly‚Äîthat is why it is able to do what they want. Or, it controls them indirectly by controlling first who appoints the board of trustees and sets corporate policies and appointees. At any rate, considering this type of control, the assumption that such group has power over the government and its public corporations is reasonable.
Additionally, the issue of monopoly of news is critical in another respect. It means that someone within the context of U.S. imperialism has decided that the U.S. public discourse must conform to predetermined patterns. In these patterns, issues such as Israel, Zionism, Palestine, U.S. imperialism in the Middle East, wars, etc., are designed to move only on linear grounds without ever touching the core of the matter.
Before continuing, I must state that Lehrer's political views are not a subject to discuss vis-√†-vis his program. For one, the NewsHour program is not about the personal views of presenters‚Äîit is about information prepared for the public from a public corporation. Second, whether Lehrer had sympathies for Israel or Zionism is nonissue because most viewers expect neutral discussions regardless of who delivers them. Nevertheless, a situation such as this has a consequence affecting the special relations between the narrated news/comments, the people who deliver them, and the people who hear them.
Firstly, planning news delivery to attain specific results is a good technique for those in the business of indoctrination. Psychology and perception are the areas of expertise that news planners depend on to disseminate certain news and analyses. To be sure, these planners know that most viewers have no special or personal stakes on events happening in other countries. Still, the immediate consequence that controlled news and commentaries could generate is easy to predict. They also know they can seep to the viewers pre-conceived ideas through pleasant dialogs, affable manners, appearance of neutrality, and clever circumlocutions.
To be fair to Lehrer, he was consistent in making intelligent questions. However, he was also consistent at doing something else. He would calibrate his questions in such a way as not to reveal new truths or solicit critical replies that could go beyond boundaries deliberately conceived so as not to be crossed. It is pragmatic to say that the observance of these boundaries would nicely serve the Zionist and imperialist discourse. In essence, a practice thusly followed is a preemptive mechanism of control cloaked as a professional presentation.
Now, in his interview, Lehrer played dumb when he asked Buchanan about his bold characterization of the Congress. He phrased his question as follows, ""You have also said that Congress is an Israeli-occupied territory. Now, what do you mean by that ?"" [Italics are mine]
COMMENT: Semantically as much as politically, Buchanan's figure of speech was terse and unequivocal. He plainly meant that the Congress observes Israel's agenda and acts accordingly. There was no need for Buchanan to say anything further because what he said had (and still has) basis in verifiable facts. With a question such as, ""what do you mean by that"" Lehrer was not seeking a rational reply from Buchanan. The form and content of the question had the objective of wanting to entrap Buchanan, make him retract, or at least contradict himself to show inconsistency. In essence, Lehrer had simply tried to deny that Israel controls the Congress through its ""amen corner"" because his ""what do you mean"" indicated astonishment rather than request for explanation. [5]
To wrap up the issue, without exclusion, any denial of the Jewish Zionist control of the United States is a farce. Take Abraham H. Foxman of the infamous Anti-Defamation League as an example. Foxman authored a master‚Äëdeceptive propaganda book that he called, "" The Deadliest Lies : The Israeli Lobby and the Myth of Jewish Control. [Italics are mine]. First, Foxman lied. He knew very well that the Jewish [Zionist] control is not a myth but a pervasive reality. Second, but most important, the problem is not the abstract ""Jewish control"" but the specific‚ÄîJewish Zionist control. This can be explained using a current universal truth: hundreds of thousands of Jews from all nationalities actively oppose Zionism on political, religious, ethical, historical, and ideological grounds.
Foxman's denial means one of two things. Either he is a parochial charlatan when the subject is the undisputed power of American Jewish Zionism, or he is very ignorant of the history of Zionism , which is impossible. Either way, Foxman's business is propaganda, demagogy, and deception. Incidentally, Foxman's denial looks very similar to what some Arabs do in the Middle East. Villagers‚Äîbut even some city folks‚Äîtry to fend off ""envy"" by following an eon-old superstition. They fix a drawing on a wall in their shops or homes showing the palm of an open hand with an open eye in its center. It appears that Foxman and his associates have their own superstition. By decrying the ""deadliest lies"" against American Jewish Zionists, they try to fend off the accusation or the ""envy"" that Jews‚Äîspecifically, Jewish Zionists‚Äîhave power and influence.
Of substance, did Foxman not learn or did anyone inform him about what John Foster Dulles told William Knowland (a pro-Zionist senator from California) back in February 1957? In an exchange about the proposed sanctions to get Israel out of Egyptian territory occupied by Israel in the Suez War, Dulles pronounced these prophetic words, ""We cannot have all our policies made in Jerusalem . . ."" [6]. That was in 1957. Today, all those who deride or deny the charge that Israel has a say on U.S. foreign policy and wars in the Middle East must prove that those who are making this charge are misinformed or just lying.
Interestingly, years after Buchanan made that statement, the successive events proved his sharp assessment and political perspicacity. Two people vindicated his characterization of Capitol Hills as an Israeli-occupied territory"" and both used his words to make the point. The first is a former CIA officer Philip Giraldi, and the second is Philip Weiss, founder of MondoWeiss Website. In an article he wrote in 2011, Giraldi pointed to the Congress as, "" It‚Äôs Still Occupied Territory "". Weiss titled a piece he wrote in 2015 as such: "" Capitol Hill ‚Äî still Israeli-occupied territory "".
At this point, do American Jewish Zionists control the United States? Do they control it as polity or only the political system? Do they have real influence in setting U.S. foreign policy and wars against the Arab and Muslim nations? Or maybe all this talk is no more than baseless allegations?

No Soul-searching by Liberals and US Presstitutes after Clinton's Defeat,"5 Shares

So-called liberals and leftists in the US and around the world, are now wailing and gnashing their teeth in reaction to Hillary Clinton‚Äôs crushing defeat. They are, however, the first to blame for the outcome of the US presidential elections. Their candidate, Hillary Clinton, was the embodiment of a totally corrupt political system. She is a hypocrite par excellence, talking to the bankiers of Wall Street behind closed doors differently than to the American people. Her rhetoric for the rights of women and blacks and other minorities sounded disingenuous. The Clinton Foundation received large donations from Saudi-Arabia and Qatar, countries rewarded in return by huge arms transfers overseen by her as Secretary of State. Her involvement in this corruption was no theme for the media. According to emails published by WikiLeaks, her campaign manager John Podesta was or is on the payroll of the Saudis. All of this was not considered worth reporting by the media. Virtually all national media in the United States supported Clinton's candidacy. Instead of reporting how the machinery of the Democratic Party and the Clinton team stole the primary elections to prevent the candidacy of Bernie Sanders, the media demonized Donald Trump.
I do not wish here to defend Donald Trump. He made numerous stupid, racist, sexist, and anti-Islamic statements that were rightly criticized. Hillary Clinton, on the other hand, was treated with kid gloves while her huge criminal political record was glossed over. Instead of coming to grips with their abject failures, the liberals and their media continue in slandering Donald Trump. Trump‚Äôs first declarations show already that he has conquered new frontiers.
An American President is not a free and politically independent person. From day one, a President-elect can't anymore go around the corner and grab a hot dog or a hamburger. He is reigned in by a military and security establishment that holds the President fit for public consumption. Trump, as any other president, can be expected to follow their rule and political suggestions.
I doubt very much that Trump will keep the promises of his election campaign, such as building a wall along the American-Mexican border, deport all illegal immigrants or ban Muslims from immigrating into the US. I even doubt that he will go after Hillary Clinton and her husband's dubious foundation. There exists a code of honor among thieves.
Trump won precisely because of the shrill one-sided media propaganda and because of his rhetoric against the Washington establishment, including his own Republican Party. Now, this Republican establishment dominates both houses of Congress. Trump belongs also, however, to the US establishment but of another sort. Nobody should believe that the Washington establishment will follow Trump's lead. Even his positive statements about Vladimir Putin or his suggestion to discard NATO, will probably vanish. But what I do hope is that he stands to his rejection of TPP and TTIP and his pragmatic view of Vladimir Putin.

And while he has promised to move the US Embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem, I doubt that he will carry out this provocation against international law and the entire Muslim world.
The German political and media class was not only surprised by the results of the US elections, but did not even try to hide its revulsion against the choice of the American people. The entire political class in Germany perceived and presented the Trump campaign in the same one-sided manner as American media did. Chancellor Angela Merkel sent the President-Elect Trump a warning in the guise of a congratulation. Her political impudence was garbed within obsequious blabber about the allegedly honorable nature of German-American ties: ""Germany and America are bound by common values ‚Äî democracy, freedom, as well as respect for the rule of law and the dignity of each and every person, regardless of their origin, skin color, creed, gender, sexual orientation, or political views. It is based on these values that I wish to offer close cooperation, both with me personally and between our countries‚Äô governments.‚Äù Other German politicians did not even attempt to hide their disdain for American voters by diplomatic language. Germany‚Äôs Foreign Minister Steinmeier called Trump a ""preacher of hate"", and Deputy Chancellor Gabriel cartooned Trump as a ‚Äútrailblazer of a new authoritarian and chauvinist international movement... [who wants] a rollback to the bad old times in which women belonged by the stove or in bed, gays in jail and unions at best at the side table.‚Äù During the election campaign, Trump called Merkel's mass-immigration policy ""insane"" and ‚Äúwhat Merkel did to Germany‚Äù a ‚Äúsad shame‚Äù.
The media and the political class should at this point stop pontificating. Their double morals and unprofessional coverage of the US elections should prompt them to more humility. They should rather blame themselves for their biased reporting, which led directly to Clinton's defeat. Ordinary Americans are not as stupid as the Establishment wants us to believe. Established parties and media would be well advised to give the new US President a chance to prove his worth. There will be, without doubt, many occasions in the future for fact-based criticism.",1
The Unethicality of the Sore Loser,"Moving the goalposts on electoral criteria 34 Shares
15 16 0 3
During live US presidential election coverage on RT, after it became clear that Donald Trump was going to secure the required number of electoral college votes to win the election, word came that Hillary Clinton would not make a concession speech that night. The moderator of the live election coverage at RT was gobsmacked. He called Clinton's behavior the ""epitome of arrogance."" It certainly did smack of being a poor loser.
It seems that being a sore loser has reached stratospheric dimensions, as some are trying to reverse the electoral defeat for Clinton because she won the popular vote. To be clear, there is no comparison to what befell Al Gore here. Gore also won the popular vote in the 2000 US presidential election, but he was considered by many to have won the majority of electoral college votes because of electoral fraud in Florida. Yet even Gore, who has a better case to have overturned his defeat in 2000 than Clinton has in 2016, eventually conceded defeat.
These people seeking to circumvent current electoral college convention are, in other words, trying to move the goalposts on Donald Trump and his supporters.
Moving the goalposts is a type of logical fallacy whereby when a person has met the criteria required to succeed subsequently the criteria are changed to something different or raised to a higher standard (also referred to as ""raising the bar"").
Moving the goalposts is unethical. When it occurs in the sporting world, a penalty is bestowed on the offending team.

What it Signifies for US Democracy
The United States is not a democracy in any meaningful sense. Despite the US relentlessly tooting its own horn as the bastion of democracy, it is arguably inferior in level of democratic attainment even compared to nations it considers nemeses ‚Äî Cuba and China ‚Äî and that it fallaciously derides as being dictatorships.
Conferring victory upon the candidate who garners the plurality of votes in an election will do little to assuage the democratic deficit in the US.
Yes, deciding the outcome of an election through the electoral college vote seems out-dated at any point in time. However, overturning the rules of the game post hoc poses another logical quandary: the slippery slope. If a precedent is set whereby the rules of the game can be changed during play or after the match, then what is to stop the rules being tampered with again in the future when a result is not to a powerful side's liking?
There are many crucial steps required before the United States can present itself as a meaningful democracy: for example, among others, discarding the electoral college, bringing transparency to party primaries, overturning Citizens United , providing impartial and equal media coverage for all candidates (including ""third"" party candidates) during an election, easing the barriers for ""third"" party electoral participation, facilitating electoral participation for all Americans. These measures must be implemented before an election. They must not be implemented during or after an election to change the result. It is unfair. That is elementary morality that any child would comprehend.",1

Mohsen Abdelmoumen : Don't you think that we are in a continuation of the cold war between the USA and its allies in NATO on one side and China and Russia on the other, and who has interest to provoke a confrontation between these superpowers?
Brian Cloughley: It‚Äôs not so much a continuation as a resurrection of the Cold War. After the Warsaw Pact disbanded in March 1991, NATO, although deprived of any reason to continue in existence, managed to keep going, and in 1999 added Poland, the Czech Republic and Hungary to its 16 members. As the BBC noted, these countries became ‚Äúthe first former Soviet bloc states to join NATO, taking the alliance‚Äôs borders some 400 miles towards Russia.‚Äù With good reason Moscow wondered what on earth the US-NATO military alliance might be planning.
In spite of facing no threat whatever from any country in the world, NATO continued to expand around Russia‚Äôs borders, inviting Bulgaria, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Romania, Slovakia and Slovenia to join in 2002, which they did two years later.
As President Putin observed in an interview with Italy‚Äôs Corriere della Sera ‚Äúwe are not expanding anywhere; it is NATO infrastructure, including military infrastructure, that is moving towards our borders. Is this a manifestation of our aggression?‚Äù
The US is also implacably hostile to China and does what it can to provoke it in the South China Sea, but NATO has not yet ventured into Eastern waters.

It is dangerous to indulge in military menaces, but the US appears determined to continue such a policy, and the world as a whole will certainly not benefit from its posture.
How do you explain the silence of the media and Western Governments on the infamous war led by Saudi Arabia against the people of the Yemen?
The most important things are money and oil. Western governments and mainstream media may from time to time make statements that ‚Äúregret‚Äù the Saudi war on Yemen, but they will never take action against the Riyadh royal dictatorship that might make it cease its merciless blitz on the Yemeni people. The US State Department records that in Saudi Arabia its ‚Äúcitizens lack the right and legal means to change their government‚Äù while there are ‚Äúpervasive restrictions on universal rights such as freedom of expression, including on the internet, and freedom of assembly, association, movement and religion; and a lack of equal rights for women . . .‚Äù, but Washington takes no action to encourage the Saudi monarchy to relax or even modify its domestic tyranny.
Saudi Arabia is a valued ally of the United States and indulges in ‚Äútorture and other abuses [and] arbitrary arrest and detention,‚Äù while ‚Äúfreedom of religion is neither recognized nor protected under the law.‚Äù It might be imagined that the President of the United States might feel it proper to indicate his disapproval of the fact that in Saudi Arabia ‚Äúcivil law does not protect human rights, including freedom of the speech and of the press.‚Äù ‚Äî but no US president will ever do anything to discourage the Saudi monarchy from continuing its domestic tyranny and murder of so many innocents in Yemen.
Don‚Äôt you think that, with Hillary Clinton President of the USA, we‚Äôll have a total war, knowing that she is supported by the neocons and the military-industrial complex?
Under a Clinton administration there would have been no cessation of US havoc-wreaking wars around the world, and desperate refugees would have died in their thousands. Her regime would have ensured that the Pentagon‚Äôs fleets continue to go down to the seas in confrontation, and the bombers would have streaked across the skies, deliberately provoking China and Russia. Remember that she is one of the Washington-Brussels war-drum beaters who planned the 2011 aerial blitz on Libya to destroy the government of President Gaddafi, about whose murder she giggled that ‚Äú We came; We saw; He died. ‚Äù The US-NATO attacks on Libya caused massive suffering and destruction, opened the way for feuding bands of militants to fight each other for control of parts of the country, and created a haven for the lunatic extremists of Islamic State [aka ISIS].
Hillary Clinton has not criticised or questioned Obama‚Äôs years of aerial bombardment around the world and her foreign policy adviser, Jeremy Bash, told London‚Äôs Daily Telegraph that she would order a ‚Äúfull review‚Äù of US strategy on Syria as a ‚Äúfirst key task‚Äù of her presidency, resetting the policy to emphasise the ‚Äúmurderous‚Äù nature of the government. He said that Mrs. Clinton would work to get Bashar al-Assad, the Syrian president, ‚Äúout of there.‚Äù
President Assad has been selected as another target for the Clinton policy of ‚ÄúWe came; We Saw; He died,‚Äù and his country appears doomed to a rerun of the Libya fiasco.
If Hillary Clinton had become President of the United States, as seemed only too likely, there would have been even greater emphasis on global airstrikes and military confrontation. Greater turmoil, chaos and catastrophe were to come.
Several reports mention deliveries of Western arms to groups activated in Syria, weapons that ended up in the hands of terrorist groups, such as ISIS-Daesh and al-Nusra. How do you explain the miscalculation of governments that have delivered weapons to terrorists to find these weapons turned against them, as we have seen in various attacks on European soil?
The US supplies weapons to many rebels and insurrectionists around the world. One of the most absurd of these supply chains was in the 1980s when they gave hundreds of Stinger missiles to the Mujahideen in Afghanistan, then had to buy them back for half a million dollars each when it was realised that the Mujahideen were about to use them against civilian airliners. The British have also supplied ground-to-air missiles to insurrectionists groups, with much less publicity but on occasions with serious results. The only explanation for the motives of western governments in doing this sort of thing is that they are poorly informed by their vastly expensive intelligence agencies.
The Americans destroyed Iraq with their ally Tony Blair, Sarkozy made the same thing in Libya with David Cameron, how do you explain that these personalities are not judged, in particular via ICC, authority which judges only African despots?
The International Criminal Court (ICC) ‚Äúinvestigates and, where warranted, tries individuals charged with the gravest crimes of concern to the international community: genocide, war crimes and crimes against humanity.‚Äù But the United States ‚Äúis not at present a party to the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court‚Äù and although Britain and France are in theory supportive of the ICC, there will never ‚Äî ever ‚Äî be a political leader of these countries arraigned before the Court for war crimes or anything else. The African despots it judges are no doubt guilty of heinous crimes, but they are also easy to arraign.
How do you explain that Hillary Clinton's candidacy was maintained while she does not stop making headlines with multiple scandals?
Because the Democrat Party desperately wanted a Democrat president. Members of the Party was prepared to hold their noses with one hand to keep out the stink of Hillary‚Äôs scandals while with the other hand pressing the button to Vote Hillary.
In your opinion, why do Western Governments continue to support old leaders and despotic regimes and to destabilize others according to their interests under the pretext of ""human rights"", ""democracy"", etc.? Who gave them this right?
Nobody gave them the right to support or destroy any government, anywhere, but Western politicians and generals continues to believe that, as in the old colonial days, they have a mission to alter the lives of those they consider inferior. There is flexibility in this policy, however, because if dictators are important for the economies of the West, they are permitted to torture detainees, treat women as chattels, forbid freedom of religion and imprison critics.
Some of our European intelligence sources tell us that there was a mass movement of Daesh towards some countries of Northern Europe, result of the offensive on Daesh in Syria and Iraq. How do you explain that such redeployment towards Europe is possible with all the risks of attack that entails? Don‚Äôt you think that the coordination between European intelligence fails?
I do not believe that there has been mass movement of Daesh/IS adherents to northern Europe.
Libya is a terrorist sanctuary a few kilometers away from Europe. You have an experience in both military and diplomatic, how do you see the resolution of the Libyan equation, is a crisis that can only be resolved militarily or is the policy which should prevail?
Unlike in Saudi Arabia, for example, in Gaddafi‚Äôs prosperous Libya there was freedom of religion and women were regarded as human beings. The entire population received free education and medical care. Then the country was reduced to anarchy by the US-NATO aerial blitz of March-October 2011 (Germany refused to join in), during which, among other devastation, water and oil pipelines and pumping stations were deliberately destroyed. Militia bands took over various parts of the country and continue to fight against each other, while extremist Islamic [Wahhabi] groups have grown in size and influence and the ‚ÄúGovernment of National Accord‚Äù is powerless.
Many of those who energetically supported the war, such as the former secretary general of NATO, Anders Fogh Rasmussen, continue to claim that it was a success ‚Äî ‚Äúa model intervention‚Äù ‚Äî and that it is the fault of ‚Äúthe international community‚Äù that the country is a shambles. But even US President Obama admitted that the war on Libya ‚Äúdidn‚Äôt work‚Äù and that failure to have a plan for the future of the country after the murder of President Gaddafi was ‚Äúthe worst mistake‚Äù of his presidency.
Given that the Obama presidency is in its last months, it is unlikely he will order an invasion of Libya to try to eradicate the Islamic [aka Takfiri] terrorists and rebuild the country he and his allies destroyed. He and his supporters in Europe, notably France and Britain, will continue clandestine ground operations, drone attacks and conventional airstrikes to try to assassinate extremist leaders and destroy their gangs, but these will fail. It is difficult to predict the future in Libya, other than to say that it is most likely that its people will continue suffering the appalling effects of the US-NATO war, and that there will be no peaceful resolution of its problems.
Is the era of the American domination a fatality? Doesn ' t humanity may find it beneficial to see the emergence of a multipolar world ?
It should be remembered that in an August 2014 interview with the New York Times President Obama said ‚ÄúOur participation in the coalition that overthrew Qaddafi [emphasis added] in Libya. I absolutely believed that it was the right thing to do.‚Äù The name of the game is regime change, but America, the ‚Äúindispensable nation‚Äù has failed in its military adventures all over the world and has created widening instability which in turn has led to growth in extremism and terrorism. Unipolarity, with the US possessing and exercising most military power, has not worked.
It appears that multipolarity might be a better alternative, with other nations restraining Washington from unilateral intervention aimed at overthrowing governments, but it is apparent that the US is determined to do all it can to prevent interference in its world domination strategies. In consequence it has engaged in a deliberate policy of confrontation with China and Russia that is entirely counter-productive and could well lead to war. Multipolarity would probably benefit humanity, but that is irrelevant to the indispensable nation.
What do you think of the defeat of Hillary Clinton and the victory of Donald Trump?
Mr. Trump has not elucidated a foreign policy as such, and we can only hope that he will build on the positive indications he has given about America ceasing to meddle militarily all round the world. His greatest achievement would be engage in positive discussions with Russia and China, which would result in vastly diminished tension in east and west. The defeat of Clinton has meant that the threat of US international confrontation has at least diminished, because the world would have been a very dangerous place if she had got in to the White House.

He also said that a terrorist team which was disbanded in Garmsar recently and intended to blow up three tons of explosives in Tehran was affiliated to Riyadh, adding that the arrested terrorists in Garmsar and Tehran had received financial support from Saudi Arabia and had been trained in Iraq's Mosul and Syria's Raqqa.
""We should clearly announce that today, the Saudis are adopting measures against our national security through other countries' embassies, and unfortunately, we see today that certain Arab, African and European embassies are accompanying and uttering similar words like the Saudis (against Iran),"" Hassan Beiki said.
Earlier this week, Head of the Islamic Revolution Guards Corps Public Relations Department General Ramezan Sharif announced that the IRGC forces have dismantled two terrorist groups who sought to carry out sabotage acts inside Iran, adding that they were mercenaries of Saudi Arabia.
""By hollow promises, Saudi Arabia attempted to make the terrorist groups, including Komala and the former Democrat group (Democratic Party of Iran's Kurdistan (Hadka) affiliated to Komala party), to confront the Islamic Republic,"" General Sharif said on Tuesday.

Why Mutual Respect Beats Liberalism - American Herald Tribune,"9 Shares
8 0 0 1
[ Note: Here ""Liberalism"" (capitalized) refers to an approach to just governance based on equality and liberty. Within that broader, philosophical ideology there are narrower, political ideologies ranging from libertarianism, to conservatism, to liberalism (lower case), to democratic socialism. Mutual respect beats all of them, separately or together. ]
We humans are by nature social beings. We live together in organized groups. (Let's call our groups, regardless of size, from hamlets to nation-states, ""communities."")
Ants and bees are social insects. They, too, live in organized groups.
Ants and bees do not have the capacity to decide what the organization of their groups will be. We do.
In fact, we humans have no choice but to decide how a community will be organized, which largely determines how it will function. So, governance is an unavoidable issue for us.
Not to be a spoiler, but the case for using mutual respect for governing governance ends with maximum practical liberty, reinforced political democracy, and a market-based economy. For the citizens of communities with those forms of social organization already in place, the only noticeable changes in their lives would be the elimination of unemployment, poverty, taxation, and public debt‚Äîwell, those things plus passively helping with environmental sustainability.
[Curious readers uninterested in slogging through a philosophical tract can go directly to www.ajustsolution.com (Page: real justice /economics).]
Two ubiquitous processes of human communities
Every human community will always have an economy and a political process. The economy is the process of producing and exchanging goods and services. The political process is the process of effecting choices for the community as a whole. [By ""effecting choices"" I mean choosing among perceived alternatives and taking action to bring that choice to fruition.]
Choosing how the community's economy will be organized is one of the tasks for the political process. (To go with economic laissez faire is to effect a choice.) Choosing how the community's political process will be organized is itself a choice to be effected for the community as a whole.
Organizing principle
The structure and overall functioning of the political process is determined by an organizing principle. That principle can be implicit or explicit, secular or religious, consciously derived or a matter of happenstance. For every human community, though, there is always an organizing principle at work.
History teaches us that there is a 'default value' for the organizing principle of communities. That is to say, there is one organizing principle that will be used if no other one is chosen in its stead. In the absence of any other, the organizing principle of human communities will be 'rule by the most ruthless'.
Understandably, people have sought other organizing principles. The Modern era is defined, socially, by the attempt to use some secular conception of justice as an organizing principle for society. In doing that ideology was invented.
[Karl Marx, whose work has been hugely influential in this era, denied that a principle of justice was at work in his ""scientific"" account of the 'inevitable' development of human society (""dialectical materialism""), but his work definitely had a moral content. Otherwise, there can be nothing wrong with ""exploitation,"" even to the point of slavery. To apply any conception of morality to governance can be said to be an attempt at justice.]
Enter Locke... John Locke
The most influential account of justice in the Modern era is that of John Locke. In Two Treatises of Government , published in 1689 in England, he made equality and liberty the basis of justice. Every Western philosopher since him has been required to endorse or refute equality and liberty.
Equality was the topic of the first of Locke's treatises. Though the thrust of his philosophy was to make governance more secular and less dependent on religion (ideological as opposed to theological), for him equality came from the Bible. In that treatise of his a fundamental moral equality among men is an underlying condition that must be upheld for there to be justice in the governance of a community.
[A claim of moral equality can be purely secular, but in the England of Locke's time that was no more likely than claiming equality for women was. Also, in that time and place, as among so many others, the topic of governance left women out or treated them as property.]
In Locke's second treatise he made a case for liberty as the predicate of justice. He used two accounts of liberty to make that case.
First, Locke asserted that liberty is a 'Natural Right'. He did not invent the idea of Natural Rights. Like so many ideas in Western culture, it can be traced back to the ancient Greeks. It was also discussed by scholars of the medieval Catholic Church‚Äîas grants of a kind ordained by God within the 'Natural Law', i.e. the law 'written on the hearts of men' by the Lord.
The idea of 'rights' was already deeply ingrained in the people populating the British Iles in Locke's time. Natural Rights is one formulation of the idea that there are certain Rights to which all people are entitled merely by virtue of being human (dropping the genderism). Locke said that the Natural Rights are life, liberty, and property. For people who believe in Natural Rights‚Äîor any other form of a priori Rights‚Äîfor any of those Rights to be arbitrarily violated is on the face of it an injustice.
In Locke's other account of liberty as the predicate of justice he started by defining injustice as being ""subject to the arbitrary will"" of another person. Thus, freedom from the arbitrary will of any other person is justice. To be free of the arbitrary will of any other person is obviously at the same time to enjoy liberty. Locke therefore concluded with perfect logic that justice is liberty.
The problem Locke left us
There are all kinds of problems with liberty as the predicate of justice. On the face of it, can people running around doing whatever they want really be relied upon to result in just outcomes?
If justice is liberty, the answer has to be that whatever results from people doing whatever they want is just. Outcomes are beside the point. To see what that would look like, as my good friend who is a doctor is fond of saying, watch any episode of the T.V. show Deadwood . For my money, that show portrays a rather benign version of a community with unconstrained liberty as its organizing principle.
For Locke, the Natural Rights of life and property trump liberty of that kind. Everyone's liberty is constrained by those Rights. Yet, liberty itself is also a Right. Bertrand Russell said that Locke was a ""successful"" philosopher because every time he saw a contradiction looming he simply changed the subject.
When constraints are put on liberty to achieve justice, then those constraints become the real determiners of justice. In that case, outcomes do enter into the evaluation of justice. Liberty becomes one possible ""social good"" (from John Rawls) among others.
Setting aside more philosophical complaints and the chances for violent mayhem ending in rule by the most ruthless, focusing on rights, especially Rights, begets a self-centered approach to life. It's all about ' my right' to do this, have that, etc.
Rights are the basis of governance in the U.S. I blame that approach to governance for the incivility and the loathing to take other people into account that in my observation pervade this nation these days.
Turning to mutual respect
Don't get me wrong. I love liberty. I very much doubt anyone could love it more than I do.
There is a better way, however, to achieve liberty. That way is mutual respect. As a practical matter, mutual respect would maximize the liberty that co-existing people can enjoy simultaneously. ""Practical"" liberty is (as opposed to some idealized, hypothetical concept) 'real liberty', the liberty we experience in our day-to-day lives.
At bottom, ""respect"" in this context simply means taking other people into account. As an ethic it can operate on the personal level, in business, for the structure and overall functioning of the economy, and for the political process itself.
[Readers should note that having the economy be passively governed by mutual respect would relieve it of being actively governed, as it is at present, by government and a quasi-governmental central bank.]
Mutual respect has a history in Western philosophy, too. It is present in the moral philosophies of both Immanuel Kant and G.W.F. Hegel (ranked one and two, in one order or the other, on most people's lists of 'greatest Modern philosophers'). It is also present in utilitarianism.
For that matter, any philosophy that includes, explicitly or implicitly, a belief in human equality includes a presumption of mutual respect. Adopting mutual respect for governing governance does not depend on that or any other belief, but a belief in equality does bring a requirement of mutual respect with it.
Back to Locke for mutual respect
The mutual respect implicit in a belief in equality is manifested in Locke's thought as equal respect for people's Natural Rights. When Locke used a dialectical argument to make liberty the predicate of justice he was standing right in front of mutual respect, but was facing the wrong way, as it were.
Recall that he defined injustice as being subject to the arbitrary of any other person. The opposite of being in that condition is justice. Since the opposite of being subject to the arbitrary will of anyone else is at the same time being at liberty, Locke surmised that justice is liberty.
On the other hand, there is a conclusion to be reached from Locke's starting point that is every bit as logical as the one Locke made. Philosophically, this conclusion beats his because it is more immediate, it raises no contradictions, and it does not result in a predicate of justice that itself must be constrained to prevent rule by the most ruthless. Practically, unlike equality per se and unconstrained liberty, taking this route to justice can efficaciously achieve just governance of both the economy and the political process while maximizing liberty.
[The most focused readers will have noticed that Locke's definition of injustice must itself be substantiated, but we can leave that for another day. Besides, I've never seen it disputed except, indirectly, by Frederick Nietzsche and Ayn Rand in their hyper-romantic mode.]
Here it is: if injustice is being subject to the arbitrary will of any other person, then justice requires that everyone refrain from subjecting any other person to one's own arbitrary will.
When people are doing that, justice is the result. No constraints on such behavior are needed.
To refrain from arbitrarily subjecting other people to one's will is to take other people into account. To take other people into account is to respect them. So, most simply the predicate of justice is mutual respect.
Closing
As I said at the beginning of this little essay, using mutual respect to govern governance would maximize practical liberty, reinforce political democracy, and retain the definitive institutions of the market-based economy. Applying it to the economy would allow us to eliminate unemployment, poverty, taxes, and public debt while passively enhancing our chances for environmental sustainability. It would also provide a universal ethic to govern personal interactions and the conduct of business.
How all of that follows from recognizing mutual respect as the predicate of justice is not all that difficult or complicated, but it is more than can be addressed in one essay. Much, much more is available for consideration at www.ajustsolution.com .",1
Russian Navy Fleet Starts Strikes at Terrorists' Positions in Syria's Aleppo,"BY AHT Staff Russian Navy Fleet Starts Strikes at Terrorists' Positions in Syria's Aleppo Russian warships deployed in Syrian waters targeted the terrorist groups' positions in the Western part of Aleppo city and in the Eastern side of the town of al-Bab, inflicting major damage on the militants, an expert in strategic affairs disclosed on Saturday. 5 Shares 0 1 
Kamal al-Jafa termed Moscow's Kaliber cruise missile attacks on terrorist centers in Western Aleppo city and the town of al-Bab, North of the city, as a sign of the crucial role that the Russian naval forces are to play in Aleppo's Large-Scale Military Operation. 
""The attacks came as preparations for the implementation of al-Bab operation are over now,"" al-Jafa said. 
""Turkey tries to increase its role in the diplomatic settlement of Syrian crisis via its influence in al-Bab region,"" he added. 
""If the Syrian army seizes control of al-Bab within the framework of a coalition with Russia and Iran and diplomatic and logistical support of China, the aspirations and plans of the US, Turkey and even Saudi Arabia will fall flat and the Syrian government's sovereignty in Northern Syrian will be expanded,"" the expert underscored. 
A Russian military and diplomatic source had disclosed earlier today that the Russian fighter jets on 'Admiral Kuznetsov' aircraft carrier and the country's navy fleet would start strikes on terrorists in Aleppo in Northern Syria soon. MORE... The Criminal West‚Äôs State Sponsorship of Terrorism 
""Russian warplanes, on board the Kuznetsov aircraft carrier, will soon hit the positions and gatherings of the terrorist groups in Aleppo,"" the source said. 
""Mig 29 and Sukhoi 33 fighter jets have taken off Admiral Kuznetsov' aircraft carrier in recent days and have carried out reconnaissance operations over Syria,"" the source added. 
""Mig 29 and Sukhoi 33 fighter jets' reconnaissance flights were aimed at identifying the new positions of the terrorists and preparing a list of terrorist targets to hand over to the navy fleet (a cruiser and destroyer),""the sources went on to say. 
""The Russian fleet, including Admiral Kuznetsov aircraft carrier, 'Pyotr Veliky' nuclear power guided missile cruiser and Admiral Gregorowich destroyer are ready for military operation,"" the source underlined. 
Sources in the Russian Defense Ministry disclosed on Tuesday that the country's aircraft carrier group was ready to launch a strike targeting terrorists in the province of Aleppo. 
The source told Russia's Gazeta that the attack, which would likely engage Kalibr cruise missiles, would target militants outside Aleppo, and not the residential areas. 
The group, which includes Russia's 'Admiral Kuznetsov' aircraft carrier, 'Pyotr Veliky' nuclear power guided missile cruiser and two destroyers, completed its transfer to the Mediterranean Sea and is getting ready to strike, the Defense Ministry source said. 
""The group's main goal is to carry out missile strikes on terrorists outside of Aleppo that are attempting to get into the city"", the source added. 
He also said that Kalibr cruise missiles would be used in the strikes, but did not specify from which ships the missiles would be launched. 
No Russian surface ship that was currently in the Med was capable of firing the Kalibr-NK missiles, but submarine-launched Kalibr-PL could be used in the strike. The surface-launched type of Kalibr missile could also be launched from the Caspian Sea. 
Final details of the strike were being worked out, the source told Gazeta.ru, including zeroing in on the terrorists' locations, finding out the details of their transport routes, base camps and storage and training facilities. 
""The strikes will avoid the city of Aleppo to prevent civilian casualties, because terrorists continue to use city residents as human shields."" 
Early in November, a Russian naval group, headed by Admiral Kuznetsov aircraft carrier and the battle cruiser Peter the Great, arrived in the Mediterranean Sea, causing quite a stir in the West.",1

ISIS terrorists have executed scores more people around the northern Iraqi city of Mosul this week and are reported to be stockpiling dangerous chemicals in civilian areas, the U.N. human rights office said on Friday.
A mass grave with over 100 bodies found in the town of Hammam al-Alil was one of several ISIS killing grounds, spokeswoman Ravina Shamdasani said. She cited testimony gleaned from sources including a man who had survived an execution of some 50 former Iraqi soldiers by playing dead.
""Clearly there are many other killing fields. We also have reports of other mass graves which we haven‚Äôt yet been able to verify,‚Äù Shamdasani told reporters, mentioning sites at Mosul airport and the village of Tal al-Thahab.
 Iraqi troops had found large stockpiles of sulfur and there were credible reports that ISIS had used ""phosphor projectiles"" over Qayyara, close to Mosul, Shamdasani said.
""Similar credible reports in Mosul state that they have placed sulfur pits in close proximity to civilians,"" she said.

Shamdasani said 40 civilians were reportedly shot on Tuesday for ""treason and collaboration"" with Iraqi government forces, and their bodies hung from electrical poles around Mosul.

Defeating White Liberalism in the Age of Trump,"11 Shares

I grew up in a working class family and have experienced the deep racism of a society that views Vietnamese Americans as the targets of war. I've lived through successive Democratic Party administrations with little to celebrate. The Bill Clinton era brought NAFTA, which outsourced my Aunt's union job and forced her into the low-wage service sector. My mother never found a living wage job and relied on my father's public sector union position to meet our family's needs. In the 21st century, Obama expanded Bush‚Äôs War on Terror, which merged my father‚Äôs job with into the Department of Homeland Security.
Downward pressure on wages and working conditions forced my father to refinance our home multiple times to pay college expenses for my sister and I. Even then, my sister and I graduated with large sums of student debt. I have worked four jobs in three years and only one has paid a truly living wage. Another four years of a Democratic Party President was not going to make anything better for my family. That is not to say that Donald Trump was the answer to the structural problems of exploitation. But Trump's victory is not the end of the world, either.
Trump's victory is the product of global capitalism‚Äôs decay. Millions of people voted for Trump for a variety of reasons, namely because he clearly labeled problems and outlined solutions to them. I don‚Äôt agree with all of his solutions. White nationalism stains his domestic and international agenda. Trump‚Äôs call to further militarize the US-Mexico border yet make peace with Russia is a contradiction in and of itself. A white nationalist billionaire who speaks the language of racism on the one hand and the interests of peace on the other is not exactly a model of consistency.
However, Trump‚Äôs consistency is not the most important aspect of this election. Millions of people have shown their disgust with the two-party system of the capitalist class. A number of mostly white workers and whites from the petty business class voted for Trump. Trump also received more votes than expected from the Black and Latino electorate. Meanwhile, the elections produced a low turnout for Clinton from the historic Democratic Party bases of Black voters, Latino voters, and women voters. Clinton may have won the electoral vote, but the balance of forces ensured the ruling class would gamble on Trump. Trump's base of white workers and petty business elites angered by thirty years of monopoly capitalist assault are more of a threat at the moment than the millions of Democratic party voters who are now without a home. The round table of elites called the Electoral College could not afford any more damage to the Democratic Party than what transpired during the election.
So the Democratic Party is now on its deathbed and there is only one class of people willing to resurrect it: white liberals. A large section of the Democratic Party base wanted Bernie Sanders to be their next President. They did not hold their nose for Clinton. The legitimate concerns that immigrants and oppressed people possess with Trump's racism should not be led into the bowels of the Democratic Party. Yet for white liberals, this is the ultimate mission.

Brian Cloughley: ‚ÄúThe Greatest Achievement of Mr. Trump would be Engage in Positive Discussions with Russia and China‚Äù Arise President Trump (or Why it's not the End of the World as We Know it) Trump's sexual predator characteristics - His Grandfather was a pimp, but at least he paid the women he hired The significance of the GOP's attempted purge of Donald Trump Trump's victory has energized the white liberal section of the United States to fight back. White liberals began the process in a deep state of mourning over Clinton's loss. They then placed blame for Trump‚Äôs victory on Russia, low-voter turnout, and the white working class. White liberals have blamed everyone except Hillary Clinton and the Democratic Party. Now, white liberals in the US hope to wage a crusade against Trump in hopes of a Democratic Party recovery. It is all too clear that their primary intention is to get ahead of the genuine forces that rejected both Trump and Clinton and lead them into the Democratic Party graveyard.
White liberals love to hide their own racism and ruling class sensibilities through a process of appeal and betrayal. They speak with the authority of moral righteousness on the one hand and the knife of oppression on the other. They talk down to the struggle of peoples oppressed by white supremacy and attempt to steer it in a way that benefits their class interests. White liberals despise the working class because they understand that there will come a day when it destroys the system that they profit so handsomely from.
White liberals usually originate from the ruling class, the managerial class, and various stripes of the professionalized sector. Their class has ordained themselves the true leaders of ""human rights"" based on race, gender, and sexual equality. However, White liberals speak of human rights on the basis of a complete abandonment of the material struggle for liberation. In other words, the white liberal is the ultimate counterrevolutionary force in US society. It has wielded the so-called struggle for human rights as a weapon to prevent the emergence of class-consciousness among the oppressed and its genuine leaders.
The 2016 elections have shown that the broad class arrangement of white liberals is indeed in crisis and only has itself to blame. White liberals cannot acknowledge that it was their brand of politics that led to the Trump moment. Their dominance over the left in the US ensured that no organized force existed strong enough to challenge the ills of capitalist decline. Millions of people voted for Sanders based on his demands for material relief. Millions of people voted for Trump for the similar reasons, his racism and sexism notwithstanding. Whatever racism and sexism existed in his rhetoric could not ""trump"" the fact that the trade deals and wars he spoke out against in part drove ordinary people to vote for him. If the Trump base wanted racism and sexism primarily, they would of voted for Ted Cruz or Jeb Bush in the primaries.
So White liberal anger about Trump's victory is not directed at sexism, racism, or any other aspect of Trump's politics. White liberals are afraid of the sharpening contradictions of US society that threaten to squeeze them out of their privileged position under the racist and capitalist order. Millions of people are now asking where white liberalism was during the massive loss in working class income and wealth that occurred over the last forty years? Where were the White liberals during the endless wars that have been waged even more fervently by Democratic Party Administrations? Where were the White liberals during the erection of the largest police and prison state in the world, the institutions that murder and incarcerate Black Americans in record numbers and deport undocumented peoples at historic rates?
The answer is that white liberals were supporting the US capitalist system's assault on the oppressed every step of the way. This is what they are trying to hide with their anger over Trump. We cannot defeat Trump's white nationalism if the white liberal is not defeated with just as much vigor. White liberal ideology has a history of infecting social movements. As it spreads, it breeds the germs of Democratic Party control over these movements. But the Democratic Party made its own bed by acting as the more effective evil of the ruling class. If a powerful movement of the working class is to emerge in the age of Trump, then we must fight hard against the white liberal forces working hard to resuscitate the Democratic Party and build an independent party of our own.",1
"China Warns Trump against Abandoning Climate Change Deal, Increases Climate Change Aid to Developing Countries to $ 3.1b","Trump win opens way for China to take climate leadership role. 3 Shares

China has warned Donald Trump that he will be defying the wishes of the entire planet if he acts on his vow to back away from the Paris climate agreement after he becomes US president next January.
The election of climate change skeptic Donald Trump as president is likely to end the U.S. leadership role in the international fight against global warming and may lead to the emergence of a new and unlikely champion: China.
‚ÄúIt is global society‚Äôs will that all want to co-operate to combat climate change,‚Äù a senior Beijing negotiator said in Morocco on Friday, at the first round of UN talks since the Paris deal was sealed last December. The Chinese negotiators added that ‚Äúany movement by the new US government‚Äù would not affect their transition towards becoming a greener economy.
China worked closely with the administration of outgoing President Barack Obama to build momentum ahead of the 2015 Paris Agreement on climate change. The partnership of the two biggest greenhouse gas emitters helped get nearly 200 countries to support the pact at the historic meet in France's capital.
By contrast, Trump has called global warming a hoax created by China to give it an economic advantage and said he plans to remove the United States from the historic climate agreement, as well as reverse many of Obama's measures to combat climate change.
MORE... Canadian Big Media ignoring responsibility by failing to cover climate change crisis Petition calls for DOJ investigation into ExxonMobil's denial of climate science Zou Ji, deputy director of the National Centre for Climate Change Strategy and a senior Chinese climate talks negotiator, told Reuters that if Trump abandons efforts to implement the Paris agreement, ""China's influence and voice are likely to increase in global climate governance, which will then spill over into other areas of global governance and increase China's global standing, power and leadership.""
China is expected to play a pivotal role in consolidating and enhancing South-South partnership, particularly when it comes to issues related to climate change.
China is steadily ramping up efforts to assist other developing countries in addressing climate change, a gesture that has received wide welcome.
Speaking to the Chinese news agency Xinhua, Moroccan Foreign Minister and Climate Change Conference (COP22) President Salaheddine Mezouar said that China has an ‚Äúextremely important role to play in accompanying, reinforcing and boosting South-South partnership and support sustainable development policies in the African continent‚Äù.
Xie Ji, deputy chief of the Chinese delegation to the ongoing 22nd session of the Conference of the Parties (COP 22), said on Nov. 7 that China has ironed out a concrete program to help other developing countries to become more climate-resilient. ""We will help build up ten low-carbon pilot zones, launch 100 climate change mitigation and adaptation projects, and offer training programs for 1,000 climate-related professionals,"" he said.
What Xie called the ""10-100-1000"" project is part of the effort that China has made in recent years to help other developing countries fight against climate change. The country has earmarked a total of 580 million yuan (about US$85 million) since 2011 to help developing countries, according to Zhang Yucheng, deputy director of the International Cooperation Division of the Department of Climate Change of the National Development and Reform Commission (NDRC).
The most recent offer is the South-South Climate Cooperation Fund, a US$3.1 billion fund pledged by Chinese President Xi Jinping last September to help developing countries address climate issues.",1

 Book title: True Islam, Jihad, and Terrorism: The Science of Islamic Foreign Policy ‚Äì Jaan S. Islam
 Publisher: New York: Nova Science Publishers
 ISBN 978-1-63485-542-6.
 At a time of politics of fear, Jaan Islam counters fear with knowledge in his masterpiece, True Islam, Jihad and Terrorism (Nova Science Publishers, New York, 2016). During the 2016 US election, it has become clear world peace and security is connected to the state of Islam and how it is understood in today‚Äôs context. This is a very timely book that fills a gap in the western society about Islamic history, philosophy, and political science. This book presents the Islamic political philosophy as represented in the writings of great Muslim thinkers and scholars such as Ibn Khaldun. Jaan Islam uses the so-called ‚ÄòIslamic cognition technique‚Äô and starts the book with a chapter dedicated to Islamic cognition. This chapter on cognition itself is a paradigm shift in the modern research scholarship and can be considered for advancing knowledge in other fields. Such an extension was first pointed by Islam, Zatzman and Islam (2013) in their ground-breaking work on educational curriculum.
MORE... Stop using millenary religions as a scapegoat for the crimes of Modern Imperialism Another Ramadan for Muslims amid sufferings A conversation on equality, integration and Islam as a religious marker An open letter to young Muslims everywhere: The seed of triumph in every adversity Following the tradition of early Islamic scholars, Jaan Islam presented all theories in the book with evidence from the primary Islamic sources, Qur'an and authenticated traditions of the prophet . These sources were completely ignored in the in the Orientalist (now it has morphed into neo-Orientalism) writings, which led to the inundation of the post 9/11 world with disinformation and agenda-driven ‚Äòresearch‚Äô about Islamic history. The distinction between this book and these agenda-driven ones gives the book a special value.
 Although the book explains the Islamic foundations of political science and governance, it should not be looked at as a book of theology. It is a dogma-free approach that has been characterized as truly scientific elsewhere . Quite appropriately, the author starts off with a brilliant narration of Islamic cognition. It has been all but forgotten in the west that Islam is the religion that started the tradition of dogma-free, truly scientific cognition. The west does recognize Averr√∂es, the famous Islamic scholar as the father of secular philosophy, whereas brands Islam as just another religion, similar to Christianity, infected with doctrinal philosophy. It is no surprise that with that starting point, Islam remains the most misunderstood religion in the west.
Chapter 3 of the book deals with fundamental philosophies of three major philosophers, namely Hobbes, Locke and Ibn Khaldun. In this chapter, the author debunks another myth, that is Ibn Khaldun‚Äôs political theory is somehow similar to those of Hobbes and Locke. Ibn Khaldun, the father of social science, indeed had a very different starting point in his cognition. The author points out how Ibn Khaldun‚Äôs first premise was Shahadah that formed the basis of the cognition axis by using Qur‚Äôan as the origin and prophet Muhammad‚Äôs life (through the book of Hadith) as the pivotal point. One the other hand, Locke had placed himself as the pivotal point, whereas Hobbes eliminated any cognition point. The author makes it clear that both Hobbes‚Äô and Locke‚Äôs cognition tools are just as illogical as dogmatic cognition. In my researched opinion, this accurate distinction has not been made by any other author on the topic. It is because the eastern authors do not know about Hobbes and Locke and the western authors do not know about Islamic cognition that was obviously alive and well with Ibn Khaldun.
In Chapter 4, the author uses the case laws of the prophet and his four rightly guided caliphs (known as Rashedun Caliphs). Clearly, the author‚Äôs intention is to understand how the prophet and his closest followers went to war or which verses of the Qur‚Äôan they were enacting. For the first time anyone took this approach and not surprisingly, the author comes up with four rigid criteria from the Qur‚Äôan. No other author to the best of my knowledge connected them to specific wars that the prophet and his companions engaged in. This finding helps the author establish jus ad bellum that can explain every war that shaped the foundation of the young Islamic state of the time.
Similar to Chapter 4, the author discovers jus ad bello in Islamic jurisprudence in Chapter 5. Once again, the case laws are presented and analyzed in such a manner, one can take any new example and evaluate it to call it permissible or not. The theoretical basis for critiquing any modern warfare is set in this chapter.
In Chapter 6, the author addresses a difficult topic. When is it allowed or even mandatory to rebel against a head of state? It is often stated that Islam is a complete code of life. The author makes it clear that Islam didn‚Äôt leave anything to imagination and has left a strict criterion and modus operandi for any imaginable crisis that can occur at any time. The important question arises as to when a head of state that once claimed to have divine authority can be removed or when a head of state can be declared unfit and it becomes mandatory for the citizens to remove him or wage war if necessary. This is not an easy topic to cover even in today‚Äôs world. The author covers it with dexterity from an epoch he considers as exemplary. The history is not pretty and there is room for controversy as often the history is written by the victor and clearly after the demise of the rightly guided Caliphate, the victors were no longer rightly guided. The author weaves through this difficult process and makes it clear for the readership. This chapter can be an eye opener even for a student of Islam that has spent lifetime on the topic.
Often when Islamic criteria are discussed, eyes roll and eye brows furrow in disbelief. If it is all that simple, why don‚Äôt Islamic scholars have consensus? The author handles this topic like a pro. In Chapter 7, he analyzes current Islamic scholars and deconstructs their thought process. He has kind words for some but has nothing but scorn for the self-righteous, apologist ‚Äòscholars‚Äô that have done great disservice to Islam and/or scientific cognition process. One doesn‚Äôt have to be personal, but the writing is so clear, one can hardly afford to not get angry at certain genre of scholars. To anyone‚Äôs surprise, this list is not made out of anti-Islamic non-Muslim scholars.
Chapter 8 is where proof of the pudding appears. The author analyzes every major event of today‚Äôs political arena and analyzes it with the Islamic criteria of both jus ad bello and jus ad bellum. The author comes up with an index to rank various countries and groups. Most interesting is the discussion on current US allies, such as Saudi Arabia, and how they rank among the biggest offenders of Islam and Islamic laws. This is not a topic for the faint of heart but the author did an excellent job making it easily readable, punctuated with numerous riveting arguments.
Chapter 9 is the conclusion and recommendation. I have studied Islam for some 30 years and yet I found these conclusions novel and entirely logical. I doubt anyone would agree with the conclusions unless of course that person reads the entire book prior to reading the conclusion. It is important to read the book in sequence.
Chapter 10 lists the bibliography and references. It is many pages long and is quite comprehensive.
Chapter 11 is the Appendix that lists the letters of the prophet. It is a great idea to give the letters in original Arabic, so there is no room for misinterpretation, let alone disinformation.
Anyone with knowledge of Islam knows that Jihad is in the core of Islam and this book shows it is so and there needs to be no apology. Quite interestingly, the author even depicts Jihad as the roof of Islam. Without the roof, the Fort of Islam has no protection whatsoever. This depiction captures the essence of protection, security, as well as integrity and puts away the notion of Jihad being a weapon for Crusade like aggression.
This book belongs to the desk of any researcher interested in knowing about Islam or what Islam can do to bring about peace on earth in order to live out the true meaning of the word, Islam that means peace through submission to the creator. This book is equally useful for anyone interested in pursuit of peace and harmony that is truly elusive in today‚Äôs world. In this sense, this book is a manual for world governance in peace.",1

Citizens of the United States have chosen the wealthy businessman, Donald Trump, as their new President. Trump, who was considered a wild card candidate, will take control of the country in January to fill his four year term. Violent protests are raging and attacks against those who oppose Trump or fail to fit his criteria of acceptability are on the rise. Trump supporters have also been attacked. To say the very least, this is the dawning of a new age in America. To put it mildly, Trump alienated huge swaths of humanity during his campaign. Women, Mexicans, Muslims, Blacks, the media‚Ä¶ have all taken their turns at his whipping pole. Trump‚Äôs harsh words have been used to condemn huge groups. The only people Trump hasn‚Äôt attacked are White American males.
The only people Trump hasn‚Äôt attacked are White American males.
Interestingly, Trump shares many traits with the man who brought Germany to its knees during WWII, Adolph Hitler. Hitler rallied Germans by directing national anger toward two primary groups, the Communists and the Jews. Trump rallied Americans by directing high doses of anger toward Mexico and Muslims. Trump‚Äôs perception of Mexican immigrants is way off the mark, as the majority of those who emigrate to the US are hard working people willing to perform roles most White Americans avoid, like field harvesting. Nonetheless, Trump has described them as rapists and criminals, tossing a blanket over every human being who finds their way to the US through illegal means.
When it comes to Muslims, Mr. Trump is exceptionally ignorant. He fulfills the thoughts of those in the Middle East who already believe the US has a long range plan to eliminate Islam.
Millions of Americans are having a meltdown over the election of Trump, while those who supported his bid for presidency continue to express anger and simultaneously, imitate Trump‚Äôs bully demeanor by attacking those who disagree with their point of view, particularly in social media. Insults have never been so foul and widespread. Everyone is riled, people are unsure of what to do. It seems almost certain that things are going to get a lot worse before they could ever get better.

One thing is certain, Donald Trump is extremely willing to toss out ideas and positions and then change his mind the following day. Unfortunately, Trump did this when initially exposing the connection between Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton and ISIS.
It is an absolute fact that the United States was directly responsible for starting two more wars in the Middle East, in Syria and Libya. Both conflicts were deadly and destabilizing and waged at the request of Israel, as a Wikileaks cable recently confirmed. The mere idea that nations are trampled this way cements our understanding of how Obama and Clinton operate. It also speaks volumes about the dark ways that the US has been manipulated by the Zionist government of Israel, a nation that drains US taxpayers of more than $4 million a day. The track record of human rights violations in Israel goes well beyond unforgivable.
The ISIS expose was a golden moment for Trump, even though he didn‚Äôt stick to his guns. The wars the US has been waging in recent years are all unjustified conflicts used to make large amounts of money for groups like Halliburton and mercenary organizations. While the US government spends trillions on killing, it has historically ignored the suffering its allies direct toward their own citizens. One great example is Saudi Arabia, the radical Wahhabi government that still beheads people in public in strict violation of international law.These problems have sullied US support for many years.
The only hope for the future lies in peace and reconciliation. For Clinton, maintaining peace was a seemingly impossible task. Lest we forget it was her threats of war toward Russia and Iran that crossed the line for large numbers of Americans. Parading as a liberal, Hillary Clinton‚Äôs warmongering is legendary. The Democratic National Committee debacle that derailed the only promising candidate, Bernie Sanders, was equally reprehensible.
In the end, there were no good choices for US voters. The pro-Trump crowd may not feel as victorious once they realize that Mr. Trump does not care about them in any way, shape or form. Only days after the election, it is already being announced that the tax cuts Trump promised will only be a fraction of what he claimed, it is reminiscent of former US President George Bush's famous words, ""Read my lips: no new taxes"". Of course each man offered the promise as an election gimmick, each time it was enough to convince Republicans. Trump is here to promote his own needs and to meet his own goals. Perhaps some of his political moves will coincide with the wishes of his voters, perhaps not.
In the meanwhile tempers are flaring, and Americans are increasingly turning against each other. The real unavoidable truth is that Donald Trump will be the next US President. He says he is going to make America great again and many of us wonder exactly what that means. In the post-WWII years there was peace, unless you were Black. Americans had freedom, unless they were women or minorities.
The United States has always waged illegal wars, dating back to the very beginning when one treaty with Native people after another, was broken. Is Donald Trump going to keep the US out of wars for the next four years? It would be a very good thing if he did.
On one hand, it seems entirely doubtful that the country will make it through four years of Donald Trump, but giving up is not the answer. If Trump goes too far out of sync, or becomes embroiled in charges that he can't pay off or threaten away, there is an impeachment process that Americans can follow.",1
Saudi Arabia Warns Trump on Blocking Oil Imports: FT,"Kingdom‚Äôs energy minister says move would risk damaging the US economy. 2 Shares

Saudi Arabia has warned Donald Trump that the incoming US president will risk the health of his country‚Äôs economy if he acts on his election promises to block oil imports.
Over the course of the two-year American election process, Republican nominee Trump promised on the campaign trail to divest U.S. interests from ‚Äúour foes and the oil cartels,‚Äù referring mainly to the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC), of which the KSA is the largest producer and de facto leader.
‚ÄúAt his heart President-elect Trump will see the benefits and I think the oil industry will also be advising him accordingly that blocking trade in any product is not healthy,‚Äù Khalid al-Falih , chairman of Aramco and Saudi Aramco Oil Minister, told the Financial Times in Marrakesh, where world leader‚Äôs are currently negotiating the nuts and bolts of the landmark 2015 climate change agreement.
Saudi Arabia is the U.S.‚Äô largest Middle Eastern oil supplier, though the North American country gets most of its energy from domestic and Canadian sources.
Al-Falih added that the free trade energy culture currently in place benefits the United States because it has created a refining industry and ignited a job-hungry shale revolution.

The occupied mentality Syndrome ‚ÄúThe U.S. is sort of the flag-bearer for capitalism and free markets,‚Äù according to Al-Falih. ‚ÄúThe U.S. continues to be a very important part of a global industry that is interconnected, that is dealing with a fungible commodity which is crude oil. So having equalization through free trade is very healthy for oil.‚Äù
During Presidential race Donald Trump had blamed Saudi Arabia for the 9/11 terrorist attacks and in March, the real estate magnate said he would consider stopping US oil purchases from Saudi Arabia and other Arab allies unless the Saudi government provided ground troops to fight ISIS.
NY Daily News revealed Trump sold the 45th floor of Trump World Tower to the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia for $4.5 million in June 2001, according to a city Finance Department spokeswoman. In 2008, the apartments became part of the Saudi Mission to the United Nations, records show.
The reports emerged back then revealed the reality of Trump's relations with the Riyadh regime; but Mr Trump has not always expressed a positive view of the Middle Eastern country.",1
Don't Make Universities Instruments of Assault on Marginalized Peoples,"A Plea from California to Not Replicate in Canada the Attacks on the Academic Careers of Steven Salaita and Norman Finkelstein for Opposing ""the Persecution of the Indigenous Arab Populations of the Occupied Territories."" 3 Shares

TO THE EDITOR OF THE LETHBRIDGE HERALD ON NOVEMBER 15, 2016.
As an American with Canadian friends, I have been following with some interest and concern the unfolding story of Anthony Hall‚Äôs recent suspension from his position at the .
I have looked to our northern neighbour as one admires a wiser, older sibling. Canadians to me seem less radical, less extreme, and more ethical than my own more reactive countrymen and women. Canada, after all, accepted our draft dodgers of the ‚Äô70s who questioned the morality and justness of the Vietnam War. To me, that was something to be lauded. Imagine my chagrin upon learning that a university professor with a 30-year career, who encourages critical analysis and social responsibility, had been suspended without pay, apparently without a formal and unprejudiced investigation occurring first.
Hall‚Äôs suspension reminds me of the famous cases of two American academics, Steven Salaita and Norman Finkelstein. Both were openly critical of Zionism and spoke against the marginalization and persecution of the indigenous Arab populations of the Occupied Territories. Both were ostracized publicly for their vocal support of Palestinian rights and lost their jobs.
I adjure the not to take a page out of the American playbook by punishing academics who dare to speak up for the marginalized peoples of the world. Please live up to the values of the wiser, more ethical and socially conscientious northern neighbour you have always represented for Americans like myself.

As radicalism and hatred continue to empty their venom onto the world: sowing discord, enmity, and self-righteous arrogance, a group of Shia Muslim entrepreneurs from Iran, Saudi Arabia, Pakistan, Iraq and the US, imagined a technology which would speak unity amid furious sectarianism, and cohesion where there was distrust.
Keen not only denounce but oppose the ideological abomination which is Wahhabism ‚Äì this dogma the House of Saud rose atop the fanaticism of one heretic scholar: Muhammad Ibn Abdel-Wahhab (18th century) Muslims have chosen to anchor their rebuttal of extremism through the promotion of a new media platform Messenger 40.
will likely argue that another social media platform is hardly revolutionary ‚Ä¶ especially if we consider how many apps are already available, this one particular product defiantly taps into a religious movement and expression Wahhabist Saudi Arabia has worked to silence.
What in the world am I talking about?
I am referring to Resistance ‚Ä¶ more particularly social resistance through the affirmation of Islam‚Äôs most sacred and universal principle: Justice.

It is our refusal to bow to tyranny and accept oppression which prompted communities of man to rise against the Establishment, and from the ashes of empires dream themselves free.
Today such principles have been packaged into an app ‚Ä¶ several lines of coding put together to defy Saudi Arabia‚Äôs radical construct, a tool to break free from the shackles of religious oppression.

here is where Messenger 40 really promises to break the social sound barrier ‚Äì beyond a simple exercise in technological entrepreneurship and an imperious need to reject theo-fascism, Messenger 40 carries the very essence of Islam‚Äôs tradition in it name: Arbaeen.
Arbaeen means 40 in Arabic, a reference to the mourning of Imam Hussain ibn Ali, the grandson of the Prophet Muhammad, and Third Imam of Islam.
A symbol of fortitude, courage, and exceptional piety, Imam Hussain‚Äôs name has long echoed of Islam‚Äôs most brilliant principles - that before Tyranny none should relent, that even in the most suffocating of darkness it is Truth which must be spoken, beyond self-interest, and beyond all fears.
It is those principles Messenger 40 ambition to promote by speaking Freedom in a region locked in oppression ‚Äì all thanks to Saudi Arabia‚Äôs desire to project hatred onto a faith it has proclaimed ownership over.
Should you have missed the momentous act of resistance this one app represents, I would like to remind you that Saudi Arabia still forbids women to drive ‚Ä¶ that and a few other wonderful vapid social restrictions.

"Won, Now What?","18 Shares

Trump's victory was a shock to most, especially given the broad support Hillary Clinton received from the forces of Wall Street. Although Trump is a billionaire himself, his criticism of free trade agreements and US policy toward Russia angered a broad section of the ruling class. It is the ruling class in control of the banks, military institutions, and corporate boardrooms that usually determine elections in the United States. Trump's victory is a product of the ruling system's decline and crisis more than anything else. The question is, now what?
What is urgently needed is a deep investigation of all aspects and contradictions of the Trump moment. First, Trump won because the capitalist system is in crisis. The laws of the system have inevitably led to such a level of concentration that profit accumulation has turned into its opposite. Technological innovation has permanently replaced a large section of labor in the US, creating the deindustrialized terrain Trump spoke so much about in his campaign. At the end of the day, the profits that Wall Street speculated into the ground ultimately came from the compulsion to increase buying power with large debt schemes that could never be paid back by a working class whose wages have been in decline for over three decades .
So when Hillary Clinton decided to campaign as some sort of united front against fascism, few listened. Many people in the US saw Clinton as an extension of the ruling establishment that had pummeled working class people into the ground. The Black Lives Matter movement exposed her complicity in the crime legislation that led to the vast expansion of the Black prisoner population during her husband's rule. Hillary Clinton then made the mistake of coalescing with the ruling establishments of both parties in hopes of isolating Trump when in fact she merely exposed her role as a loyal servant of power.
Some have claimed that since Clinton won the popular vote, she was the rightful winner regardless of her flaws. Others have argued that the Republican Party right-wing elites rigged the election . However true, there will be no recall this time around. Why? The DNC and the Clinton campaign rigged the primaries in order to defeat Sanders. In a stunning shift of political legitimacy, the Democratic Party has eviscerated all difference between itself and its Republican Party counterparts.
Numerous pieces have been written about the dangers of the cabinet Trump will select. Indeed, Trump‚Äôs possibilities do not deviate from the standard Republican Party makeup. His potential choices for top positions include ""tough on crime"" Rudy Giuliani, austerity magnate Chris Christie, and privatization enthusiast Newt Gingrich. However, for the first time in a long time, the President of the United States is accountable to something other than the ruling class. In the past, Republican Party and Democratic Party Presidents dutifully served its paymasters while using manipulation to ensure that their respective bases were effectively neutralized.
MORE... Defeating White Liberalism in the Age of Trump Brian Cloughley: ‚ÄúThe Greatest Achievement of Mr. Trump would be Engage in Positive Discussions with Russia and China‚Äù Arise President Trump (or Why it's not the End of the World as We Know it) This is not the case with Trump. Just a month ago, Trump was the least desired choice of the ruling class . It was Trump's petty bourgeois and working class base of white America that propelled him to victory. It is clear that the need to politically survive in hostile waters will compel Trump to choose a neo-con Administration. But a neo-con agenda is exactly what his supporters voted against. Even those who directly or indirectly ascribe to white American nationalism are sick of endless war and austerity. However, nothing less can be expected from the likes of Chris Christie and Newt Gingrich.
The contradictions of the Trump era will breed a social confrontation between classes not seen since the Great Depression. White liberals and white nationalists will battle for the soul of the two-party system. The neo-con establishment will have to confront Trump's foreign and economic policy campaign rhetoric, much of which is in direct antagonism with the GOP's record. And the Democratic Party will attempt to use the age of Trump as a time to regroup and steer the forces of resistance back into its camp.
How should the forces of resistance position themselves under this new set of conditions? First, the anti-war left needs to confront Trump's foreign policy head on and place pressure on him to make good on his promises to scale back NATO and its escalation toward Russia. The left needs to resist any and all attempts by Trump to make good on some of his less savory proposals, such as a the deportation of the million immigrants and the expansion of the US nuclear arsenal. Of course, Trump‚Äôs rhetoric must be placed in its proper context. It was the Obama Administration that signed a one trillion dollar agreement to ""modernize"" the US nuclear arsenal and deported nearly three million immigrants in eight years, a number unseen in US history. This means resistance to the Trump Administration's use of the apparatus that Obama and the Democrats built should be directed at the entire ruling class, not just one of the two parties that represent it.
The vast majority of people simply cannot afford the resurrection of the two-party system. As Don Debar of CPR News has made clear, the check of white supremacy simply doesn't pay the same dividends anymore. While the wealth gap between White America and Black American would take over two centuries to even out , it is also true that merely ten percent White America owns almost all wealth in the US . Capitalism's crisis has forced a large segment of the population to live under working class conditions. A unique opportunity exists to build and strengthen a radical left agenda in the US and a start a discussion of what it will take to implement it.
What is meant by ‚Äúopportunity‚Äù is that a narrow outlook on this moment will breed narrow results. It should be imperative that the left force Trump's hand on foreign policy. It should demand that Trump use his executive powers to force through a 21st century Glass-Steagall Act and create a federal jobs program to rebuild infrastructure in the US. The left should not hesitate to condemn and protest whatever white supremacist and repressive policies come out of his Administration, with full recognition that it was Democratic and Republican Party consensus that got us here. As emotions run high and fear captures a number of people completely disenchanted with the current political climate in the United States, the time has come to spend the time and effort necessary to prepare the people for the war that existed long before Trump: class war.",1
Crossing the Line in Democracy,"14 Shares

Democracy grants people the right to protest, to show their opinion on matters that affect their lives and their nation‚Äôs. Protesting is a universally acknowledged fact belonging to the modern world. It serves to give voice to those who are disturbed by the faulty policies, drawbacks and negligence of their governments and who wish to raise public awareness on these matters. Demonstrations, rallies, strikes, pickets, boycotts and so on are all ways of protesting. As long as they are within the limits defined by the ‚Äúlaw,‚Äù protests and acts of similar nature are in essence an indisputable part of democracy, freedom of opinion and expression.
However, in some cases protesting is exploited and used as a means of opposing democracy itself. Protests that give way to riots are now methods of staging coups to shut down administrations and overthrow democratically elected governments.
Legitimacy of Protests and Feasibility of Demands
Democratic protests are welcomed by societies and addressed by governments to the extent that their demands are tangible, justified and feasible . Protests lacking those qualities are most likely to fail in having their demands met.
The anti-government movement in Bulgaria in 2013-14 confirmed the validity of these qualities. The protests took place in three separate cycles. January and February witnessed rallies that objected to the high prices of electricity and demanded the government resign. They were successful as the requests were sensible. A later demonstration was against a government officer, and resulted in his resignation. Yet another cycle of protests called for a change of the system, along with some other illegal demands and faced defeat after turning into riots that were not supported by the overall society.
MORE... Gruesome Video Shows Turkish Soldiers Execute Female Kurdish PKK Fighters by Shooting in Their Heads 2 bombers, stopped by police, blew themselves up in Turkey Dispute over Kurds and Coup attempt threatens U.S.-Turkey alliance The attempted coup d‚Äô√©tat made Turkey band together The Gezi Park protests in Turkey in the same year followed the same pattern. Set in motion with a good willed and environmentalist approach, it was likely to succeed considering its solid and feasible calls and legitimate ways at first. The government heeded the nature lovers‚Äô voices and took a positive step by postponing a construction project that required the destruction of Gezi Park. Yet the humanist approach of young people changed course in the wake of provocations of separatist and terrorist gangs and turned into a totally different nature. Demonstrations that began in Gezi Park in Istanbul and that demanded the preservation of Gezi Park as a recreational area spread to other cities of the country and transformed into armed and bloody uprising imposing the fall of government. It was a quite clear coup d‚Äôetat attempt that did not refrain from using violent methods and openly rejected the validity of a democratically elected government. The protests were contradictory considering people took to streets using their democratic rights, but then appealed to non-democratic methods to lay their claims ignoring the will of the nation.
Though justified at the beginning, these two cases of protests demonstrate that they are open to hostile manipulations and may lose their legitimacy if left at the hands of ill-minded people. Recently some dark powers have been using this latest technique to manage countries‚Äô internal affairs as they see fit and stage coups to overthrow governments. They bring in professional teams of brutal killers amidst peaceful protests, which then lead to violent anti-democratic clashes. These protests sometimes end up in civil wars where fellows of the same nation kill one another. It all happens in the wake of a government‚Äôs non-yielding to some dark power‚Äôs demands and a democratically elected government faces anti-democratic attempts.
Methods of Provocations and OTPOR
Such dramatic outcomes come by the employment of social media. Social media becomes an instrument for organizing, stirring and agitating the masses that are presumed to join the demonstrations. Various provocative organizations undertake the organization of some agents and provocateurs who take part in demonstrations by inciting them to get violent. These illegal ‚Äúsubcontractors‚Äù organize the public relations part of the riots and channel intellectual circles of the country such as its authors, academicians, journalists and members of non-governmental institutions to act against democratically elected government in the name of democracy and to lead the public.
One of the most common groups among these ‚Äú professional revolutionary organizations ‚Äù is a Serbia-based resistance organization,OTPOR . Independent observers state that OTPOR organizes coup attempts and civil disturbance by providing training and logistic support for the US-backed dissident organizations in many countries such as the former Yugoslavia, Serbia, Georgia, Bulgaria, Ukraine, Egypt, Brazil, and Turkey. There is a consensus that the CIA has been creating riots and social disturbances in fifty countries OTPOR its offshoot CANVAS‚Ä¶
A relevant source puts forward the following interesting findings OTPOR :
The (OTPOR 's ) fist-logo, would turn up 11 years later in the streets of Cairo , illustrating further the preposterous, foreign-backed nature of the Egyptian uprisings... Serbia‚Äôs OTPOR would continue receiving funds from the West and become a ‚ÄúCIA-coup college‚Äù of sorts under the name of CANVAS (Center for Applied Non-Violent Action and Strategies ).
The research article penned by Carl Gibson and Steve Horn and published on ‚ÄúOccupy.com‚Äù deals with the international financial, intelligence and political connections of OTPOR and features the following information based on WikiLeaks documents:
Serbia‚Äôs Srdja Popovic is known by many as a leading architect of regime changes in Eastern Europe and elsewhere since the late-1990s , and as one of the co-founders of OTPOR‚Ä¶ Popovic and OTPOR's offshoot CANVAS have also maintained close ties with a Goldman Sachs executive and the private intelligence firm Stratfor as well as the U.S. government ‚Ä¶
Such examples are easy to find. The internal public opinion on OTPOR is that it is being employed as leverage to overthrow those governments which conflict with the interests of the U.S. No wonder some media organizations that act on behalf of the US administration speak highly of OTPOR at every turn. Moreover, the British media rigorously advocates that the executives of OTPOR have nothing to do with the organization of coups.
Likewise, some Turkish media organizations disseminated similar statements during the 2013 Gezi Park demonstrations. The attempt to occupy the Prime Minister‚Äôs residence by armed groups, which is an act of rebellion against the state and treason by law, was orchestrated by OTPOR, according to reports. Yet the media deliberately defined it as ‚Äúthe exercise of legitimate, democratic rights, and freedom of expression by the people,‚Äù and thus desired to create misapprehension to display the members of the Marxist and separatist terrorist organizations who are far from representing even a slightest portion of the nation as the representatives of the nation. These media organs called the nation‚Äôs security forces who risked their lives to preserve public order and people‚Äôs lives as ‚Äòthe so-called enemies of freedom and democracy.‚Äô
In truth, such mass demonstrations that aim to topple governments, divide countries and organize bloody conflicts - and even civil wars - can no longer be called innocent rallies, but subtle projects of deep states and shadow organizations to take over countries from within.",1

Army sources disclosed on Wednesday that pro-government troops are making final coordination for a massive offensive on Jeish al-Fatah terrorists in the Eastern parts of Aleppo city.
""As the army's 24-hour ultimatum to the terrorists to leave the city came to an end and as relative calm has prevailed over the Western and Southwestern parts of Aleppo, the army, the Lebanese Hezbollah fighters and special forces are getting ready to start attacking militants' defense line from several Eastern and Southern flanks,"" an army officer said.
Meantime, he appreciated the Russian help, saying, ""The Russian air and naval back up will speed up the Syrian army's advances in the operation.""
""Government forces are about to start their operation against the terrorists in Aleppo any moment,"" he added.
Local sources disclosed earlier on Wednesday that civilians in the Eastern districts of Aleppo city took to the streets to oppose Jeish al-Fatah's rule in the city, calling on the militants to leave Aleppo immediately.
""Unprecedented clashes between people and terrorists have pushed the Eastern neighborhoods of Aleppo city into a new wave of tensions,"" sources said, adding, ""People have taken part in demonstrations across the districts of Bostan al-Qasr and al-Kelaseh, calling on the terrorists to leave the city now.""
""People have also attacked terrorists' food stuff warehouses, fighting with the militants for looting their food stuff from their neighborhoods,"" the sources added.
The sources went on to say that terrorists have arrested a number of demonstrators, hitting them badly.
Civilians in militant-held districts of Aleppo are tired of terrorist groups' measures, including suppression of people and banning food and medicine for the families who prevent their young sons from joining the terrorist groups.
Meantime, Tens of fighter jets launched airstrikes on terrorists' positions in Aleppo on Tuesday to herald the long-awaited ground operations to capture the Eastern parts of the city.
Tens of warplanes started massive air assaults on enemy targets in the Eastern parts of Aleppo on Tuesday after three weeks of lull and as Russia's Admiral Kuznetsov aircraft carrier launched combat operations in Syria, the Arabic-language al-Mayadeen news channel reported.
The airstrikes started after several humanitarian pauses declared by the Syrian army and Russia to give a chance to the civilian population as well as the militants to leave the Eastern parts of the city through 8 corridors. Thousands of civilians left the city in the first few days, but militants blocked their exist paths, threatening to kill anyone who dares to approach the passages opened by the army. The terrorists aim to use the civilian population as a human shield.
The last such pause was declared on Monday when the army gave a 24-hour lone ultimatum to the Jeish al-Fatah coalition of terrorist groups to leave the flash point city. The deadline was not met by the militants, though.
Defense experts believe that the blitzkrieg is the first part of the long-awaited army operations in Eastern Aleppo to take back the entire city. Aleppo is halved into the government-ruled West and militant-held East. The militants rejected a guaranteed exit to relocate to Idlib or other militant-ruled territories in the hope that over 30,000 fresh forces would penetrate the city through the Southwestern front to lift the army's several-month-long siege on Eastern Aleppo.
Jeish al-Fatah lost thousands of militants in over two weeks of bloody war in Southern and Southwestern Aleppo, but failed to open a corridor for entrapped friends in the East.
The massive airstrikes in Aleppo come as Russia's Admiral Kuznetsov aircraft-carrying cruiser began combat operations in Syria.
Russian Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu announced earlier that Russian frigate Admiral Grigorovich launched missiles on terrorist targets in Syria.
""Today, we started a major operation to launch massive strikes on ISIL and al-Nusra Front (also known as Fatah al-Sham Front) targets in the Idlib and Homs provinces in Syria,"" Shoigu said at a meeting with the ministry‚Äôs leadership and defense enterprises.
""For the first time in history of Russian Navy, Admiral Kuznetsov aircraft-carrying cruiser has begun military operations,"" Shoigu said.
Russian naval task force in Syria is reliably protected by Bastion Coastal Defense Missile Systems and Pantsir systems, the minister said.

""Our forces, including very well trained units, are deployed in nine different fronts and are waiting for the specified deadline,"" the command center said in a statement.
Other informed sources disclosed that the Syrian army has prepared a large number of forces, who are expert in street battle and are equipped with lethal weapons, ready to start final the battle with the terrorist groups.

Right at the heart of Iraq, surrounded by the Terror of the Black Flag Army it is communities of men which will gather in prayers, and in mourning to perform the last rites of Imam Hussain ibn Ali, the grandson of the Prophet Muhammad.
While Arbaeen has eclipsed even the Hajj in terms of attendance, few ‚Ä¶ even within Islam have ever heard of the pilgrimage, let alone the tragedy it recalls, never mind the principles it saw enacted.
Arbaeen it needs to be said stands very much an offense to Wahhabism - this dogma the House of Saud has furiously promoted to assert its ascent to power. Arbaeen it needs to be emphasised, actually speaks of this eternal struggle in between Good and Evil, Freedom and Slavery, Piety and Dogmatism.
 Sidelined by mainstream media for it speaks of Islam‚Äôs attachment and commitment to such values as Justice, Freedom and Compassion towards all men, and all fashion of faiths, Arbaeen has nevertheless towered a beacon of hope amid the furious rise of radicalism. Arbaeen I would personally argue, has become a grand symbol of resistance against oppression ‚Äì the coming together of communities beyond their differences, and most importantly perhaps in spite of their differences, so that together they could oppose tyranny and offer the oppressed a rampart behind which to find refuge.
For those of you who still have no idea what in the world I am talking about, allow me to tell you the story of a man - a man whose courage, resolute strength of character and yearning for Truth have echoed across the centuries to inspire generations upon generations to think themselves free, and to rise themselves independent from the yoke of tyranny.
MORE... Messenger 40 ‚Äì Muslims Develop Technology to Promote Religious Unity against Radicalism Why Muslims Hold the Biggest Human Gathering under the Threat of ISIS in Iraq? The 10th Day‚Äôs new campaign ‚Äì community-building and social solidarity Shia Muslims gather in DC for anti-terror rally Imam Hussain ibn Ali‚Äôs martyrdom in the plain of Karbala over a millennium ago stands testimony to our collective struggle against injustice. And though it is Islam‚Äôs banner the Third Imam carried, his message was a universal call for freedom ‚Äì an immovable promise that real tragedy lies not in our failure to defeat tyrants but in our reluctance to oppose them.
Allow me to take you back a few centuries, back when Islam‚Äôs early History was still being written, back when the name of the Prophet Muhammad was still murmured in the present tense through the lips of his progeny: the House (AhlulBayt).
Only a few decades after Islam‚Äôs last prophet‚Äôs passed, Islam stood divided as a nation-state, its religious sovereignty challenged by men of greed and oppression: Yazid ibn Muawiyah was one of them ‚Ä¶ arguably the most barbaric of them all since he envisioned slaughter to be the legacy of his throne.
As bigots brandished Islam to rationalise their heresy, and proclaim righteous exceptionalism before the abomination of their deeds, Imam Hussain had no other choice but to march against Yazid ‚Ä¶ even if alone, for as long as there was breath in him, it is Justice he would command for all people.
And so the Imam marched on ‚Ä¶ from the holy city of Mecca to the then-deserted plain of Karbala he walked knowing death would be his fate. And still he pushed on ‚Ä¶
It is this determination to meet Evil and not relent in the task which Arbaeen speaks of most loudly. It is allegiance, loyalty and love, pilgrims manifest into reality as they walk towards their Imam, united not faith but in their humanity.
Arbaeen you most likely were never told is NOT exclusive to Islam. Arbaeen is neither Shia nor Sunni, Arbaeen is for all who dare think themselves free under God and in Him seek refuge.
And while Arbaeen has long been associated to Shia Islam for its school of thought revolve around those very principles Imam Hussain consecrated with his death, the pilgrimage stands not in opposition or rejection of any faith ‚Äì quite the contrary since Christians, Yezidis, Hussainis Brahims, alongside countless other religious denominations have year after year, centuries after centuries come to Karbala to remember.
Arbaeen is remembrance of Hussain ibn Ali, remembrance of the Word of God made complete through Hussain, the man the Prophet Muhammad called his son, and whose leadership he commanded all believers to forever follow.
If many failed in their allegiance for fear rendered them motionless before their Imam‚Äôs calls, Hussain‚Äôs station in Karbala has echoed ever since of a love so brilliant and unparalleled that all people, all nations, all faiths, across time and space have found themselves compelled to walk the great walk of Arbaeen ‚Ä¶ and through Hussain ibn Ali find their humanity.
Arbaeen I have to say speaks to the best of our humanity; it is home after all to the best of humanity - martyr among all martyrs, there has never been a day like Hussain‚Äôs day - and though his name Wahhabism has worked to bury under the rubbles of History, Karbala has remembered its Imam with fierce loyalty.
A city build around and for Hussain ibn Ali, Karbala is a declaration of allegiance to the House of the prophet - those extraordinary men and women whose hearts, lips and prayers have spoken Islam in wisdom and piety, and without whom we would be orphans.
Every year without fail Karbala has fervently commemorated its Imam - even in oppression, especially when in oppression.
Before the poison of radicalism, Karbala has offered generosity and compassion, before brutal repression Karbala has opened its doors and to all oppressed offered a shelter, before the depravity of sectarianism Karbala‚Äôs pulpits have called upon men and women to hold to rope of Allah, never to disunite.
A city surrounded by the evil of Daesh Karbala has never shun brighter.
In the face of insane fanaticism Imam Hussain‚Äôs followers have never been braver.
And so coming this November 20-21, 2016 Karbala will let out a roar which will shook tyrants‚Äô thrones. Karbala will offer all of its prayers and all of its devotion ‚Ä¶ Hussain‚Äôs name will be etched on believers‚Äô hearts, tears of allegiance will flow, fists will rise to the sky, a promise that when called upon all will answer.
Islam today is best manifested in Karbala since Karbala shuns no one. Karbala today has put Saudi Arabia to shame since it has provided food and shelter to tens of millions of pilgrims - without expectation, without any hope of a thank you.
A city has proven more generous and compassionate in its destitution than Saudi Arabia in its wealth and might. Where the so-called custodians of Islam have cried the weight of the Hajj on their coffers, Karbala has provided beyond the mathematically feasible.
In a few short days Karbala will stop time once more ‚Ä¶ so that all could remember all martyrs are in fact alive and that the sons of Hussain are still standing vigil.",1

Ansar Bayt al-Maqdis ‚Äì ISIS-affiliated extremist group in Egypt ‚Äì has released images purporting to show the execution of a 100-year-old man.
The group, who rebranded as ISIS-Sinai when they pledged allegiance to the extremist group holding swathes of Iraq and Syria, killed Sheikh Sulaiman Abu Haraz after kidnapping him earlier.
The ISIS-affiliate in Egypt mistakenly described in a statement as priests, but were later identified by locals as leading religious figures from among Sinai's Bedouins.
Pictures were posted on the Twitter accounts of the group's supporters. They showed one of the men, elderly with a white beard and kneeling in an orange jumpsuit with his neck pressed against a steel stand. Masked ISIS executioners dressed in black raised long swords over his head.
Locals identified the man as the blind Sufi sheikh Suleiman Abu Heraz, who was abducted two weeks ago from his farm south of the peninsula's town of el-Arish. The second man was identified as sheikh Said Abdel-Fattah, a top Religious Endowment cleric abducted a month ago.

"Mark Zuckerberg, Don't Get Hoodwinked by Media and Politicians","3 Shares

Shortly after Hillary Clinton's crushing defeat, the media came up with another spin: Zuckerberg and Facebook were held responsible for her debacle! What crap! Facebook apparently carried ""fake news"". Didn't the media invent and promote precisely this kind of ""news"" to bounce Hillary over the last hurdle? It's convenient for media whores to blame everybody except themselves and Hillary's corrupt campaign organization for her defeat. Clinton labeled ordinary Americans ""deplorables"", displaying her contempt for half of the population. Hillary Clinton was favorite puppet of the Establishment. She was the embodiment of a hopelessly corrupt political system. And the American people realized it despite massive attempts by media presstitutes to sell her image. An estimated 95 per cent of media outlets beat the drums for her and for her husband's corrupt Clinton Foundation.
The real reason behind the attempt to blame Zuckerberg's Facebook is, that it makes everyone (and no one) responsible. What is posted on Facebook can no longer be controlled by the media and the political class. They lost control of public opinion. Established methods of mind-control do not work any longer. The fawning media report only what they are fed by government spin-doctors. It is more comfortable for them to act like the mouthpieces of their masters. This holds true for US media, as well of the media class in the European vassal states. German media were, for example, as manipulative as those in the United States. They celebrated President Obama as the embodiment of ""good America"", ignoring that he waged wars during his entire presidency, incarcerated several whistleblowers and signed off extra-legal executions. But he possessed a great advantage, he was black, or if you wish, non-white. Obama was thus a non-white and smarter version of George W. Bush.
When Mark Zuckerberg visited Berlin in February 2016, he was bootlicked by the German political and media class. The Springer group, the most outspoken mouthpiece of U.S. interests US in Germany, awarded him the Axel Springer Award. Of greater political relevance was the dinner meeting between Zuckerberg and Chancellor Angela Merkel who tried to convince him to apply himself with more determination against so-called hate-speech on the internet. The Merkel regime considers that freedom of speech hurts her policy. Merkel‚Äôs minister of justice, Heiko Maas, has established some sort of a private internet police that hunts the web for ""hate speech"", whatever that means.
There is no agreed upon definition what ""hate speech"" implies, hence the meaning can be volatile or arbitrarily. The range of ""Hate speech"" can range from anti-Muslim rhetoric via personal insults and threats to a call ""to kill every Jewish Zionist"". There is a duty of government under the ""International Convention for the Abolition of All Forms of Racial Discrimination"", to prohibit the dissemination of racial propaganda. Ergo, there exists a legal and ethical basis for prohibiting certain forms of ""hate speech"".
Even restrictions to ‚Äúfree speech‚Äù extend to other spheres, such as prohibition of deceitful advertising, slandering other people, and in some countries advertising tobacco and alcohol is forbidden in Iceland. Human rights law accepts the right of governments to restrict freedom of speech in order to protect other social values. There is a great deal of jurisprudence regarding the question who to weigh this right against other rights.
In Germany, this body of private detectives includes civil society groups such as ""klicksafe.de, ""jugendschutz.net"", ""Gesicht zeigen"" (Show your Face), to name a few. The most eminent of these is the Amadeu Antonio Foundation, run by a former Stasi agent by the name of Anetta Kahane, who claims to fight racism, anti-Semitism, and xenophobia. Today, she and her organization are at the forefront of criticizing people who dare to criticize the excesses of Merkel's policy of government failure.
Internet giants such as Facebook, Google (and YouTube) and Twitter also participated ""voluntarily"" in this constitutive meeting in which this kind of internet watchdog was set up. In September 2015, this new ""censorship body"" was established in the German Ministry of Justice and works since then without legal basis! The participants agreed on ""best practices"" in handling hate messages. There are no publically known criteria according to which one can recognize ""hate speach"". That means that this censorship body makes it decisions arbitrarily. There are no rules or statutory provisions. Those whose messages are blocked have thus no legal recourse against such censorship. Despite such arbitrary practice, the interim results, which were presented in the Ministry of Justice on 27 September 2016 were not satisfactory. Google (and YouTube) and Facebook representatives participated in the presentation of the results. From August to September, 622 punishable contents were reported that were deleted by the companies. Nevertheless, the Ministry of Justice was not satisfied.
Thus, it is not only the American political class which is blaming Facebook for the defeat of its minion Hillary Clinton but also the German political class and its compliant media that intend to crack down on Facebook, fearing that ordinary people could endanger Merkel's quest for a renewed mandate as Chancellor. But what appears more important is their desperate attempt to control public opinion because the ""deplorables"", i.e. the mass of ordinary people, do not anymore wish to be bamboozled by half a dozen editors-in-chief. The attempt to free themselves from such control has to be crushed with the help of Facebook and Google.
At the beginning, Zuckerberg rejected the ridiculous accusations of being responsible for Clinton's defeat. After a while, it appears that he has accepted to do the dirty work for the censors and caved in. On Friday, November 18, 2016, Zuckerberg wrote on Facebook that the amount of ""misinformation is relatively small"", nonetheless there is ""much work ahead on our roadmap"". The following work in progress was outlined by him:
""A stronger detection system. The most important thing we can do is to improve our ability to classify misinformation. This means better technical systems to detect what people will flag as false before they do it themselves.
- Easy reporting. Making it much easier for people to report stories as fake will help us catch more misinformation faster.
- Third party verification. There are many respected fact checking organizations and, while we have reached out to some, we plan to learn from many more.
- Warnings. We are exploring labeling stories that have been flagged as false by third parties or our community, and showing warnings when people read or share them.
- Related articles quality. We are raising the bar for stories that appear in related articles under links in News Feed.
- Disrupting fake news economics. A lot of misinformation is driven by financially motivated spam. We're looking into disrupting the economics with ads policies like the one we announced earlier this week, and better ad farm detection.
- Listening. We will continue to work with journalists and others in the news industry to get their input, in particular, to better understand their fact checking systems and learn from them.""
Apparently, Zuckerberg understands the importance of the issue. I beg to differ. The issue is not about fake news, it is about universal freedom of speech that poses a threat to the mind-control industry, owned by a few families on both sides of the Atlantic Ocean. If they lose this control of public opinion, they rightly fear to lose in the long run their privileges.
Dear Mr. Zuckerberg, take courage, and do not interfere with ordinary folks speaking their minds despite the pressure and intimidation by the political and media class.
When one discusses freedom of expression and the role of Facebook one point needs special scrutiny, namely the private character of this entity. The private character of an entity precludes transparency. Citizens and users do not possess any rights to inspect the finances, let alone participate in determining Facebook projects and policies. As a citizen, one cannot accept that one unelected person, however, nice he may be, could determine the projects and policies of an entity that is now serving billions of human beings. Such a structure just cries for corruption and arbitrary rule. One can see this operating within Wikipedia where doctrinaires exert control over subjects of social science such as the circumstances of 9/11 or the Israel/Palestinian conflict. It's impossible to even insert critical question because they don't pass the censorship of certain guardians of mind control. Google is another such Leviathan that cries for public and transparent ownership. How such public ownership of a global corporation is to be accomplished is a question that begs for an answer. The first step would certainly be for civil society, without influence from the corporate world, to get together and consider a more democratic and transparent structure for such global services. It would be wise for civil society to get going before corporations will establish fake democratic forums to preempt this goal.",1
University of Lethbridge Is an Indicator that Canada Is on a Downwards Spiral: Interview with Prof. Anthony Hall,"If academic freedom is not to be respected in institutions of supposedly higher learning then there can be no basis for freedom of speech in environments not subject to the protections of tenure.

Dr. Anthony J.Hall is a Professor of Globalization Studies at the in Alberta Canada. Professor Hall is the editor-in-chief of the American Herald Tribune. He is author of several books, including a two-volume publishing project at McGill-Queen‚Äôs University Press entitled ‚ÄúThe Bowl with One Spoon‚Äù; American Empire and the Fourth World: The Bowl with One Spoon, Part I (McGill-Queen‚Äôs Native and Northern) Earth into Property: Colonization, Decolonization, and Capitalism: The Bowl with One Spoon, Part II (Mcgill-Queen‚Äôs Native and Northern Series). The Part II edition was recently selected by The UK Independent as one of the best books of 2010. The Journal of the American Library Association called Earth into Property, ‚ÄúA scholarly tour de force.‚Äù The books aim to set the 9/11 catastrophe and post 9/11 Wars in the context of global history, since 1492. Dr. Hall has been suspended and harshly pulled from his classroom, in mid-term without any process of arbitration: namely, for having expressed his viewpoints on Israeli crimes, calling for an open debate on the Holocaust and 9/11, despite being promoted to a Full Professor rank through a process of peer review. In an exclusive interview with Khamenei.ir Professor Hall elaborates on how academic freedom is perceived and practiced in the West:
Ayatollah Khamenei has stated that ‚Äúgenuine freedom of thought will help the country to progress. In the absence of a free intellectual atmosphere, there can be no opportunity for growth.‚Äù How do you‚Äì as a Professor‚Äì perceive it?
I reflected very self-consciously on the prospects of contributing to the progress of my country Canada when I opted in the mid to late 1970s to go to graduate school at the University of Toronto. With the great Canadian historian, J.M.S. Careless, as my Ph.D. Supervisor I made a commitment to study the history of colonial relations with the First Nations of Canada. My course of study took me in 1982 to my first appointment in the Native Studies Department at the University of Sudbury. The University of Sudbury was in those years a Jesuit-run entity. It formed the institutional seed from which the secular Laurentian University would emerge in the decades prior to my appointment there.
For the next two decades I was able to work from my academic bases in Sudbury and then in Lethbridge Alberta beginning in 1990. At the invitation of the Leroy Little Bear, the Chair of the Department of Native American Studies I thus moved to the resource-rich province of Alberta. Once again I was motivated to make the transition in my professional work with the hope my I could contribute constructively to the progress of our country from an academic base in Western Canada.
In my years as a young professor I took an active part in four First Nations/First Ministers conferences that took place in Ottawa between 1983 and 1987. The purpose of these conferences was to negotiate a constitutional amendment to give greater definition to the phrase, ‚Äú the existing Aboriginal and treaty rights of the Aboriginal peoples of Canada are hereby recognized and affirmed.‚Äù (Section 35, Constitution Act, 1982) .
MORE... The B'nai Brith and the History of the Mounting Assault on Academic Freedom in Canadian Universities Creating an Anti-Muslim Bias at a Canadian University Suspension of Tenured Professor Lacks Due Diligence Toxic Mind Control Contaminates The Public Sphere Section 35 was part of the text of the instrument facilitating the movement of authority over Canada‚Äôs constitutional structure from the British imperial Mother Country to the domestic institutions of Canadian federalism.
The culmination of my contributions to the formulation of a made-in-Canada version of the Canadian constitution involved my opposition between 1987 and 1990 to what became known as the Meech Lake accord. If this political deal between Canada‚Äôs First Ministers had become constitutional law, the First Nations of Canada would have been excluded from a very powerful legal definition of Canada‚Äôs ‚Äúfundamental characteristic.‚Äù
In academic essays, in the mainstream media and in presentations to various legislative committees, I contributed to public awareness of the negative implications of the Meech Lake accord for fair-minded Canadians supportive of existing Aboriginal and treaty rights. More specifically I contributed to the strength of the platform from which an Oji-Cree parliamentarian by the name of Elijah Harper used his veto power in the Manitoba Legislature to block the ratification of the Meech Lake accord. Because of Elijah Harper‚Äôs actions the Meech Lake accord did not become part of Canada‚Äôs ‚Äúsupreme law.‚Äù
I was able to contribute to discourse crucial to the progress of Canada until about the year 2000. Between 2000 and 2002 I had to adjust my work away from the activities of the Department of Native American Studies towards a field of my own making, Globalization Studies. I prepared two academic volumes to lay the academic foundation and methodological framework for my transition to a new academic role. The core focus of my emphasis on ‚ÄúGlobalization Studies‚Äù was Indigenous peoples in encounter with colonialism globally from 1492 until the present.
It is in this context and with the encouragement of my very accomplished student, Joshua Blakeney, that I began to shift focus towards the treatment of Palestinian and other Arab peoples in the region of Greater Israel, Eretz Israel. It was Joshua who also led me to my first interactions with Iranian journalists resulting in my participation in the New Horizon conference of the autumn of 2014. As I have described in writing elsewhere this episode proved to make a major positive impact on me.
Due to the intervention of my colleague, the Mohawk activist Splitting The Sky, I also began to see the events of 9/11 as a major factor in the shaping of the global geopolitics in the twenty-first century.
My quest for new academic turf at the has sometimes been bumpy and contested. Certainly many major obstacles were put in the way of my promotion to full professor. Eventually my academic peers were allowed to make their input into the promotion process apart from the artificial blockages thrown up by my University administration. In 2008 after what I took to be my obtaining a position of intellectual and professional security as a senior faculty member, I resolved that henceforth I would pursue difficult lines of research and publication. I made this decision with an understanding that less secure younger colleagues might eschew such a course of action.
I have made no secret of the fact that I see the recent surrender of the high ground of academic freedom by the members of the administration of the as an indicator that Canada is on a downwards spiral. It seems to me there is a move a foot to sabotage the intellectual freedom of our universities. If academic freedom is not to be respected in institutions of supposedly higher learning, then there can be no basis for freedom of speech in environments not subject to the protections of tenure.
The first to suffer the crackdown in universities will be our students. They will have to deal with the fact that the treatment visited on me indicates it has become dangerous to ask pointed questions which might produce answers embarrassing to power. Our country, Canada, cannot progress to higher levels of discourse and achievement under these repressive conditions.
Ayatollah Khamenei believes ‚Äúexchanging viewpoints and opinions are in the nature of academic work‚Äù; How is this principle practiced at Lethbridge University?
I agree that exchanging viewpoints and opinions is a central aspect of academic work within universities and between universities. I found that there was a good deal of openness to the exchange of information and ideas with colleagues, media and public officials in the years between 1982 and 2001 when the core of my academic work revolved around the history of Canada-First Nations relations.
Unfortunately I would have to say that the obstacles to the exchange of information and ideas began to mount significantly after 2008 when I began to question the official narrative of what happened on 9/11. Who really did what to whom during the initiating events of what soon became known as the Global War on Terror? As I began to become skeptical of the official narrative I noticed more and more inclination on the part of colleagues to distance themselves from the subjects that captured my professional interest. To put it bluntly, I suppose it became clear to me that, for a number of reasons, it was not a good career move for younger colleagues to show interest in the subject of 9/11 specifically and false flag terrorism more generally.
As I began to look more deeply into the existing research on 9/11 I was simultaneously drawn to the subject of war crimes and international law. My collaboration with Splitting The Sky became more intense when we went to work to organize in response to the decision of the former US President, George W. Bush, to give a talk in Calgary in 2009 as his first public engagement as (theoretically) a regular civilian citizen. Our collective action in Calgary in the spring of 2009 led to a trial that we dubbed Splitting The Sky versus George W. Bush . Although I had not yet associated the lies and crimes of 9/11 with Israel First protagonists, I ran into my first Zionist pushback for my 9/11 studies when I presented my essay, ‚ÄúShould George W. Bush Be Arrested in Calgary, Alberta, To Be Tried For International Crimes?‚Äù I originally presented the paper at an invited talk at the University of Winnipeg.
My essay eventually ended up as an exhibit in the litigation that we referred to as Splitting The Sky versus George W. Bush . Our stance was that the former US President should have been arrested in Canada for being a credibly-accused war criminal. We were far from alone in bringing forward evidence that Bush had violated many international covenants and conventions against, for instance, prohibited torture. Not only had he arguably violated international law but it seemed the former US President had violated Canada‚Äôs own Crimes Against Humanity and War Crimes Act . The legislation had passed through Parliament with the view that Canada should not become a haven for war criminals.
In pursuing this line of analysis I faced my first allegations that somehow my academic inquiry was anti-Semitic.
As I worked on this subject, one that I integrated into my pedagogy, it became clear to me that we have never seen anything but victor‚Äôs justice when it comes to the enforcement of international law against those that commit war crimes, crimes against humanity, crimes against the peace and crimes against democracy. It seems that only those on the losing side of military conflicts are ever brought to justice. Those on the ‚Äúwinning‚Äù side, the stronger side, are invariably held to be above the law.
This line of scholarly investigation did result in various channels of academic exchange opening up for me with colleagues in my own university and other universities. The most fruitful collaboration to develop, however, was that with Dr. Kevin Barrett who had lost his academic position at the University of Wisconsin for incorporating 9/11-related subjects into his research and pedagogy.
For sure I should not be made to feel so alone in the academy when it comes to the study of 9/11, the most transformative event of the twenty-first century. In my view the academic institutions in North America and Europe have failed abysmally in the study of false flag terrorism starting with the events of 9/11. I am particularly appalled by how this failure on the part of our institutions of higher learning has contributed to the rise of Islamophobia as the necessary psychological condition giving license to those promoting the invasions of Muslim-majority countries.
In a meeting with President Rouhani and his Cabinet, the Leader of the Islamic Revolution said: ‚ÄúWhen it comes to caricatures insulting the sanctities of Islam, the West suddenly becomes an advocates of freedom and the freedom of expression. However, when it comes to the Holocaust, there is no freedom of expression!‚Äù Why do you think we witness such double standards?
A gross display of double standards plagues the ethnocentric way ‚Äúfreedom‚Äù is being defined in the so-called ‚ÄúWest.‚Äù The psychological operations attending the ‚ÄúWe Are Charlie Hebdo‚Äù ceremonies on Paris in early 2015 epitomized the hypocrisy. The whole essence of this strange event in the city of Lights seemed to signal that ‚Äúfreedom of speech and expression‚Äù in the West is virtually limitless when it comes to demeaning through cartoons of Prophet Mohammed as well as other sacred symbols of Islamic religion. The other side of the same coin are the many prohibitions imposed on, for instance, the French comedian M‚Äôbala M‚Äôbala Dieudonn√©. Dieudonn√© was barred from entering Canada for his efforts to make humor of the paranoid state of affairs attending any public references to Jews, Jewish institutions or the activities of Israel these days.
One of my discoveries through this period of crisis is the fact that the thought police agents in the B‚Äônai Brith equate my call for open debate on ‚Äúthe holocaust,‚Äù and indeed open debate on all subjects, as the equivalent of so-called ‚Äúholocaust denial.‚Äù How many of my colleagues at the and in other universities have bent before the harsh intimidation? How many have made themselves proponents of shutting down open debate and allowing censorship from outside the academy to regulate our research, teaching and publication?
There is a controversial Quote: from Ayatollah Khamenei in which he says‚Äô ‚ÄúMay God curse all those who put an end to political thoughts, work and endeavor in universities‚Äù. What‚Äôs your take on that? How essential do you think such a perspective is for the academia?
I agree wholeheartedly with the Supreme Leader‚Äôs observation. One of the great gifts of the Creator to humans is the gift of reason and rationality. Our application of reason and rationality to our understanding of society will inevitably contribute to political thought, work and endeavor.
This type of applied reason should be especially vital in the work of universities where the highest level of political conception should be able to find expression, elaboration, and receptiveness. Indeed we need to make ourselves expert in Universities at making safe places for the development of political discourse. God curse us in the universities if we cannot be the home for vibrant political discourse.",1

Monday marked the final day of the mourning for Imam Hussein who was martyred in a battle with the massive army of Yazid after refusing allegiance to the tyrant caliph. Yazid the caliph of Umayyad dynasty was promoting the same type of Islam as ISIS and Wahhabist preach today.
Millions of marchers participated in the annual Arbaeen Procession in Karbala. The marchers are said to come from over 60 countries, and most of them have marched all the way to Karbala from other Iraqi cities like Najaf and Baghdad in a show of devotion. Each year, Sunni Muslims and followers of other religious groups such as Christians join the journey to mourn the martyrdom of Imam Hussein.
Arbaeen, or mourning, is a Shia Muslim tradition to mark the anniversary of seventh-century social justice leader Imam Husain. Arbaeen is commemorated 40 days after Ashura, the martyrdom anniversary of Imam Hussein (AS) and his companions in 680 AD. However, in light of ISIS terror attacks globally, several people took the controversial step of turning their march political in order to denounce terror in all forms.
Tens of thousands of Muslims have been killed and displaced by ISIS‚Äôs declared caliphate, an exponentially larger number than those killed in attacks in the West.

The 10th Day‚Äôs new campaign ‚Äì community-building and social solidarity The occasion has found additional significance in recent years as it has become a rallying cry for the campaign against ISIS terrorists who have frequently targeted the pilgrims.
Iraqi troops have been deployed to ensure security for the pilgrims. The northern and western parts of Iraq have been plagued by gruesome violence ever since ISIS terrorists began a campaign of terror in the country in June 2014.
The terrorist campaign, however, has not dissuaded pilgrims from around the world from making the journey.
It is noteworthy to mention the mainstream media blackout of the millions people marched gathering in war torn Iraq, battling the ISIS, as a clear sign of biased reporting.",1

Mohsen Abdelmoumen : According to you, when we see the numerous demonstrations anti-Trump in the United States after the election of Donald Trump at the presidency, are we witnessing a colored revolution?
Wayne Madsen: It is classic Soros-funded color revolution. Soros is financing MoveOn.org, Black Lives Matter, Demos, and other of his groups to turn out protesters and is even running ads in papers looking for paid drivers and protest coordinators.
In your very relevant books devoted to George Soros: ‚ÄúSoros: Quantum of Chaos‚Äù, you reveal the true face of this figure who is the spearhead of several destabilization operations in the world. From where does all the power come that this criminal holds and why is he untouchable?
Soros is very wealthy and actually a frontman for an even more powerful and wealthy person, Evelyn de Rothschild, along with his family. They are all the true puppet masters of the world.
Soros remains a major element in the anti-Trump device. Can Trump resist him?
MORE... Disrespecting the American Imperial Presidency Trump Won, Now What? Will America Survive the Next 4 Years? Defeating White Liberalism in the Age of Trump Trump is actually now being surrounded by people who will serve in his administration who will be loyal to the Soros-Rothschild puppet masters and certainly not to Trump.
Can we say that the occult world is more powerful than legal institutions?
Secret societies with their crazy rituals have been the bane of human existence since the time of the Sanhedrin and Pharisees in Palestine and the Dionysian cults of the Nile Valley and the Mediterranean region.
In your book ‚Äú ISIS is US - The Shocking Truth Behind the Army of Terror‚Äù, you detail the relations between the USA and ISIS/Daesh. What is the triggering element that has put you on this trail?
Trump's national security adviser retired Lt Gen Michael Flynn revealed that the US was supporting ISIS and then he was forced to resign. My own sources in the Middle East confirmed this long before Flynn made his public statement and was fired as Defense Intelligence Agency chief by Obama.
You mention Western Sahara and the involvement of the Clintons in a deal with the Kingdom of Morocco while this case is under the authority of UN. Aren't the Clintons outlaws such Bonnie and Clyde by supporting Morocco against the Sahrawi people and the UN's resolutions?
The Clintons received at least $12 million from the Moroccan government in return for buying their loyalty to Morocco's agenda, which includes permanently annexing Western Sahara as the ""Southern Province."" Morocco and Israel share the same policy on annexing illegally-occupied territories.
According to your diverse very interesting analysis, can we assert that the World Government or the false prophets of the New World Order are the real decision-makers of this world?
I mentioned a few already, Soros/Rothschild. Others are the Bilderbergs, Bohemian Club, and the Council on Foreign Relations and their counterparts.
You know very well some American intelligence agencies like the NSA. Do these intelligence agencies serve the US' interests or, rather, the oligarchy's interests?
The CIA has always served the interests of Wall Street. NSA now serves the interests of the global security network it leads.
You were an officer in the US Navy. Was the whistleblower you are today born after your military career or before?
Before. I was an FBI-Navy whistleblower in 1982 and helped to uncover a major pedophile ring in the US Navy that reached into the Reagan-Bush White House and was ultimately exposed in The Washington Times in 1988-89. My whistleblowing cost me my Navy career, however, and a subsequent series of fairly bad jobs.
In the recent US election, we saw the mass media bankruptcy despite their manipulations and their fake polls. Didn't one of the pillars of world oligarchy collapse under our eyes? Don't we witness a historic moment announcing the end of the New World Order and its purely capitalist product, globalization?
99 percent of major newspapers endorsed Clinton. Many alternative news sources supported Trump. We are seeing a massive shift away from newspapers and corporate TV and websites to the alternative media, of which WayneMadsenReport.com has been prominent since its founding in 2005.
Snowden has denounced the Prism program and you have denounced Echelon, both of which serve the interests of the world's oligarchic caste. What is known is not only the immersed part of the iceberg?
What is still relatively unknown is the close cooperation between NSA and private companies like Microsoft, Apple, Google, Facebook, and major telecommunications companies. It is much greater than even Snowden's documents describe.
The quantity and especially the quality of your reports reveal to us a world unknown by millions of human beings. How all these truths have been hidden?
The major media cooperates with the government in covering up news events.
I advise everyone to read the Wayne Madsen Report as well as your books and follow your various interventions in the alternative media. How do you explain that we, who are resisting to what I call the fascist oligarchic caste, are called conspiracy theorists? Is this concept the only weapon of the fascist imperialists to reduce to silence all those who resist them and to reinforce the ranks of those whose who have been brainwashed?
The term conspiracy theorist was developed by the CIA in the mid-1960s to ridicule those who believed there was a wide government role in the assassination of President Kennedy. It has been used ever since to describe legitimate researchers into Iran-Contra, 9/11, and other deep state crimes.
Your book ‚Äú The Star and The Sword ‚Äù is one of the few to talk about intimate and opaque links between the Zionist entity of Israel and Saudi Arabia. You claim that they organize false flag attacks, including the 9/11. What is the origin and nature of this Israeli-Saudi strategic alliance? Do you think that the JASTA law will succeed or will it be countered by the Zionist allies of Saudi Arabia? Do the fact that the USA and the Westerners turn a blind eye on the criminal war led by the Saudis to Yemen isn't due to the weight of the lobby Zionist?
The Zionist-Wahhabi/Saudi alliance goes back to Ibn Saud who wrote the British and Zionist leaders that he did not oppose a Jewish homeland in Palestine so long as it did not lay claim to Saudi territory on the eastern shore of the Gulf of Aqaba. The relationship has always been close, except for the time of King Faisal, who was conveniently shot in the face and killed by a relative.
Do you undergo pressure or threats in relation to the remarkable work you do? If so, how do you live it?
I was forced to move my domicile from Washington because the outgoing Obama administration put pressure on some media organizations I did work for. These included RT (contributor agreement canceled) and Al Jazeera America (which is now defunct).
The FBI entered my apartment in Washington at least twice and I've had three visits by them at my new home in Florida.
I was informed of 3 personal threats in Washington.
I ignore all these pressures and continue to exercise the freedom of the press.
Are you optimistic or do you think that the Satanist project of the oligarchy still has a nuisance capacity that can plunge the world into chaos?
As with cockroaches, which detest light, the shadow figures of covert power cannot stand what is known as the disinfectant of sunshine. Light has always fought against darkness and will continue to do so.

Disrespecting the American Imperial Presidency,"2 Shares

(Credit: IoSonoUnaFotoCamera / flickr)
When the dust settled on the Nov. 8 election, we learned that a completely unpredictable, egomaniacal, narcissistic buffoon would inherit the White House and the vast powers that go along with it. This deeply offended many people who see Donald Trump‚Äôs racist and misogynistic rhetoric as ‚Äúunpresidential.‚Äù Liberal New York Times columnist Charles Blow summed up this view: ‚ÄúI respect the presidency; I do not respect this president-elect.‚Äù That the president-elect should not be respected is a given. But why should we respect the presidency?
The Imperial Presidency of the United States has evolved over the last century to the point that the executive holds certain powers that can be considered dictatorial. Arguably, the most consequential decision in politics is to wage war. The Constitution specifically reserves this right for Congress. The President, as Commander-in-Chief, directs the wars that Congress declares. However, starting with Truman‚Äôs intervention in the Korean War in 1950 and continuing with invasions of Vietnam, Grenada, Iraq and Afghanistan and the bombings of dozens more countries, the President‚Äôs ability to unilaterally initiate war with a sovereign nation has been normalized. Congress has not declared war since 1941 despite the fact the U.S. military has intervened in nearly every corner of the world.
In recent years, George W. Bush assumed the power to kidnap, torture, and assassinate any individual, anywhere in the world, at any time, without even a pretense of due process. Upon replacing Bush, Barack Obama legitimized Bush‚Äôs kidnapping and torture (by refusing to prosecute the perpetrators or provide recourse to the victims) while enthusiastically embracing the power to assassinate at will. Noam Chomsky said Obama has trashed the 800-year-old Magna Carta, which King John of England would have approved of.
Can there be anything more dictatorial than the power of a single individual to kill and make war at will? While American presidents thankfully do not have the power to unilaterally impose taxes, pass legislation, or incarcerate without charges inside U.S. borders, the illegitimate authority they do possess to carry out unrestrained violence across the world is unquestionably one feature of a dictator.
There has not been a single American president since World War II that has not exceeded his constitutional authority by committing crimes that would meet the standard by which officials were convicted and executed at the Nuremberg trials.
Roosevelt‚Äôs Executive Order 9066 to imprison Japanese Americans in concentration camps was a flagrant violation of the Fifth Amendment right not to be deprived of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law.
MORE... Wayne Madsen: The CIA Has Always Served the Interests of Wall Street Trump Won, Now What? Will America Survive the Next 4 Years? Defeating White Liberalism in the Age of Trump Truman‚Äôs firebombing of Tokyo, nuclear bombing of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, and invasion of Korea violated provisions of multiple treaties that are considered the ‚Äúsupreme law of the land‚Äù per Article VI of the U.S. Constitution.
Eisenhower‚Äôs use of the CIA to overthrow democratically elected presidents in Iran and Guatemala, as well as the initiation of a terrorist campaign against Cuba, violated the UN Charter, another international treaty that the Constitution regards as the supreme law of the land.
Kennedy was guilty of approving the creation of a mercenary army to invade Cuba, as well as covert warfare in Vietnam. Johnson massively escalated U.S. military involvement in Vietnam with the introduction of ground troops, which he fraudulently justified to the public through misrepresentation of the Gulf of Tonkin incident.
Succeeding Johnson, Nixon waged a nearly genocidal air campaign against not only Vietnam but Cambodia and Laos, killing hundreds of thousands of people, destroying ecosystems across Indochina, and leaving an unfathomable amount of unexploded ordnance , which continues to kill and maim hundreds of people each year.
Ford covertly supported the South African invasion of Angola and overtly supported the Indonesian invasion of East Timor. Carter continued support of the Indonesian occupation of East Timor, as well as providing military support to military dictatorships in Guatemala and El Salvador. Reagan oversaw the creation and operation of a terrorist army in Nicaragua, sponsored military dictatorships throughout Central America, and directly invaded Grenada.
Bush the Elder invaded Panama and Iraq. Clinton oversaw sanctions in Iraq that killed as many as 1 million people, carried out an air war from 15,000 feet against Serbia, and bombed a pharmaceutical plant in Sudan that produced medications for half the country. Bush the Lesser invaded and occupied Afghanistan and Iraq. Obama continued both of those wars, as well as dramatically expanding the drone assassination program in as many as seven countries.
So I beg to differ with Blow and anyone else who claims the presidency deserves respect. Any institution or position that permits such illegal and immoral actions unchecked should be eradicated and replaced with some alternative that does not allow such concentration of power in the hands of a single person.
Liberal Clinton defender Matt Yglesias argues that from a historical perspective, Trump is uniquely dangerous. ‚Äú(P)ast presidents,‚Äù Yglesias writes, ‚Äúhave simply been restrained by restraint . By a belief that there are certain things one simply cannot try or do.‚Äù
It is hard to take such vacuous proclamations with a straight face. As we have seen, every single American president since at least WWII has engaged in serious violations of international and domestic law to cause death, destruction and misery across the world, from murdering individuals without due process to unleashing two nuclear bombs on civilian populations in a defeated country that was seeking to surrender.
When Trump assumes the presidency, he will inherit a frightening surveillance/military/incarceration apparatus that includes a targeted killing program; a vast NSA domestic and international spying network; a death squad (the Joint Special Operations Command); and an extralegal system for indefinite kidnapping and imprisonment at Guantanamo Bay.
Partisans see a problem only when the presidency is in the ‚Äúwrong‚Äù hands. If Obama is at the helm, liberals are fine with unconstitutional mass surveillance or killing an American citizen without charge or trial every now and then. Conservatives trusted Bush to warrantlessly surveill Americans, but were outraged at the Snowden revelations.
Principled opponents recognize that no one should be trusted with illegitimate authority. The hand-wringing and hyperventilation by liberals about the dangers of a Trump presidency ring hollow and hypocritical.
American presidents long ago became the equivalent of elected monarchs, beyond the democratic control of the those they purportedly serve. The occupant of the office is able to substitute his own judgments and whims for a universally applicable set of laws and limits on the exercise of power. It is what Dolores Vek describes as ‚Äúactually existing fascism.‚Äù Both parties have contributed to it, the media has normalized it, and the public has accepted its creation and continued existence without rebelling against it. It‚Äôs time to stop treating the presidency itself with respect and start actively delegitimizing it.",1

According to Rai al-Youm newspaper , a Bedouin Jordanian poet has expressed his willingness to marry the daughter of Donald Trump , the US president-elect.
Falih Al-Jabour wrote in a poem that Jordanian officials are on their way to the white house to ask for the hand of Tiffany Trump, the president‚Äôs youngest daughter. He hoped the offer wouldn‚Äôt be turned down.
Al-Jabour proposed to Tiffany in his strange and humorous poem and even offered to pay a substantial price for the bride including 50 camels, 200 thoroughbred horses and a 15.5-acre field.
This Jordanian poet published his poem in social networks and asked the bride‚Äôs family not to reject him.
Falih Al-Jabour‚Äôs only condition for the marriage is that after marrying him and going to his home land, the bride has to wear burka, because she‚Äôs ‚Äúso beautiful‚Äù, otherwise there will be a chaos in the tribe.

"Egypt Says No to Saudi, Drafts Generals and Pilots to Fight Alongside Syrian Army against ISIS","November 24 ,2016 BY AHT Staff Egypt Says No to Saudi, Drafts Generals and Pilots to Fight Alongside Syrian Army against ISIS Syria Finds New Partner in Fight against ISIS. 44 Shares 1 
‚ÄúThe small jump needed for Egyptian-Syrian relations to go back to normal‚Äù that Syrian Prime Minister Walid al-Muallem spoke of has been achieved apparently. Mohammad Ballout, from Assafir Lebanese Daily , reported that some Egyptian military formations have recently arrived to Syria, signaling an end to the time where Egypt simply stood by, hands crossed, looking at the goings-on in Syria. 
It seems that the Egyptians have sent 18 helicopter pilots to the Hamah Airbase, and it is hoped that they will see action in joint Egyptian-Syrian operations. 
Four senior Egyptian military figures also joined the unit when it first came to Syria, and two Major Generals have been operating at the Armed Forces Staff Headquarters in Damascus, near the operations room. The two Major Generals have been touring the fronts since they arrived a month ago, and have been reviewing the efforts made at the fronts, most recently the Southern Front at Quneitra. 
These new developments are apparently the result of intensive, unannounced, high profile security meetings that began over a year ago between Cairo and Damascus. Arab sources also expect that these developments will go beyond these symbolic operations, and will see Egyptian task forces operating on a large scale in support of the Syrian army. 
Moreover, a senior Syrian security official also said that the Egyptians have promised to send forces to Syria, and have schedule post-December 23rd as the Zero-Hour, whereupon Egyptian participation in Syria will escalate. Another official also revealed that after December, a large number of Egyptian forces will also participate in the Syrian operations, and their participation will not be limited to Aerial support.

By Susan Duclos - All News PipeLine Progressive liberals, George Soros and his merry band of paid protesters, and the mainstream media are certainly giving new meaning to William Shakespeare's "" Fight to the last gasp ,"" quote, but what none of them seem to realize yet as they cry, scream, riot and offer their mea culpa's is that the fight is over, the election is finished, their opponents have gone home to celebrate and they are doing nothing but flailing in the wind while grunting incoherently.While anyone can see the headlines about the third day of protests and riots, and how those that are incapable of understanding quite how elections work and are holding out for a pipe-dream that maybe they can make electors of the electoral college change their vote, what many are missing is how the mainstream media is attempting to suck more air out oxygen tanks that have gone empty.... and they have no one to blame but themselves. THE ULTIMATE LOSERS IN THE 2016 ELECTION - THE MSM For the last year and a half we have witnessed and reported on the mainstream media's unrelenting and unapologetic campaign against Donald Trump, where 91 percent of the reporting since the party's convention, where he was named the GOP nominee, has been studied and found to have been negative, but even before that they treated Trump as if he didn't stand a chance to win that nomination.We have noted and reported via Wikileaks releases how that very same MSM had colluded with the DNC and the Clinton campaign in order to influence the public to elect Hillary Clinton.We have also observed and reported how Trump supporters were constantly labeled and portrayed as racist, sexist, xenophobic, Islamophobic, uneducated, uninformed, white nationalist deplorables, just to name a few of the colorful descriptors.How did that work out for them?Despite their biased reporting and throwing everything, including the kitchen sink, at Trump, we now have President-Elect Donald Trump headed for the White House, to be sworn in on January 20, 2017. While Hillary Clinton will fade into obscurity and the protesters will eventually go home just to criticize everything Trump does for the next four (maybe 8?) years, and progressives will get over their sworn ""revolution"" within the party between liberals and moderate Democrats, the ultimate losers are not Clinton supporters, celebrities that swore to leave the country if Trump won, nor Democrats as a party.... it is the mainstream media that was rendered irrelevant, crushed by a wave of ""deplorables"" and alternative media bypassing their once-influential status to communicate without their fasle prism of 'truth.' MSM'S LAST GASP Now they are offering their mea culpas, dedicating countless hours and ink to explaining and justifying how they were so wrong in their predictions that they knew ahead of time were based on a false premise, and taking their ""last gasp"" by swearing to ""rededicate"" themselves to reporting honestly, while at the same time claiming they reported on ""both candidates fairly.""I kid you not.Below is a letter by Arthur O. Sulzberger Jr. and Dean Baquet, the publisher and editor of the New York Times:First point is that if they had been reporting ""fairly"" as claimed in the letter above, they would not need to ""rededicate"" themselves to honesty. Secondly, they did not strive ""to understand and reflect all political perspectives and life experiences,"" of Trump supporters, rather they maligned, criticized, belittled and mocked anybody that did not agree with their superior and smug political opinion.While it is to be expected that Trump supporters, verbally abused on a regular basis will not forget nor forgive media outlets such as the Times, the Public Editor Liz Spayd, who works independently, with the job of examining The Times with an eye to protecting journalistic integrity and good practices, describes the reaction from other members of the public to their reporting. Readers are sending letters of complaint at a rapid rate. Here¬ís one that summed up the feelings succinctly, from Kathleen Casey of Houston: ""Now, that the world has been upended and you are all, to a person, in a state of surprise and shock, you may want to consider whether you should change your focus from telling the reader what and how to think, and instead devote yourselves to finding out what the reader (and nonreaders) actually think."" Another letter, from Nick Crawford of Plymouth, Mich., made a similar point. ""Perhaps the election result would not be such a surprise if your reporting had acknowledged what ordinary Americans care about, rather than pushing the limited agenda of your editors,"" he wrote. ""Please come down from your New York City skyscraper and join the rest of us."" What Ms. Spayd does not acknowledge is that their reporting will not and cannot change as long as their publisher and editor, the ones that wrote the letter in the image above, continue to insist their reporting during the campaign season was in any way fair, or to even pretend they attempted to ""understand and reflect all political perspectives."" What Ms. Spayd also does not address is the fact that five different New York Times' reporters accepted the invitations for the off-the-record gatherings to ""frame the HRC message"" with the Clinton campaign staff before her campaign launched, including, Gail Collins, Jonathan Martin, Maggie Haberman, Patrick Healy, and Amy Chozick, all of which consistently penned hit pieces against Trump.It is heartening to see that outlets like the New York Times are being called to the carpet by their own readers, as well as admitting they are losing subscribers, because while Trump supporters were maligned and lied about, their readers were misinformed and lied to . The country¬ís major news organizations, as surprised as anybody by Donald J. Trump¬ís ascension to the presidency, faced a question from their audiences on Wednesday that was laced with a sense of betrayal and anger: How did you get it so wrong? The question came in letters. (""To editors and writers of The NYT,"" one reader wrote, ""you were so wrong for so long. You misled your readers and were blinded by your own journalistic bigotry."") It came in Facebook posts. (""You were in a bubble and weren¬ít paying attention to your fellow Americans,"" the filmmaker Michael Moore wrote in a post shared more than 100,000 times.) Most ominously, it came in the form of canceled subscriptions, something that will surely be monitored. Former Times' reporter Michael Goodwin offers the Times some free advice : Using an outside law firm or even in-house reporters, he must assess how and why Baquet made the decision to sever the paper from its roots. He must assess the impact on reporters and editors, and whether they felt pressure to conform their stories to Baquet¬ís political bias. Whatever the findings, the publisher must insist that the standards of fairness again become a fundamental tenet in the news room. As an added guarantee, he must insist that the paper enlarge its thinking about diversity to include journalists who disagree with the Times embedded liberal slant. There has to be a difference of perspective to judge where fairness lies. Readers, and former readers, should be part of the process. Many already know that the paper must get its head out of parochial New York and into the hearts and minds of Americans everywhere. This is about survival. If it doesn¬ít change now, the Gray Lady¬ís days surely are numbered. BOTTOM LINE Frankly I believe traditional media's days are numbered whatever they do, and they are on their last gasp. There are too many Independent journalists and alternative news sites from both sides of the political aisle that are rendering them irrelevant. While alternative media has its own set of biases, the majority always provide links, documents when available, video clips and other methods for readers to verify, research and come to their own conclusions, something mainstream media doesn't want readers to do because they feel they have the right to lead the public where the MSM wants them to go, rather than inform the public and trust them to make their own determinations.",1
WIKILEAKS: Hillary Staffers Were Happy About Killing of Black Teen to Advance Gun Control ‚ÄúThis is Great‚Äù ‚Äì American Lookout,"
From BizPac Review: 
Newly released emails from Wikileaks show Hillary Clinton staffers debating how they can best use the death of a black man to further their agenda. 
The email began as a request for an essay by Clinton from Marie Claire who was partnering with Harvard University on a study about women and guns but it quickly devolved into brainstorming ideas on how to push the campaign‚Äôs anti-gun and racial narratives. 
The team began discussing an article published in ‚ÄúThe Guardian‚Äù where the mother of Jordan Davis, a black teenager murdered by a white man for playing music loud, called the killing a ‚Äúlegal lynching‚Äù despite the fact that the murderer, Michael David Dunn, was convicted and sentenced to life in prison. 
De‚ÄôAra Balenger, the director of engagement for ‚ÄúHillary for America‚Äù could hardly contain her excitement. 
‚ÄúThis is great,‚Äù she wrote. ‚ÄúThe only flag here is that Jordan Davis was killed by a white man, so arguably ‚Äì this crime was racially motivated, which takes this outside the discussion of gun violence.

WHAT? Some Cities Are Now Pushing For Noncitizen Immigrants TO VOTE ‚Äì American Lookout,"WHAT? Some Cities Are Now Pushing For Noncitizen Immigrants TO VOTE shares 
Every time Donald Trump suggests the election could be rigged in some way, Democrats and their many media allies scoff and laugh, then accuse Trump of promoting conspiracy theories. 
At the same time, the left is trying to steal the election in broad daylight. 
Bloomberg reports: 
Some Cities Want Their Noncitizen Immigrants to Vote 
‚ÄúLook at illegal immigrants voting all over the country,‚Äù Donald Trump recently claimed in a Fox News interview, part of his ongoing effort to cast doubt on the integrity of the presidential election. There‚Äôs no evidence to support the Republican nominee‚Äôs claims of election fraud, but some cities are moving to expand voting rights to include noncitizens. 
The latest is San Francisco, where the Nov. 8 ballot will include a measure allowing the parents or legal guardians of any student in the city‚Äôs public schools to vote in school board elections. The right would be extended to those with green cards, visas, or no documentation at all. ‚ÄúOne out of three kids in the San Francisco unified school system has a parent who is an immigrant, who is disenfranchised and doesn‚Äôt have a voice,‚Äù says San Francisco Assemblyman David Chiu, the son of Taiwanese immigrants. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôve had legal immigrants who‚Äôve had children go through the entire K-12 system without having a say.‚Äù Undocumented immigrants should also have the right, Chiu adds, to bypass the ‚Äúbroken immigration system in this country.‚Äù 
Noncitizen voting isn‚Äôt as radical as it might sound. For more than half of U.S. history, from 1776 until the 1920s, noncitizens were widely permitted to participate in elections. ‚ÄúWe had 40 states that used to allow it,‚Äù says Ron Hayduk, an associate professor of political science at San Francisco State University. ‚ÄúImmigrants could vote, not just in local elections,‚Äù he says. ‚ÄúThey could even run for office‚Äîand did win office.‚Äù The hope, Hayduk says, was that immigrants would feel more invested in civic life if they were able to participate in American democracy. 
Do you think Democrats would want non-citizens to vote if they tended to vote Republican? 
Of course not. 
The Democrat party is a criminal enterprise and they‚Äôll do whatever they have to do to win. shares ",1

In these final days of the election the gloves have truly come off. Trump has just released a new ad which ties Hillary‚Äôs email scandal and the new FBI investigation to Anthony Weiner, the husband of Hillary aide Huma Abedin. 
The Washington Examiner reports: 
New Trump ad targets ‚Äòpervert‚Äô Anthony Weiner, dubs Clinton ‚Äòunfit to serve‚Äô 
Donald Trump‚Äôs campaign has capitalized on the latest developments surrounding Hillary Clinton‚Äôs private email server, releasing a new television ad on Thursday that ties the Democratic presidential hopeful directly to disgraced ex-Congressman Anthony Weiner. 
Weiner, the estranged husband of top Clinton aide Huma Abedin, came back to haunt Democrats last week after FBI officials uncovered more than 650,000 new emails on a device of his, some of which may have originated from Clinton‚Äôs unsecured server. The discovery led FBI Director James Comey to reopen the agency‚Äôs investigation into Clinton‚Äôs handling of classified material. 
‚ÄúHillary Clinton is under FBI investigation again after her emails were found on pervert Anthony Weiner‚Äôs laptop,‚Äù says the narrator of the 30-second ad, which the Trump campaign titled ‚ÄúUnfit.‚Äù

BREAKING: Wikileaks Reveals Hillary‚Äôs Campaign Chair Engages In SATANIC RITUALS,"
Sean Brown AMERICA‚ÄôS FREEDOM FIGHTERS ‚Äì 
Wikileaks has revealed some rather troubling things about Hillary Clinton and her staffers, but perhaps the most disturbing, a bizarre, is the fact that John Podesta is involved with satanic rituals. 
No, this isn‚Äôt fiction and I‚Äôm not wearing tin foil on my head. An email released by Wikileaks reveals Podesta was invited to a ‚Äúspirit cooking dinner‚Äù by performance artist Marina Abramovic, and you can rest assured that it‚Äôs not anything like it sounds. 
‚ÄúI am so looking forward to the Spirit Cooking dinner at my place. Do you think you will be able to let me know if your brother is joining? All my love, Marina,‚Äù an email dated June 28, 2015 read. 
Shortly after, the emails, which was sent to Podesta‚Äôs brother Tony, was forwarded to john with the message, ‚ÄúAre you in NYC Thursday July 9 Marina wants you to come to dinner.‚Äù 
Now you‚Äôre probably wondering what all the fuss is about, and I seriously can‚Äôt blame you. So let‚Äôs turn to Paul Joseph Watson from InfoWars for a little background on what this ‚Äúspirit cooking‚Äù is really all about. 
Spirit cooking refers to ‚Äúa sacrament in the religion of Thelema which was founded by Aleister Crowley‚Äù and involves an occult performance during which menstrual blood, breast milk, urine and sperm are used to create a ‚Äúpainting‚Äù. 
According to Marina Abramovic, if the ritual is performed in an art gallery, it is merely art, but if the ritual is performed privately, then it represents an intimate spiritual ceremony. 
The video embedded above depicts the bizarre nature of the ceremony. Abramovic mixes together thickly congealed blood as the ‚Äúrecipe‚Äù for the ‚Äúpainting,‚Äù which is comprised of the words, ‚ÄúWith a sharp knife cut deeply into the middle finger of your left hand eat the pain.‚Äù 
The ceremony is, ‚Äúmeant to symbolize the union between the microcosm, Man, and the macrocosm, the Divine, which is a representation of one of the prime maxims in Hermeticism ‚ÄúAs Above, So Below.‚Äù 
Below is a video of Abramovic conducting the satanic ritual:

BREAKING: Trump Just Gave Obama HORRIBLE News... Check Out What The Pentagon JUST Did,"
Dean James AMERICA‚ÄôS FREEDOM FIGHTERS ‚Äì 
Last week, the Pentagon issued a Defense Department directive that allows ‚ÄúDepartment of Defense (D0D) personnel to carry firearms and employ deadly force while performing official duties.‚Äù 
The Defense Department has been working on changing the ‚Äúgun-free‚Äù zones on domestic military basis for several years in light of the deadly shootings at military sites in recent years. 
Military.com reports that the directive ‚Äúalso provides detailed guidance to the services for permitting soldiers, sailors, airmen, Marines and Coast Guard personnel to carry privately owned firearms on DoD property.‚Äù It authorizes ‚Äúcommanders, 05 and above‚Ä¶[to] grant permission to DoD personnel requesting to carry a privately owned firearm (concealed or open carry) on DoD property for a personal protection purpose not related to performance of an official duty or status.‚Äù 
The directive also makes clear that DoD will consider further changes to grant ‚Äú[standard] authorizations for other DoD personnel, who are trained in the scaled use of force or who have been previously qualified to use a government-issued firearm, to carry a firearm in the performance of official duties on DoD property.‚Äù This would allow DoD with certain combat training to carry firearms without going through the additional step of making application with a commander. 
Kim Smith at Conservative Tribune notes that the policy was a response to an NRA-backed provision in the 2015 National Defense Authorization Act that required the Defense Department to allow more service members to carry firearms on base. 
‚ÄúIt is a good first step in that it recognizes personal protection is a valid issue for service members, but there are many roadblocks in the way of making that option available,‚Äù NRA spokeswoman Jennifer Baker told the Washington Free Beacon . 
Those wishing to apply for permission to carry a firearm must be at least 21 years old and meet all federal, state and local laws, the directive said. 
It would appear that the Pentagon saw no problems with implementing a policy for which President-elect Donald Trump has expressed support. 
President-elect Donald Trump ran on removing gun-free zones from military bases. On July 9, 2015, Breitbart News reported that Trump pledged to end the gun-free scenarios for U.S. troops by ‚Äú[mandating] that soldiers remain armed and on alert at our military bases.‚Äù 
The immediate institution of this directive probably left President Barack Obama incensed, but he undoubtedly realized that there was nothing he could do to prevent its implementation in a couple of months anyway. And that‚Äôs good news because it works to ensure the safety of our troops, which should always be a priority.

Blacks and Liberals Want to Abolish Science,"Posted on October 26, 2016 Blacks and Liberals Want to Abolish Science Dan Roodt, American Renaissance, October 26, 2016 The South African ‚Äúfallist‚Äù movement finds another target. 
On my recent visit to Stockholm for the Identitarian Conference, some Swedes and I compared notes on whose country was the most crazy-liberal and anti-white. The Swedes pointed to a short video recently released by an NGO that said Swedes should ‚Äúintegrate‚Äù into the culture of third-world immigrants to form a ‚Äúnew country.‚Äù 
My Swedish colleagues agreed with French author Renaud Camus. Writing on Free West Media , he argues that, whereas white populations everywhere seem determined to be replaced by third-worlders, ‚Äúthe case of Sweden is even more tragic, more extreme, more insane. Nowhere else do a people and a nation show a stronger will to suicide.‚Äù 
But I believe South Africa is worse. We have actual laws, regulations and policies that require corporations, universities and sports bodies to replace whites. Our country has become the world champion of anti-white, anti-Western ideology. Together with our northern neighbor Zimbabwe, we are to multiculturalism what Pol Pot‚Äôs short-lived Democratic Kampuchea was to communism: its most extreme expression. Pol Pot waged genocide against the entire middle class of Cambodia in order to start a ‚Äúnew society.‚Äù 
South Africa‚Äôs ruling elite also wants a ‚Äúnew society‚Äù that will be cleansed of Western influences and even the white race. As Robert Mugabe put it during his famous 2015 visit to Soweto: ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt want to see a white face.‚Äù 
The current upheavals at our universities‚Äìknown absurdly as the ‚Äúfallist movement‚Äù‚Äìhave been widely reported. Enraged black students, egged on by ‚Äúunderstanding‚Äù whites, have demanded that one thing after another must ‚Äúfall,‚Äù each accompanied by its own hashtag. First it was #RhodesMustFall (the statue of Cecil Rhodes at the University of Cape Town), then #AfrikaansMustFall (blacks want to eliminate Afrikaans as a language of university instruction), followed by #FeesMustFall (they want tuition fees abolished) and now, #ScienceMustFall. 
In a video that has had nearly a million views, a female black student at the University of Cape Town called for science to be scrapped, saying: 
If I personally were committed to decolonization, science as a whole is a product of Western modernity and the whole thing should be scratched off. So if you want practical solutions to how to decolonize science, we have to restart science from‚ÄìI don‚Äôt know‚Äìfrom an African perspective, from our perspective, from how we‚Äôve experienced science. For instance, I have a question for all the science people: There is a place in KZN called Umhlab‚Äôuyalingana. They believe that through the magic, the black magic‚Äìyou call it black magic, they call it witchcraft‚Äìyou are able to send lightening to strike someone. Can you explain that scientifically because it‚Äôs something that happens? 
The initial reaction was widespread ridicule from ordinary whites, but I knew that her dismissal of Western science was not taking place in a vacuum and was connected with the cultural-Marxist ideas swirling through most Western universities. After all, Herbert Marcuse, one of the founders of cultural Marxism wrote this in ‚ÄúAn Essay on Liberation‚Äù in 1969, at the height of US student radicalism: 
This is the Hippie subculture: ‚Äòtrip,‚Äô‚Äògrass,‚Äô‚Äòpot,‚Äô‚Äòacid,‚Äô and so on. But a far more subversive universe of discourse announces itself in the language of black militants. Here is a systematic linguistic rebellion, which smashes the ideological context in which the words are employed and defined, and places them into the opposite context‚Äìnegation of the established one. Thus, the blacks ‚Äòtake over‚Äô some of the most sublime and sublimated concepts of Western civilization, desublimate and redefine them. (p. 35) 
Needless to say, Marcuse approved of the black ‚Äútake over,‚Äù and if he were alive today, he would surely applaud what is happening in South Africa. Not only are blacks taking over Western concepts and changing them into their opposites, they are taking over our institutions as well. 
In universities and the mainstream media there was actually praising this young ‚Äúfallist.‚Äù I was only slightly surprised to read a piece in Afrikaans entitled, ‚Äú #ScienceMustFall nie so belaglik soos dit mag klink ‚Äù (#ScienceMustFall not so ridiculous as it sounds). It was written by Liezel de Lange, the managing director of our Sunday newspaper Rapport , which once supported apartheid and segregation. 
Miss De Lange first confessed ignorance because she attended the University of Pretoria in the days when it still taught Western ideas and culture. She laments that when she studied English literature ‚Äúalmost all our prescribed works were from Britain (and Ireland), as well as the USA. I have to give my lecturers at the time credit for assigning readings from Wole Soyinka, Chinua Achebe and Ngugi wa Thiong‚Äôo.‚Äù Most Westerners no doubt have deficient educations because they have not been taught Ngugi wa Thiong‚Äôo. 
Although Liezel de Lange did not exactly endorse the science-must-fall idea, in defense of the young fallist she evoked the mythical ‚Äúmedieval African university‚Äù of Timbuktu as evidence that Africa‚Äôs vast contributions to world learning are being ignored. In fact, Timbuktu was a center for Islamic and Tuareg schools, not a hub of forgotten African or black science. Nor are Africans themselves united in wanting to preserve what is left of the ‚Äúmedieval African university.‚Äù Recent Al Qaeda activity in the region has been so destructive that the New Yorker recently ran a story called ‚Äú Has the Great Library of Timbuktu Been Lost? ‚Äù 
I asked Liezel de Lange on Twitter whether she was an Afrocentrist, but she evaded the question, answering that she merely ‚Äúposits that not all knowledge, wisdom and insight come from the West.‚Äù It‚Äôs hard to disagree with that. 
Miss De Lange‚Äôs column was just a watered-down version of a more radical piece she had read on the left-wing website The Daily Maverick by Joel Modiri, called ‚Äú In the Fall: Decolonisation and the rejuvenation of the academic project in South Africa .‚Äù 
Mr. Modiri is a black academic at UNISA (University of South Africa), which has been racially ‚Äútransformed‚Äù‚Äìmeaning that whites have been all but banished. It is Africa‚Äôs largest correspondence university, naturally founded by South African whites. Mr. Modiri explained that ‚Äúher [the fallists] error proves her point.‚Äù He decried: 
the presentation of knowledge by South African universities as predominantly the product of the West, and the failure to recognize that some of the major scientific disciplines (medicine, physics, astronomy, mathematics, among others) have deep heritages in Africa, China and India . . . . 
In other words, she is a victim of the false, Eurocentric view that science is Western to begin with. Some American blacks have long maintained that the West stole its knowledge from Africa. They never explain how science could be ‚Äústolen‚Äù from one people by another, leaving no trace behind. Knowledge is not like the Mona Lisa, which cannot exist in more than one place, so it is strange that the wise Africans who conceived of science and culture no longer possessed it once it was ‚Äústolen‚Äù from them. 
But we have to remember Samuel Huntington‚Äôs dictum in his book The Clash of Civilizations and the Remaking of World Order : ‚Äúculture follows power.‚Äù If anything, this is what the rest of the world might learn from South Africa: Whoever dominates politically will impose his culture and beliefs, even if they are more primitive than those it replaces. Once the scientist has been politically and culturally subjugated he may have to bow down to the witchdoctor. 
Unfortunately, it is not only pseudo-intellectual blacks such as Mr. Modiri who hate the West. One of the most Europhobic statements in support of the black UCT student came from Stuart Theobald, a white-liberal English South African academic who ‚Äúdivides his time between London and Johannesburg.‚Äù 
In the same Rapport that Liezel de Lange edits, Mr. Theobald writes of the need to ‚Äúdecolonize‚Äù science because ‚Äúit has been used to justify racism‚Äù and to support ‚Äúbiological racism.‚Äù He continues: 
We are kidding ourselves if we pretend that colonial attitudes are not still affecting the way science works today. This is why a deliberate effort to decolonise science is valuable and South African universities have the opportunity to lead the charge. 
He adds that we need a new paradigm in science ‚Äúthat recognises the racism embedded in much of scientific practice and methodology,‚Äù and that ‚Äúa postcolonial science‚Äù that is ‚Äúshorn of the straitjacket of past thinking‚Äù will solve problems that now baffle us. He notes the ‚Äúfuss‚Äù made over the fallist student‚Äôs comments and then asks: ‚ÄúBut when you see the entanglement of racism and science, can you blame her?‚Äù 
Are South African blacks and white liberals ready to ditch science in favor of the ‚Äúdark arts‚Äù as Harry Potter would say? If they have tooth aches or appendicitis, I suspect they will submit to the humiliation of ‚Äúcolonial science‚Äù rather than look for a cure in the traditional rituals and voodoo of Africa.",1
A Lot of People in the US Are Suddenly Identifying as ‚ÄúWhite‚Äù,"A Lot of People in the US Are Suddenly Identifying as ‚ÄúWhite‚Äù Eric D. Knowles and Linda R. Tropp, Quartz, October 25, 2016 
Many political commentators credit Donald Trump‚Äôs rise to white voters‚Äô antipathy toward racial and ethnic minorities. However, we believe this focus on racial resentment obscures another important aspect of racial thinking. 
In a study of white Americans‚Äô attitudes and candidate preferences, we found that Trump‚Äôs success reflects the rise of ‚Äúwhite identity politics‚Äù‚Äìan attempt to protect the collective interests of white voters via the ballot box. Whereas racial prejudice refers to animosity toward other racial groups, white identity reflects a sense of connection to fellow white Americans. 
We‚Äôre not the first to tie Trump‚Äôs candidacy to white identity politics . But our data provide some of the clearest evidence that ongoing demographic changes in the United States are increasing white racial identity. White identity, in turn, is pushing white Americans to support Trump. 
White identity 
When we talk about white identity, we‚Äôre not referring to the alt-right fringe, the white nationalist movement, or others who espouse racist beliefs. Rather, we‚Äôre talking about everyday white Americans who, perhaps for the first time, are racially conscious. 
{snip} 
Non-Hispanic whites are projected to become a minority in the year 2044. This increasing diversity across the country is making whites‚Äô own race harder and harder to ignore. {snip} 
Trump and white identity politics 
As whites increasingly sense that their status in society is falling , white racial identity is becoming politicized. Trump‚Äôs promise to ‚Äúmake America great again‚Äù speaks to these anxieties by recalling a past in which white people dominated every aspect of politics and society. {snip} 
{snip} 
To test our ideas about Trump and white identity politics, we surveyed a nationally representative sample of about 1,700 white Americans. The survey covered racial identities, attitudes, and political preferences. In examining the relationship between white identity and ethnic diversity, we chose to focus on an ethnic minority of particular salience in contemporary politics: Hispanics. {snip} 
Do whites from heavily Hispanic neighborhoods show stronger white racial identity? To measure identity, we used a widely-used questionnaire . On a five-point scale, participants rated their agreement with items such as ‚ÄúBeing a white person is an important part of how I see myself‚Äù and ‚ÄúI feel solidarity with other white people.‚Äù As shown in the graph below, there is a positive relationship between exposure to Hispanics and white respondents‚Äô sense of racial identity. 
And does white identity lead to support for Donald Trump? We examined the relationship between white identity and respondents‚Äô likelihood of supporting Trump for the presidency versus Hillary Clinton or several Republican primary challengers. Consistent with others‚Äô analyses , white identity strongly predicts a preference for Trump. 
Whites at the high end of the racial identity scale are more than four times as likely to support Trump than those at the low end of the scale. Perhaps that‚Äôs because whites highest in racial identity are also the ones most likely to harbor negative attitudes against Latinos. Indeed, we found white identity was significantly correlated with another characteristic‚Äìprejudice. 
However, differences in prejudice don‚Äôt explain the relationship between white identity and Trump support. The pattern in the figure above was tested while statistically controlling for levels of anti-Hispanic prejudice. Because the relationship between identity and support for Trump remains strong, we are confident that white identity independently predicts greater Trump support. 
We‚Äôve seen that living close to Hispanics leads whites to develop a strong sense of racial identity and that strong racial identity is associated with support for Donald Trump. We should therefore expect that whites in heavily Hispanic neighborhoods support Trump more often than those in neighborhoods with fewer Hispanics. This prediction gains credence from work by political scientist Ryan Enos, who finds that everyday exposure to Latinos can increase support for restrictive immigration policies. 
Whites‚Äô support for Donald Trump is, in fact, greatest in areas with a large Hispanic population.

Moms in the United States illegally gave birth to 275,000 babies in 2014, enough birthright U.S. citizens to fill a city the size of Orlando, Florida, according to an analysis of data from the National Center for Health Statistics. 
The data showed that newborns to illegals accounted for 7 percent of all births in 2014, according to the analysis from the Pew Research Center. 
{snip} 
The analysis also found that the growth in the birthrate of America is entirely driven by immigrants. 
‚ÄúWhile the annual number of babies born in the U.S. has fluctuated in recent years‚Äìmost markedly during the Great Recession when there was a significant drop in births nationwide‚Äìthe trajectory over the past four decades or so has been upward. In 2014, there were 4 million births in the U.S., compared with 3.74 million in 1970,‚Äù said Pew. 
‚ÄúThis growth has been driven entirely by the increasing numbers of babies born to immigrant women. In 2014, immigrant women accounted for about 901,000 U.S. births, which marked a threefold increase from 1970 when immigrant women accounted for about 274,000 births. Meanwhile, the annual number of births to U.S.-born women dropped by 11 percent during that same time period, from 3.46 million in 1970 to 3.10 million in 2014,‚Äù added Pew.",1
Surge of Migrants Illegally Crossing U.S.-Mexico Border Ahead of Election,"Surge of Migrants Illegally Crossing U.S.-Mexico Border Ahead of Election Manuel Bojorquez, CBS News, October 25, 2016

Hispanic Crowd Boos Marco Rubio off Stage,"Hispanic Crowd Boos Marco Rubio off Stage Rafael Bernal, The Hill, October 25, 2016 
Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) took the stage in Orlando at Calle Orange, a Puerto Rican-themed festival, on Sunday when some in the crowd started booing, NPR reported . 
The jeering got louder as the Cuban-American senator, seeking reelection after dropping his presidential bid earlier this year, was introduced. 
And when the emcee asked for applause as Rubio took the same, boos drowned out any supporters in the crowd, NPR added. 
‚ÄúThank you for having me today,‚Äù Rubio said in Spanish. ‚ÄúI want you to enjoy this day. We‚Äôre not going to talk about politics today. Thank God for this beautiful day, and for our freedom, our democracy, our vote, and our country. God bless you all, thank you very much.‚Äù 
He left the stage to more boos from the crowd, according to the report. 
{snip} 
Rubio is running against Rep. Patrick Murphy (D), and the latest average of polls in the race shows Rubio ahead by about 3 points. 
Murphy‚Äôs campaign seized on the Sunday incident and blasted out video it says shows the booing. It also noted that Murphy attended the festival ‚Äúwith a leader for Puerto Rican communities, Rep. Nydia Velazquez,‚Äù while ‚ÄúMarco Rubio was booed off the stage.‚Äù 
Rubio‚Äôs campaign shared a video with The Hill Monday that it says counters what the Murphy campaign sent out and shows him being greeted enthusiastically as he moves through the crowd.

"Justice Department Faces Uphill Battle Should Officer Daniel Pantaleo Be Charged in Eric Garner Case, Experts Say","Loading Posted on October 26, 2016 Justice Department Faces Uphill Battle Should Officer Daniel Pantaleo Be Charged in Eric Garner Case, Experts Say John Marzulli, NY Daily News, October 25, 2016 
As the Justice Department looks to indict NYPD Office Daniel Pantaleo by year‚Äôs end in the civil rights probe of the Eric Garner police chokehold case, experts said Tuesday that bitter in-fighting between prosecutors has made a potential trial a defense lawyer‚Äôs dream. 
The probe is now firmly in the hands of the Department of Justice in Washington, D.C., which appears to have overruled recommendations from Brooklyn prosecutors and FBI investigators not to indict the NYPD cop, sources said. 
The New York-based feds determined they could not bring a criminal civil rights case against Officer Pantaleo for Garner‚Äôs death‚Äìleading the Department of Justice to take control of the case. 
Defense lawyers and former prosecutors said the unusual split opens a trove of evidence that could potentially help Pantaleo if he‚Äôs indicted. 
When U.S. Attorney General Loretta Lynch gives the department‚Äôs civil rights division the green light to charge Pantaleo with violating Garner‚Äôs civil rights, it could reveal the deep division between the branches of the Justice Department. 
The key, however, is the defense getting its hands on the information and being allowed by a judge to quiz witnesses about it, the sources said. 
{snip} 
The federal civil rights criminal case would hinge on proving that Pantaleo ‚Äúintended‚Äù to violate Garner‚Äôs civil rights, which is a high threshold because it aims to get inside the cop‚Äôs head when he brought Garner to the ground. 
{snip} 
Defense lawyer Eric Franz said he would seek any prosecutorial memos regarding justification of a federal civil rights charge to examine the factual reasons behind the Brooklyn office‚Äôs recommendation, but agreed it remains a longshot. 
A greater problem is the damage this dispute is doing to the Justice Department‚Äôs credibility, Franz said. 
‚ÄúI have enormous respect for Mr. Capers (Robert Capers, Brooklyn U.S. attorney) and his office, and they were in the best position to determine whether charges are warranted,‚Äù he said.

Anti-Trump Violence Sweeps the Nation,"Anti-Trump Violence Sweeps the Nation Matthew Vadum, LifeZette, October 26, 2016 
While the mainstream media has been working day and night promoting Hillary Clinton‚Äôs candidacy, it has largely ignored or downplayed violent attacks against supporters of Donald Trump. 
But assaults on Trump supporters appear to be growing increasingly common as Election Day approaches and tensions intensify. Reports of Trump lawn signs and banners being stolen and defaced are everywhere on social media. 
Making matters worse, undercover video evidence emerged showing senior Democrat operatives Robert Creamer and Scott Foval acknowledging using dirty, likely illegal tricks against the Trump campaign. Their goal was to generate negative media coverage of Trump rallies by fomenting violence at them. The media eagerly used the various fisticuffs and melees the Democrats created to attempt to discredit Trump by depicting his supporters as violent, knuckle-dragging crazies. 
{snip} 
Despite their aversion to covering stories that put Trump in a sympathetic light, members of the media had no choice but to cover the extremely newsworthy Oct. 15 weekend firebombing of Republican Party headquarters in Orange County, North Carolina. Gov. Pat McCrory called the arson ‚Äúan attack on our democracy,‚Äù while one GOP official called it an act of ‚Äúpolitical terrorism.‚Äù Spray-painted on the building next door were a swastika and the sentence ‚ÄúNazi Republicans get out of town or else.‚Äù 
Meanwhile, most physical attacks on Trump supporters make only local news outlet‚Äìif that. Rarely do such assaults get mentioned on the evening TV broadcast news or in The New York Times or The Washington Post. That‚Äôs because they don‚Äôt fit the leftist narrative that Republicans are violent, racist, Islamophobic homophobes. 
{snip} 
Here is a compilation of some of the attacks on Trump supporters: 
On Oct. 15 in Bangor, Maine, vandals spray-painted about 20 parked cars outside a Trump rally. Trump supporter Paul Foster, whose van was hit with white paint, told reporters, ‚ÄúWhy can‚Äôt they do a peaceful protest instead of painting cars, all of this, to make their statement?‚Äù 
Around Oct. 3, a couple of Trump supporters were assaulted in Zeitgeist, a San Francisco bar, after they were allegedly refused service for expressing support for Trump, GotNews reports. ‚ÄúThe two Trump supporters were attacked, punched, and chased into the street by ‚Äòsome thugs‚Äô that a barmaid called out from the back.‚Äù Lilian Kim of ABC 7 Bay Area tweeted a photo of the men, in which one was wearing a Trump T-shirt and the other was wearing a ‚ÄúBlue Lives Matter‚Äù shirt. 
On Sept. 28 in El Cajon, California, an angry mob at a Black Lives Matter protest beat 21-year-old Trump supporter Feras Jabro for wearing a ‚ÄúMake America Great Again‚Äù baseball cap. The assault was broadcast live using the smartphone app Periscope. 
On Sept. 26 at Gustavus Adolphus College in St. Peter, Minnesota, as the first presidential debate was about to get underway, a woman wearing Trump campaign apparel was assaulted while heading to a debate watch event. {snip} 
On Aug. 19 in Minneapolis, Minnesota, Trump supporters had to run a gauntlet of angry protesters to get into a Trump fundraiser at the Minneapolis Convention Center. When they left after the event they were hit, pushed, and spit on. 
{snip} 
On Aug. 3 in Bloomfield, New Jersey, an assailant attacked a 62-year-old man who was walking down the street wearing a pro-Trump T-shirt, local police said. ‚ÄúThe motorist inquired why [the man] was wearing the shirt, directing profanities at him,‚Äù a police spokesman said. ‚ÄúThe [victim] continued to walk away as [the] motorist followed him.‚Äù The motorist hit the man several times with a crowbar, causing injuries to his arms, hands, and thighs, 
{snip} 
This is not an exhaustive list of violent attacks on Trump supporters. 
No doubt there will be plenty more such assaults in the final two weeks, as Americans head to the polls. 
And Hillary Clinton‚Äôs campaign may be involved in those attacks.",1
"Fearing Election Day Trouble, Some US Schools Cancel Classes","Fearing Election Day Trouble, Some US Schools Cancel Classes Newsmax, October 26, 2016 
Rigged elections. Vigilante observers. Angry voters. The claims, threats and passions surrounding the presidential race have led communities around the U.S. to move polling places out of schools or cancel classes on Election Day. 
The fear is that the ugly rhetoric of the campaign could escalate into confrontations and even violence in school hallways, endangering students. 
‚ÄúIf anybody can sit there and say they don‚Äôt think this is a contentious election, then they aren‚Äôt paying much attention,‚Äù said Ed Tolan, police chief in Falmouth, Maine, which decided to call off classes on Election Day and put additional officers on duty Nov. 8. 
{snip} 
Schools are popular polling places because they have plenty of parking and are usually centrally located. It‚Äôs difficult to say how many school-based polling places have been moved this year, given how decentralized the voting process is across the country. 
But state and local officials say voting has been removed or classes have been canceled on Election Day at schools in Illinois, Maine, Nebraska, New Hampshire, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Wisconsin and elsewhere. 
‚ÄúThere is a concern, just like at a concert, sporting event or other public gathering, that we didn‚Äôt have 15 or 20 years ago. What if someone walks in a polling location with a backpack bomb or something?‚Äù said Georgia Secretary of State Brian Kemp, co-chairman of the National Association of Secretaries of State election committee. ‚ÄúIf that happens at a school, then that‚Äôs certainly concerning.‚Äù 
{snip} 
Easton Superintendent John Reinhart wanted to get voting out of schools altogether but was rebuffed by county election officials. So the school board canceled classes on Election Day. 
‚ÄúIf you take the personalities away and cast the emotion with the election aside, one has to ask the question: ‚ÄòAre our schools the best places for that activity to take place?'‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúI just think we‚Äôve reached the point where we need to look at other locations.‚Äù

Minnesota Somali Groups Join to Speak with One Voice at Capitol,"Minnesota Somali Groups Join to Speak with One Voice at Capitol Mila Koumpilova, Star Tribune, October 25, 2016 
Minnesota‚Äôs largest Somali nonprofits are teaming up to present a unified lobbying front to the state this winter. 
In recent months, the leaders of eight Somali community groups joined forces on several projects, hired a lobbyist and scored face time with the state‚Äôs lieutenant governor. Now, the new coalition is gearing up to ask state legislators for about $11 million for Somali community initiatives, building on $2 million Gov. Mark Dayton earmarked for such projects in this year‚Äôs budget. 
‚ÄúWhy not combine our separate efforts and do a better collaborative effort?‚Äù said Mohamud Noor, head of the Confederation of Somali Community, a coalition member. 
Spearheaded by the Minneapolis Foundation, the initiative is also a bid to nudge Somali-American nonprofits to better track and report results. 
A University of Southern California study last year found Somali-Americans celebrate the work of some leaders of 35 registered nonprofits and a host of more informal groups. But they distrust others. Study participants perceived some self-styled community leaders‚Äìdubbed ‚Äúthe Pretenders‚Äù‚Äìas adept at applying for grants but with little to show for it. 
{snip} 
This year‚Äôs state budget includes $2 million for investments in the Somali community‚Äìpart of Dayton‚Äôs package of $35 million for addressing racial disparities in Minnesota. The Minnesota Department of Employment and Economic Development, and the nonprofit Youthprise each received roughly half of the money, which they will distribute in grants. The department is now weighing 30 proposals worth a total of $6.7 million for its half. 
‚ÄúThe $2 million wasn‚Äôt even close to being sufficient,‚Äù Warfa said. ‚ÄúWe are asking for more money.‚Äù 
Weli says the group also wants to push the state to entrust Somali-led nonprofits with funds directly, rather than steering resources to state agencies. 
‚ÄúThe system is not structured so that people of color serve themselves,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúThey are always the recipients of services.‚Äù 
{snip} 
The group is calling for investments to encourage entrepreneurship and homeownership, expand mental health services, provide culturally sensitive prenatal care and spur youth leadership. 
A more specific proposal is still a work in progress, leaders acknowledge. 
{snip} 
Mohamed Ahmed, a creator of cartoons lampooning extremists, who is not part of the coalition, says many in the community feel acute mistrust of local nonprofits and community leaders. 
‚ÄúYou can literally throw a stone and hit a nonprofit in the community; there are so many of them, God help us,‚Äù said Ahmed, whose Average Mohamed initiative recently became a nonprofit as well. ‚ÄúAccountability and monitoring effectiveness are big issues.‚Äù 
Ahmed says Warfa is well-respected, and a group of nonprofits that will hold each other accountable is a promising step.

Gambia Joins South Africa and Burundi in Exodus from International Criminal Court,"Gambia Joins South Africa and Burundi in Exodus from International Criminal Court AFP, October 26, 2016 
Gambia has announced its withdrawal from the International Criminal Court (ICC), accusing the Hague-based tribunal of the ‚Äúpersecution and humiliation of people of colour, especially Africans‚Äù. 
The announcement late Tuesday comes after similar decisions this month by South Africa and Burundi to abandon the troubled institution, set up to try the world‚Äôs worst crimes. 
Information Minister Sheriff Bojang said in an announcement on state television that the court had been used ‚Äúfor the persecution of Africans and especially their leaders‚Äù while ignoring crimes committed by the West. 
He singled out the case of former British prime minister Tony Blair, who the ICC decided not to indict over the Iraq war. 
{snip} 
The withdrawal, he said, ‚Äúis warranted by the fact that the ICC, despite being called International Criminal Court, is in fact an International Caucasian Court for the persecution and humiliation of people of colour, especially Africans‚Äù. 
The ICC, set up in 2002, is often accused of bias against Africa and has also struggled with a lack of cooperation, including from the United States, which has signed the court‚Äôs treaty but never ratified it. 
Gambia has been trying without success to use the court to punish the European Union for deaths of thousands of African migrants trying to reach its shores.

South Africa‚Äôs decision followed a dispute last year when Sudanese President Omar al-Bashir visited the country despite being the subject of an ICC arrest warrant over alleged war crimes.

Every ethnic group except whites bloc-votes for the Democrats. Coincidentally, the Democrats have brought in another 30 to 40 million nonwhite immigrants in the last few decades. 
It doesn‚Äôt help that white voters can‚Äôt agree on what constitutes an acceptable candidate. In 2012, working-class whites sat out the election, rather than vote for the out-of-touch rich guy they saw in Mitt Romney. This year, the out-of-touch rich guys say they‚Äôll vote for Hillary because Trump is tacky and gross. 
The sad irony is that the only people who will be better off in our new country are mostly white plutocrats‚Äìthe top .01 percent. The rest of us will be their servants. 
The people who will be worse off are everybody else‚Äìthe working class, the middle class (who will soon be working class) and, most of all, women, minorities, children, the elderly, the weakest and most vulnerable members of society.

Speaking in Charlotte, N.C., the GOP presidential nominee criticized years of Democratic rule for leaving black America behind and outlined his plan to help. 
My ‚Äúdeal is grounded in three promises: safe communities, great education and high-paying jobs,‚Äù Trump said, speaking off what appeared to be scripted remarks 
‚ÄúWhether you vote for me or not, I will be your greatest champion. We live in a very divided country, and I will be your greatest champion.‚Äù

Trump called for incentives to move companies into blighted neighborhoods to bolster employment, help African-Americans get better access to credit and push cities to declare ‚Äúblighted communities‚Äù disaster areas to help rebuild infrastructure. 
He also said he‚Äôd support increasing the number of police officers in such areas, connecting a lack of officers to a rise in murder rate in major cities.

Are Detroit‚Äôs Most Terrible Schools Unconstitutional?,"Are Detroit‚Äôs Most Terrible Schools Unconstitutional? Geoffrey R. Stone, New York Times, October 21, 2016 
At one Detroit school, just 4 percent of third graders scored proficient on Michigan‚Äôs English assessment test. At another, 9.5 percent did. Those students are among the plaintiffs in a lawsuit filed last month that asserts that children have a federal constitutional right to the opportunity to learn to read and write. 
Illiteracy is the norm at those ‚Äúslumlike‚Äù schools and others in Michigan‚Äôs biggest city, according to the plaintiffs. The facilities are decrepit and unsafe. The first thing some teachers do each morning is clean up rodent feces before their students arrive. In some cases, teachers buy the books and school supplies, even the toilet paper. 
Lawyers for the students are arguing, in effect, that Michigan is denying their clients the right to a minimally adequate education, an issue that has been raised over the years in courts in other states under their state constitutions. 
{snip} 
Now the litigation in Detroit is raising this issue under the United States Constitution. The Supreme Court has never addressed whether disparities among schools would be constitutionally permissible if, as the court put it in 1973, a state failed ‚Äúto provide each child with an opportunity to acquire the basic minimal skills necessary‚Äù for success in life. 
In that bitterly divided 5-4 decision, San Antonio Independent School District v. Rodriguez, the court upheld a Texas law that produced unequal levels of education to students living in different school districts based on the property tax revenues of each district. 
The majority maintained that the law was constitutional because it served a rational policy of permitting each school district to decide for itself how much money to spend on education. Whether the level of education was at least minimally adequate in the state‚Äôs poorest schools was not at issue in the case. 
In what is likely to be the opening chapter in a long legal saga, a federal district judge in Michigan must determine if a state can constitutionally provide a vast majority of its students with an excellent or at least adequate education while a minority of students receive an education that denies them the chance to acquire the minimum skills the court spoke of 43 years ago in Rodriguez. 
{snip} 
But in the case of children who are attending a public school, how do we know whether a state has denied some of its children even the minimal level of education required by the 14th Amendment? That is the burden that the plaintiffs in the Detroit case must meet. After reviewing their evidence, the case seems to be open-and-shut. 
As the plaintiffs demonstrate, ‚Äúdecades of state disinvestment in and deliberate indifference to the Detroit schools‚Äù have denied these children ‚Äúaccess to the most basic building block of education: literacy.‚Äù At the schools involved in this litigation, which serve almost exclusively low-income minority children, the student proficiency rates ‚Äúhover near zero in nearly all core subject areas.‚Äù At one school, for example, 100 percent of the sixth graders scored below proficiency in reading.

Armstrong: Stop Trying to Make Temple Attacks About Race,"Jenice Armstrong, Philly, October 26, 2016 
The Temple attacks were about troublemaking teens‚Äìnot race. 
The youngsters who jumped those college students as they walked to campus Friday night are delinquents who need to be put in check before it‚Äôs too late. 
They were nothing but miscreants who took out their aggression and misdirected rage on random passersby. Why? Because they felt like wilding out that night. They were out to create chaos, so they did. 
So, don‚Äôt talk to me about gentrification in North Philly. 
Don‚Äôt talk to me about poverty. 
Don‚Äôt talk to me about race relations. 
Those are whole other conversations and not what these attacks were about. 
No one was safe from these teens that night. Not the six Temple students who were injured. Not the Temple police officer knocked from her bicycle by a 15-year-old. Not even a police horse. Anyone could have gotten caught up in that madness. 
According to news reports, a crowd of 150 youngsters started gathering after an Instagram advertised an 8 p.m. meet-up at the AMC North Broad Street 7 (formerly the Pearl Theater at Avenue North), on Broad Street near Oxford at the southern end of the campus. 
{snip} 
Most of the high schoolers who responded to the online posting were good kids looking to socialize. But then the delinquents did what they often do and ruined it for everybody. 
According to police, a group of 20 to 30 boys and girls in their early to late teens randomly attacked Temple students as they returned from a football game at Lincoln Financial Field. 
{snip} 
People keep trying to make this a racial thing because at least two of the victims were white and all of the assailants were African American. They make that assumption even though we don‚Äôt know the race of the other injured students. (Lots of African Americans go to Temple.) Nor do we know the race of the injured officers. 
Street violence is street violence. It knows no skin color. {snip} 
{snip} 
Another student, a junior environmental science major who didn‚Äôt give her name, told a website called theTab.com, ‚ÄúMy boyfriend ran and got away but the second I tried to run, they grabbed me by my hair and started beating my head and back. 
‚ÄúI remember shoes coming for my face and after that I heard other kids from the group saying, ‚ÄòYo chill, yo chill, it‚Äôs just a girl,‚Äô and they pulled my attackers off me.‚Äù

Temple has promised increased security, but when it comes to random street violence, anything can happen to anyone‚Äìblack or white.",1
"Chicago ‚ÄòHits Back,‚Äô Strips Trump of Honorary Street Designation","Chicago ‚ÄòHits Back,‚Äô Strips Trump of Honorary Street Designation Fran Spielman, Chicago Sun-Times, October 25, 2016 
Chicago aldermen on Tuesday hit Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump where it hurts‚Äìin his formidable ego‚Äìfor using a spike in homicides and shootings to paint a ‚Äúdistorted caricature‚Äù of the city. 
The City Council‚Äôs Transportation Committee unanimously agreed to strip Trump of a recognition he covets: ‚ÄúTrump Plaza,‚Äù the honorary designation for the east side of Wabash Avenue between Illinois Street and the Chicago River, outside the 96-story Trump International Hotel & Tower. 
‚ÄúWe can actually use his own words against him: ‚ÄòWhen you hit us, we hit back,‚Äô ‚Äù said Transportation Committee Chairman Anthony Beale (9th). 
‚ÄúYou‚Äôve hit Chicago numerous times. . . . When you hit Chicago, Chicago hits back.‚Äù 
{snip} 
As for the honorary street designation, one of the Trump Plaza signs already has been stolen. So only one more needs to be removed. That will be done post-haste, if the full City Council approves the punishment, thanks to a so-called ‚Äúpending passage‚Äù letter that Beale promised to sign. 
Reilly said Trump no longer deserves the honor after making political hay at Chicago‚Äôs expense in a way that has damaged the city‚Äôs reputation on the global stage. 
Trump‚Äôs decision to portray Chicago as a ‚Äúwar zone‚Äù that needs stop-and-frisk during the first presidential debate was the final straw. 
‚ÄúHe was comparing us to a war-torn, third-world country. That was a set of comments that didn‚Äôt just insult me. It insulted anyone who loves this great city,‚Äù Reilly said.

"Don‚Äôt Root, Root, Root for the Racist, Red-Face Team from Cleveland","Don‚Äôt Root, Root, Root for the Racist, Red-Face Team from Cleveland Paul Thornton, Los Angeles Times, October 26, 2016 
How I wish it were the Dodgers who took the field Tuesday night in Cleveland. Yes, we‚Äôre all sad in Los Angeles that our team is now one year closer to celebrating the 30th anniversary of its last World Series appearance, but this goes beyond provincialism and wounded civil pride. 
The Dodgers deserved the chance to humiliate a Cleveland baseball team that not only persists in identifying itself as the ‚ÄúIndians,‚Äù but also resurrected the laughably racist, red-faced mascot Chief Wahoo just in time for the playoffs. 
For those who haven‚Äôt kept up with the baseball drama, here‚Äôs a summary: The Cleveland team drew the curtain on its regular-season minstrel show in the spring, having replaced Chief Wahoo on its caps with a vintage red ‚ÄúC.‚Äù It never officially retired the offending mascot, but Wahoo remained confined only to uniform sleeves throughout the regular season, leading reasonable people to believe that the team ownership had finally seen the light where other franchises such as the NFL‚Äôs Washington Redskins remained defiantly in the dark, and was easing its fans into the post-‚ÄúIndians‚Äù era. 
Or so we thought. Chief Wahoo reappeared when the Cleveland team began its impressive playoff run against the Boston Red Sox, and he hasn‚Äôt left. He remained stitched on hats and held aloft by adoring Cleveland fans as the team convincingly defeated the Toronto Blue Jays, even surviving a legal attack by advocates of Canada‚Äôs indigenous peoples that threatened to forbid even so much as the use of the term ‚ÄúIndians‚Äù while the team was on Canadian soil. 
{snip} 
It‚Äôs tempting to look past all this and take pity on a city that‚Äôs had it as rough as Cleveland. The Cubs‚Äô championship drought has famously lasted for 107 baseball seasons, but the Cleveland team boasts a pitiable 67 years without a World Series title. Beyond sports, Cleveland‚Äôs decline as an important American metropolis is arguably unmatched, having tumbled from a population peak of 900,000-plus in 1950 to less than 400,000 today. {snip} 
But Cleveland? Hey, I know some generous, wonderfully caring people from that part of Ohio, which makes wishing for their team‚Äôs brutal defeat personally difficult. But being on the right side of a moral dispute isn‚Äôt supposed to be easy, especially when the team in question isn‚Äôt the evil Washington Redskins and its infernal owner, Daniel Snyder. Cleveland‚Äôs municipal misery doesn‚Äôt excuse the disgraceful exalting of Chief Wahoo any more than white men‚Äôs economic hardship makes Donald Trump‚Äôs popularity OK.

Students to Protest ‚ÄòMikado‚Äô for Lack of Engagement with Controversial Past,"Students to Protest ‚ÄòMikado‚Äô for Lack of Engagement with Controversial Past Derek G. Xiao, Harvard Crimson, October 27, 2016 
A group of Asian American students is planning to protest the Harvard-Radcliffe Gilbert and Sullivan Players‚Äô upcoming production of ‚ÄúThe Mikado‚Äù for how it handles the racial stereotypes that characterize traditional performances of the opera. 
Organized by George S. Qiao ‚Äô18, the group of students had publicized their protest over various email lists, describing what they consider inadequate attempts to remove the Japanese stereotypes and appropriation of Japanese culture that remained latent in the adapted production‚Äôs storyline. But later Qiao said that he thought the tone of his initial concerns was unfair to the Players. 
‚ÄúI fully believe that members of the Gilbert and Sullivan Players put their blood, sweat, and tears into trying to improve this staging of the production,‚Äù Qiao said. ‚ÄúHowever, I believe that there is still insufficient critical engagement [with] this play‚Äôs history of Japanese cultural misrepresentation.‚Äù 
Penned in 1884, ‚ÄúThe Mikado‚Äù is a comical opera, set in the fictional Japanese town of Titipu and meant to satirically mask criticism of British political culture and bureaucracy with grossly exaggerated ‚ÄúAsian‚Äù names and stereotypical cultural caricatures. 
{snip} Hoping to avoid these issues in their own production, the board of the Gilbert and Sullivan Players made some changes to the setting and script of the opera, characterizing their rendition as a ‚Äúreimagining‚Äù of the original production. 
‚ÄúThe board of the Harvard-Radcliffe Gilbert & Sullivan Players, whose mission is to produce the full canon of Gilbert and Sullivan‚Äôs shows, faced a dilemma this past January,‚Äù Kathleen C. Zhou ‚Äô17, the president of the Players, wrote in an op-ed for The Crimson Tuesday. ‚ÄúStrike ‚ÄòThe Mikado‚Äô from our season, and ignore one of the most problematic but well-known G&S; shows, or try to confront it by reimagining it and subverting authorial intent.‚Äù 
The setting of their show is no longer the 19th century town of Titipu, and instead is now 20th century ‚ÄúLas Vegas themed Oriental hotel.‚Äù And, the opening number ‚ÄúGentlemen of Japan‚Äù has been rewritten as ‚ÄúGentlemen of the Strip.‚Äù 
{snip} 
Zhou said in an interview that in rethinking the comical opera‚Äôs script, the complete omission of all of the original production‚Äôs issues was ‚Äúan erasure in itself in that it does not acknowledge how problematic the show has been to [Asians].‚Äù

Japan‚Äôs Population Declines in 2015 for First Time Since 1920,"Japan‚Äôs Population Declines in 2015 for First Time Since 1920 Japan Times, October 27, 2016 
Japan‚Äôs population stood at 127,094,745 as of Oct. 1, 2015, the final results of the census showed, down 0.8 percent from the previous census five years earlier and marking the first decline since the survey began in 1920. 
Of the total population, including non-Japanese residents, those aged 65 or older accounted for a record-high 26.6 percent, while those below 15 years old fell to a record-low 12.6 percent, the internal affairs ministry said. 
The government data showed that the number of people 65 or older rose 3.6 percentage points from the previous census in 2010 to 33,465,441. In contrast, those 14 or younger fell by 0.6 points to 15,886,810. 
Comparing the new census figures against U.N. estimates, Japan remains the 10th-most populous nation. However, among the top 20 countries, it was the only one whose population declined between 2010 and 2015. 
The latest results by the census, conducted every five years, also showed that the population is concentrated in Tokyo and its vicinity. 
Of the 47 prefectures, the capital and neighboring Saitama, Chiba and Kanagawa prefectures accounted for 28.4 percent of the total population. 
The population rose only in eight prefectures‚Äìthe four above as well as Aichi, Shiga, Fukuoka and Okinawa. 
The population of Japanese nationals totaled 124,283,901, while the number of non-Japanese residents in the country totaled 1,752,368, the government data showed. 
By nationality, Chinese nationals accounted for the largest number of expatriates at 511,118, followed by people from both South Korea and North Korea together at 376,954. 
Of the country‚Äôs 1,719 municipalities, the populations in 1,419 of them decreased, according to the census. 
The male population totaled 61,841,738, while the female population stood at 65,253,007. 
Tokyo had the lowest number of people in a household at 1.99, falling below 2 for the first time since the government began compiling such information in 1970, the data showed. The national average of members per household is 2.33. 
The preliminary figures for the census, released in February, showed the country‚Äôs population fell by 947,305 from 128,057,352 in 2010.",1
Chinese Immigrants Demand Protection from Paris Muggers,"Chinese Immigrants Demand Protection from Paris Muggers David Chazan, Telegraph, August 21, 2016 
Thousands of angry Chinese immigrants demonstrated in a Paris suburb yesterday (Sun) to demand police protection from muggers who they say prey on them because they are seen as easy targets. 
The death of a 49-year-old Chinese tailor after being badly beaten in a robbery earlier this month has lent new urgency to the long running complaint that Asian immigrants are systematically attacked and robbed in the French capital. 
‚ÄúThe Chinese community is dying in silence,‚Äù read a slogan on a T-shirt splashed with red to symbolise bloodstains worn by one demonstrator, Maike Song. 
He said he joined the protest in Aubervilliers to pay homage to Chaoling Zhang, the father of two who died on August 14 after being punched to ground in the north-eastern suburb that is home to some 4,000 Chinese immigrants. 
No arrests have been made over the attack. 
About 100 Chinese residents of Aubervilliers have been attacked and robbed since November, according to the Franco-Chinese Friendship Association. 
‚ÄúIt is because of prejudices that Chinese people are weak, docile and wealthy,‚Äù said Fang, a young female student. ‚ÄúI‚Äôve been attacked three times in three years and my friends are suffering the same thing. Some have moved away from this area because of it. I don‚Äôt go out with a handbag any more.‚Äù 
Community workers say many muggings are committed by members of other minorities living in the area, generally of Arab or African origin. 
Paris officials corroborated the figures but declined to identify the robbers by ethnic origin. 
Many Chinese immigrants own restaurants or shops and tend to be relatively well-off, but are often reluctant to go to the police. ‚ÄúSome victims have been illegal immigrants,‚Äù said Dominique Darden, a social worker. 
The Chinese community of Paris has held other protests in recent years over the attacks. 
‚ÄúThey happen almost every day because of poverty but it‚Äôs unbearable,‚Äù said a spokesman, Olivier Wang. ‚ÄúNo one should have to put up with this.‚Äù",1
Facebook Lets Advertisers Exclude Users by Race,"Facebook Lets Advertisers Exclude Users by Race Julia Angwin and Terry Parris Jr., Pro Publica, October 28, 2016 
Imagine if, during the Jim Crow era, a newspaper offered advertisers the option of placing ads only in copies that went to white readers. 
That‚Äôs basically what Facebook is doing nowadays. 
The ubiquitous social network not only allows advertisers to target users by their interests or background, it also gives advertisers the ability to exclude specific groups it calls ‚ÄúEthnic Affinities.‚Äù Ads that exclude people based on race, gender and other sensitive factors are prohibited by federal law in housing and employment. 
{snip} 
The ad we purchased was targeted to Facebook members who were house hunting and excluded anyone with an ‚Äúaffinity‚Äù for African-American, Asian-American or Hispanic people. ( Here‚Äôs the ad itself .) 
When we showed Facebook‚Äôs racial exclusion options to a prominent civil rights lawyer John Relman , he gasped and said, ‚ÄúThis is horrifying. This is massively illegal. This is about as blatant a violation of the federal Fair Housing Act as one can find.‚Äù 
The Fair Housing Act of 1968 makes it illegal ‚Äúto make, print, or publish, or cause to be made, printed, or published any notice, statement, or advertisement, with respect to the sale or rental of a dwelling that indicates any preference, limitation, or discrimination based on race, color, religion, sex, handicap, familial status, or national origin.‚Äù Violators can face tens of thousands of dollars in fines . 
The Civil Rights Act of 1964 also prohibits the ‚Äúprinting or publication of notices or advertisements indicating prohibited preference, limitation, specification or discrimination‚Äù in employment recruitment. 
{snip} 
Facebook says its policies prohibit advertisers from using the targeting options for discrimination, harassment, disparagement or predatory advertising practices. 
‚ÄúWe take a strong stand against advertisers misusing our platform: Our policies prohibit using our targeting options to discriminate, and they require compliance with the law,‚Äù said Steve Satterfield, privacy and public policy manager at Facebook. ‚ÄúWe take prompt enforcement action when we determine that ads violate our policies.‚Äù 
{snip} 
He said Facebook began offering the ‚ÄúEthnic Affinity‚Äù categories within the past two years as part of a ‚Äúmulticultural advertising‚Äù effort. 
Satterfield added that the ‚ÄúEthnic Affinity‚Äù is not the same as race‚Äìwhich Facebook does not ask its members about. Facebook assigns members an ‚ÄúEthnic Affinity‚Äù based on pages and posts they have liked or engaged with on Facebook. 
When we asked why ‚ÄúEthnic Affinity‚Äù was included in the ‚ÄúDemographics‚Äù category of its ad-targeting tool if it‚Äôs not a representation of demographics, Facebook responded that it plans to move ‚ÄúEthnic Affinity‚Äù to another section. 
Facebook declined to answer questions about why our housing ad excluding minority groups was approved 15 minutes after we placed the order.

Media Self-Destruct over Trump,"Posted on October 28, 2016 Media Self-Destruct over Trump Jared Taylor, American Renaissance, October 28, 2016 Their hysteria and dishonesty have backfired. 
From the start of Donald Trump‚Äôs campaign, the media have covered him dishonestly. They have consistently portrayed him as a closet ‚Äúwhite supremacist‚Äù who deliberately appeals to ‚Äúracists.‚Äù They have tried to tie him to a wicked movement known as the ‚ÄúAlt-Right.‚Äù They are now working on another dishonest angle: that Donald Trump is ‚Äúmainstreaming hate‚Äù and bringing ‚Äúracism‚Äù into public discourse. The media clearly want to stampede voters into Mrs. Clinton‚Äôs camp so as to spare us the agony of a ‚Äúracist‚Äù in the White House. 
The demonization campaign has backfired. By trying to hang racial dissidents around Donald Trump‚Äôs neck, the media have given American Renaissance and other organizations far more publicity than ever before. At the same time, constant shouts of ‚Äúracist‚Äù and ‚Äúbigot‚Äù don‚Äôt seem to hurt Mr. Trump: instead they are wrecking what is left of media credibility. The biggest irony, though, is that Donald Trump is probably not one of us at all. But even small deviations from the cast-iron orthodoxy of race are enough to plunge our rulers into dark fantasies about Donald Trump as a secret David Duke fan. 
Media dishonesty started immediately. When Mr. Trump pointed out that some immigrants from Mexico were criminals, the press acted as if he had said all Mexican immigrants are criminals. Then, when alert news hounds discovered that those of us they love to call ‚Äúhaters‚Äù and ‚Äúwhite supremacists‚Äù liked Mr. Trump, there was no end of articles with titles such as: ‚Äú Meet the Horde of Neo-Nazis, Klansmen, and Other Extremist Leaders Endorsing Donald Trump ,‚Äù ‚Äú Top Racists And Neo-Nazis Back Donald Trump ,‚Äù ‚Äú ‚ÄòHeil Donald Trump‚Äô: Neo-Nazis, White Supremacists Show Support ,‚Äù and ‚Äú The White Nationalists Who Support Donald Trump .‚Äù 
These articles had a simpleminded purpose: discredit Mr. Trump by parading before the reader any Nazi, Kluxer, or racially conscious white person who had anything nice to say about the candidate. The implication was that if ‚Äúracists‚Äù were going to vote for Donald Trump he must be ‚Äúracist,‚Äù too. 
This was deceitful and one-sided. When the chairman of the American Communist Party endorsed Hillary Clinton , no one suggested this meant she was a communist. 
It is true that Mr. Trump gave the media just enough of an excuse to pretend he really is a closet ‚Äúbigot‚Äù because he did not repudiate ‚Äúracists‚Äù with the snorts of indignation respectability requires. There was the famous exchange in February when a reporter pushed Mr. Trump to disavow an endorsement from David Duke. As The Hill reported it: ‚Äú ‚ÄòDavid Duke endorsed me? OK, alright. I disavow, OK?‚Äô Trump said, seeking to quickly move on to another question.‚Äù 
That same month, there was another famous exchange with Jake Tapper of CNN : 
Tapper : Will you unequivocally condemn David Duke and say that you don‚Äôt want his vote or that of other white supremacists in this election? 
Donald Trump : Well just so you understand, I don‚Äôt know anything about David Duke, OK? I don‚Äôt know anything about what you‚Äôre even talking about with white supremacy or white supremacists. So, I don‚Äôt know. I don‚Äôt know, did he endorse me, or what‚Äôs going on? Because, you know, I know nothing about David Duke. I know nothing about white supremacists. 
The media leaped on these exchanges with shouts of joy. ‚ÄúTrump refuses to disavow white supremacists! That‚Äôs because he is one!‚Äù 
There are far better explanations. First, Donald Trump is a pugnacious man. He doesn‚Äôt like being pushed around by anyone, especially not by journalists who hate him. If Mr. Tapper had belligerently demanded that Mr. Trump agree that the sky is blue, Mr. Trump would have bridled at that. 
Second, Donald Trump probably doesn‚Äôt know anything about David Duke or white supremacy. I would be astonished if he has ever looked into the thinking of David Duke or any other alleged ‚Äúwhite supremacist.‚Äù It is his feistiness and his ignorance of white advocacy that explain his answers, not some carefully concealed racial consciousness. 
The press has also pounced on Donald Trump‚Äôs retweets of ‚Äúracist‚Äù material, which is supposed to be yet more proof that he is a secret supremacist. Business Insider, for example, published this shocking story: ‚Äú 5 times Donald Trump has engaged with alt-right racists on Twitter .‚Äù Not one of these tweets is obviously ‚Äúracist,‚Äù and it would be surprising if Mr. Trump or his skeleton staff took the time to vet the sources of the thousands of tweets @realDonaldTrump has sent during the campaign. 
Now the press is working on another smear-Trump angle. Recently, I have been contacted by journalists from such places as Bloomberg News, Reuters, and the New York Times , who clearly want to write that Donald Trump is ‚Äúmainstreaming hate,‚Äù that he is responsible for a huge surge in the Alt-Right. They want to know about all the people who have been flocking to AmRen.com because of what Donald Trump says. They want me to tell them about people who have been ‚Äúemboldened‚Äù to ‚Äúspeak out against minorities‚Äù because Donald Trump has led the way. They would love to find someone who now thinks he is free to run down the street shouting ‚Äúnigger!‚Äù because Mr. Trump wants to take a hard look at Muslim immigrants. 
I have explained to them as patiently as I can that they have it the wrong way around. No one comes looking for AmRen.com because Donald Trump wants to build a wall. They come looking for us because the media have written about us in their attempt to convince the world that Mr. Trump is a ‚Äúracist.‚Äù They come looking for us because Mrs. Clinton kindly called attention to us by complaining about the Alt-Right and her ‚Äúbasket of deplorables.‚Äù I also try to explain that if the media had not launched its malicious campaign of trying to hold Donald Trump responsible for the views of certain people who support him, few people would have heard of the Alt-Right. In their zeal to paint their enemy in the darkest colors, they are promoting the Alt-Right, not Donald Trump. 
I explain that racial dissent has been growing like never before, for reasons that have nothing to do with the campaign. It is Trayvon Martin, Michael Brown, Black Lives Matters, and black rioters who are sending hundreds of thousands of frustrated white people our way‚Äì not Donald Trump. This will not change whether Mr. Trump wins or loses. The top landing pages on AmRen.com are analyses of race and crime‚Äìsomething Mr. Trump never talks about. 
I also explain to reporters that it is idiotic to think Mr. Trump has mainstreamed ‚Äúhate,‚Äù by which they mean sensible observations about race. I ask them to name a single person who has been ‚Äúemboldened‚Äù to say something ‚Äúracist‚Äù just because Donald Trump is the GOP nominee. Of course, they can‚Äôt. If anything, it is the opposite. Mr. Trump has been called every name under the sun for the mildest, most common-sense observations about Muslims and immigration. Anyone tempted to come out of the closet is likely to hesitate more than ever. Things could change if Mr. Trump becomes president, but the candidate himself has done very little to spread our ideas. 
What Donald Trump has done is spark an unprecedented interest in politics among disaffected young people who recognize that Mitt Romney and John McCain are no different from Barack Obama when it comes to preserving whites, their society, and their culture. I know a number of millennials who never bothered to vote before but who certainly will in November. I know some who have made their first political contribution or who have spent weekends volunteering for the Trump campaign. 
I point out to reporters that this is what elections are supposed to be all about: giving the voters real choices. I note that the Trump/Clinton contest will almost certainly produce a record voter turnout for a modern election. Haven‚Äôt our rulers been wringing their hands over a lack of political engagement, especially among the young? Well, now they have engagement, alright, but they don‚Äôt like it. They don‚Äôt like it because so many people are stumping for the candidate they love to call a ‚Äú threat to democracy .‚Äù Liberals are such transparent hypocrites. They claim to love democracy, but suddenly start worrying about its health if the people refuse vote the way they tell them to. 
The whole Trump-is-a-racist fracas shows just how painfully fragile orthodoxy has become. I may be wrong, but I have no reason to think Donald Trump thinks at all as we do. He has never said or done anything to suggest he is anything more than an ordinary American with normal instincts: He doesn‚Äôt want criminals sneaking across the border, he thinks sanctuary cities for illegals are crazy, he doesn‚Äôt see why we need more Muslims, and he is angry when immigrants go on welfare. Millions of ordinary Americans clearly agree with him, and not because they are racially aware. It is because they are decent, fair-minded people who also have a nagging sense that the country is changing in unwelcome ways. 
I am convinced that Mr. Trump does not have a sophisticated understanding of race. So far as I can tell, he doesn‚Äôt have a sophisticated understanding of much of anything. He has stumbled by instinct onto a few sensible policies that white advocates have been promoting for a long time, but not because he is one of us. 
Maybe‚Äìjust maybe‚Äìhe will move in our direction. It‚Äôs not impossible to imagine a President Trump asking, in an offhand way, ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs wrong with white people wanting to remain a majority in the United States?‚Äù Or he might casually note that you can‚Äôt expect as many blacks as Asians in AP classes because they don‚Äôt have the same levels of intelligence. But I can imagine the opposite, too: President Trump so bogged down in Beltway baloney that he never even builds the wall. 
There is one thing that Donald Trump has changed. He has proven that Republican bromides about taxes and small government don‚Äôt excite people. He has proven that there is tremendous anger against political insiders of both parties. He has proven that Americans do want their country to come first. They don‚Äôt want it to try to save the world or to be a dumping ground for people who have wrecked their own countries. 
And even if he has not ‚Äúmainstreamed racism,‚Äù he has shown that if you have a backbone you can withstand what is surely the most intense and concentrated program of hate ever directed at an American. On October 11, Roger Cohen wrote in the New York Times that Donald Trump is a ‚Äúphony, liar, blowhard, cheat, bully, misogynist, demagogue, predator, bigot, bore, egomaniac, racist, sexist, sociopath,‚Äù and a ‚Äúdictator-in-waiting with a brat‚Äôs temper and a prig‚Äôs scowl.‚Äù This must be one of the most unhinged, hysterical outbursts in the history of American political journalism. And it is unusual only for its wordiness, not its tone. 
Don‚Äôt the editors of the Times realize that this kind of frothing explains why more Americans believe in Bigfoot (29 percent) than trust newspapers (20 percent)? Virtually the entire industry is so consumed with rage at Donald Trump and contempt for his supporters that it cannot control itself. Open, petulant bias is driving more and more Americans to social media and to sites like AmRen.com for their news. 
Despite the concerted shrieking of virtually the entire American ruling class, Donald Trump is going to get close to half of the vote on November 8. Some 60 million people are going to vote for a man for whom Roger Cohen has emptied his dictionary trying to insult. Only one major newspaper has endorsed Donald Trump. Only one . And this is a man whom the American people might choose as their president. What better proof could we have of the stark difference between printed opinion and public opinion, between what Americans think and what our rulers want us to think? Donald Trump has ripped away whatever was left of the pretense of media objectivity. 
Whether he wins or not, whether he is one of us or not, Donald Trump has laid bare the collusion between big media and a political system in which both parties collaborate to run the country in their interests and those of their big donors. Voters‚Äìfinally‚Äìhave a chance to vote against the entire corrupt system. On November 8th they could bring it crashing down, but even if it still stands, it is visibly weakened, badly discredited. These are the perfect conditions in which our ideas will flourish as never before.",1

Some Cities Want Their Noncitizen Immigrants to Vote,"Some Cities Want Their Noncitizen Immigrants to Vote Caroline Winter, Bloomberg Businessweek, October 28, 2016 
‚ÄúLook at illegal immigrants voting all over the country,‚Äù Donald Trump recently claimed in a Fox News interview, part of his ongoing effort to cast doubt on the integrity of the presidential election. There‚Äôs no evidence to support the Republican nominee‚Äôs claims of election fraud, but some cities are moving to expand voting rights to include noncitizens. 
The latest is San Francisco, where the Nov. 8 ballot will include a measure allowing the parents or legal guardians of any student in the city‚Äôs public schools to vote in school board elections. The right would be extended to those with green cards, visas, or no documentation at all. ‚ÄúOne out of three kids in the San Francisco unified school system has a parent who is an immigrant, who is disenfranchised and doesn‚Äôt have a voice,‚Äù says San Francisco Assemblyman David Chiu, the son of Taiwanese immigrants. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôve had legal immigrants who‚Äôve had children go through the entire K-12 system without having a say.‚Äù Undocumented immigrants should also have the right, Chiu adds, to bypass the ‚Äúbroken immigration system in this country.‚Äù 
{snip} 
Today there are six jurisdictions in Maryland that let noncitizens vote in local elections. Chicago allows them to take part in elected parent advisory councils but not to vote in school board elections. Four towns in Massachusetts have moved to allow noncitizen voting and are awaiting state approval. And in New York City, where noncitizens make up 21 percent of the voting-age population, the city council is drafting legislation that would allow more than 1.3 million legal residents to take part in municipal elections. The city previously allowed noncitizens to vote in school board elections, but that ended when New York‚Äôs school boards were dissolved in 2002.

Illinois Sen. Mark Kirk is again under fire for making racially-charged comments, this time for questioning the military service of his Democratic opponent‚Äôs family. 
During Thursday night‚Äôs debate between Kirk and challenger Rep. Tammy Duckworth, Duckworth spoke about her desire to be in the Senate as a voice of reason and referenced her family‚Äôs history of service, saying, ‚ÄúMy family has served this nation in uniform, going back to the Revolution. I‚Äôm a daughter of the American Revolution. I‚Äôve bled for this nation. But I still want to be there in the Senate when the drums of war sound. Because people are quick to sound the drums of war, and I want to be there to say this is what it costs, this is what you‚Äôre asking us to do. . . . Families like mine are the ones that bleed first.‚Äù 
Kirk responded: ‚ÄúI had forgotten that your parents came all the way from Thailand to serve George Washington.‚Äù Tammy Duckworth is a vet who lost both legs in Iraq. Her family has served since the Revolutionary War. And yet‚Ä¶ pic.twitter.com/DHd3kWrUsN

Though Duckworth, who was born in Thailand to a Thai mother of Chinese descent and an American father, did not respond on the stage, she tweeted a photo after the debate of herself with her parents‚Äìher father displaying medals of service on his coat. ‚ÄúMy mom is an immigrant and my dad and his family have served this nation in uniform since the Revolution,‚Äù Duckworth wrote. 
Duckworth‚Äôs late father, Franklin, served in World War II and has ‚Äútraced his lineage back to an ancestor who fought in the American Revolution,‚Äù according to a 2012 Mother Jones profile on Duckworth‚Äôs run for Congress.

On Friday, Kirk tried to tamp down the backlash and tweeted ‚Äúsincere apologies to an American hero.‚Äù 
It‚Äôs not the first time the Illinois senator has courted controversy with racially-charged comments‚Äìhe previously said President Obama was ‚Äúacting like the drug dealer in chief‚Äù for the administration‚Äôs cash payment to Iran in exchange for the release of American prisoners, and talked about fostering opportunities for African-American entrepreneurs so ‚Äúthat the black community is not the one we drive faster through.‚Äù

"‚ÄòGo Back to Where You Claim Home,‚Äô Kansas Lawmaker Tells Protester","‚ÄòGo Back to Where You Claim Home,‚Äô Kansas Lawmaker Tells Protester Dion Lefler, Wichita Eagle, October 25, 2016 
Kansas state Rep. Joe Seiwert commented on Facebook that an African-American singer who knelt while performing ‚ÄúThe Star Spangled Banner‚Äù at a Miami Heat game should ‚Äúgo back‚Äù to where she claims as home. 
Seiwert, R-Pretty Prairie, posted that comment and a longer follow-up on an anti-black meme that was originally posted to a pro-Donald Trump Facebook group and then shared by one of Seiwert‚Äôs constituents. 
Seiwert confirmed the comments were his and said he was exercising his First Amendment right to free speech, as he says the woman in the meme did when she wore a Black Lives Matter T-shirt and knelt while singing the anthem. 
{snip} 
The photo in the meme is of Denasia Lawrence, a Miami social worker and, according to the Miami Sun-Sentinel, a part-time game-night employee of the Heat professional basketball team. The team has issued a statement saying team officials were unaware that Lawrence planned to protest when they asked her to sing the anthem at Friday‚Äôs preseason game with the Philadelphia 76ers. 
{snip} 
To which Seiwert responded: ‚ÄúI am where I claim home and like it, they want to claim it and it is their right to go where ever they like, so if they don‚Äôt like it here, I believe that their freedom completely allows them to go wherever they believe is more free and non racist if that‚Äôs what they believe.‚Äù 
Seiwert said he didn‚Äôt see the profanity in the meme when he commented and didn‚Äôt do anything wrong. 
‚ÄúI have a personal life besides a legislative life,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúMaybe it was inappropriate; I don‚Äôt believe so, because I said nothing derogatory. And I believe that (if) people are that upset with the national anthem, they can do whatever they want to on their own time, but when they‚Äôre using it on national TV to make a statement, that‚Äôs not right. 
‚ÄúI said if she (Lawrence) doesn‚Äôt like it here, then go where she would like it. What‚Äôs wrong with that?‚Äù he said. 
Asked why a person should leave rather than try to change things where they are, Seiwert responded: ‚ÄúBecause maybe there‚Äôs other people who don‚Äôt want their place changed.‚Äù 
He also said he did not think his comments had anything to do with race. 
‚ÄúIt don‚Äôt make any difference if they‚Äôre black, white or green, it‚Äôs the disrespect to our country,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúAnd why does everybody put the color to it?‚Äù 
{snip} 
The person who made the meme took a photo of Lawrence from the web and added, in capital letters, ‚ÄúKNEELING WHILE SINGING THE NATIONAL ANTHEM . . . I‚ÄôM SO SICK OF THESE ANTI-AMERICAN BLACKS . . . (Expletive) BLACK LIVES MATTER.‚Äù 
Seiwert‚Äôs comment, directed at Lawrence, was: ‚ÄúGo back to where you claim home than (sic).‚Äù

Rancher Yearns for Trump Wall on US-Mexico Border,"Rancher Yearns for Trump Wall on US-Mexico Border AFP, October 28, 2016 
To many, Donald Trump‚Äôs pledge to build a wall along the US-Mexico border is unrealistic. But for Jim Chilton, it‚Äôs the only way he‚Äôll get a good night‚Äôs sleep. 
The 77-year-old, a fifth-generation rancher on the Arizona border with Mexico, says he has grown weary of seeing drug smugglers‚Äìrather than just cattle‚Äìon his ranch and a wall is the answer to his troubles. 
‚ÄúI really admire Trump for having the insight and the knowledge to know what‚Äôs wrong with the current border system,‚Äù he said, as he surveyed the sprawling desert plains of his 75-square-mile ranch that stretches to the Mexican border. 
‚ÄúWe need a wall. I‚Äôve been saying that for 10 years . . . and we need roads along the boundary and the border patrol to be deployed there and not let anybody in,‚Äù he added. ‚ÄúIt would make my life so much better and I‚Äôd feel more secure.‚Äù 
{snip} 
Chilton, who admits that Trump was not his first choice among the Republican candidates for the White House, says building a barrier to secure the 2,000-mile (3,200-kilometer) US-Mexico frontier not only makes sense but is also a question of national security. 
{snip} 
‚ÄúI live in a no-man‚Äôs land. I live in a land that is occupied by the Sinaloa drug cartel,‚Äù he sighed, pointing to mountains on his ranch where he said scouts equipped with sophisticated equipment are posted as lookouts for smugglers. 
‚ÄúI have seen cartel scouts on these two mountains before . . . and even in my front yard,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúI wave at them and they often yell ‚Äòhola‚Äô and wave back.‚Äù 
Chilton‚Äìwho keeps a gun holstered on his hip, a rifle by his front door and a pistol by his bedside‚Äìadded that he and other ranchers are also in favor of beefed up security in remote border areas as extremist groups like Islamic State (IS) may be using them to slip operatives into the United States. 
{snip} 
But beyond the drug cartels and threat of terrorism, Chilton insists that Trump‚Äôs wall is all the more necessary for humanitarian reasons. 
‚ÄúIt‚Äôs just outrageous for me to find a dead body on my ranch. It‚Äôs outrageous for the border patrol to find a dead body and it‚Äôs outrageous for my cowboys,‚Äù he said, referring to migrants who often die making the crossing into the US through the brutal desert. 
‚ÄúThis is as big a humanitarian issue as it is a national security issue.‚Äù

According to the US Border Patrol, nearly 2,600 bodies have been recovered since 1998 from the desert in the Tucson, Arizona sector which covers 262 miles of the border.

49ers Fans Care More About Victories Than Kaepernick,"49ers Fans Care More About Victories Than Kaepernick Elliott Almond, Mercury News, October 24, 2016 
Colin Kaepernick‚Äôs first home start in a year didn‚Äôt stop the pessimism that has left red-jerseyed 49ers‚Äô patrons in a football funk. 
Thousands of empty red seats at Levi‚Äôs Stadium underscored San Francisco‚Äôs freefall that continued unabated Sunday in a 34-17 defeat to the Tampa Bay Buccaneers. 
Few were thinking about Kaepernick‚Äôs season-long activism in which he again kneeled during the national anthem to protest oppression against minorities. These days, fans just want to see their team win a game after six consecutive defeats. 
{snip} 
After leading the 49ers to a promising 14-0 first-quarter lead, Kaepernick and the offense sputtered. He completed just 16 of 34 passes for 134 yards with one touchdown and one interception. 
Kaepernick‚Äôs scrambling‚Äìhe led the team with 84 rushing yards on nine carries‚Äìand occasional flashes of accurate downfield passing, weren‚Äôt enough, even with the 49ers firmly in the game midway through the fourth quarter. 
{snip} 
Kaepernick donned a T-shirt Sunday paying tribute to the Black Panther Party, an Oakland activist group that celebrated its 50th anniversary this weekend. The quarterback said the shirt was a gift from his girlfriend, MTV host Nessa Diab. 
Last week, he wore a shirt with Muhammad Ali‚Äôs face before the game at Buffalo. 
Kaepernick‚Äôs protest against police shootings of unarmed African Americans has been divisive because some say it is disrespectful to veterans. A recent survey by Yahoo Sports and YouGov found that a decline in NFL ratings partially is attributed to the quarterback‚Äôs action. 
‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know much about ratings and how they are affected,‚Äù he said in a postgame interview. ‚ÄúBut I don‚Äôt understand why ratings would go down fighting for justice for people, to try to stop oppression, especially in the league that is predominately black.‚Äù

Dutch Anti-Islam MP Wilders to Snub Hate Speech Trial,"Dutch Anti-Islam MP Wilders to Snub Hate Speech Trial AFP, October 28, 2016 
Defiant Dutch anti-Islam politician Geert Wilders said Friday he will refuse to attend his hate speech trial next week, dubbing it a travesty aimed at silencing him as the country prepares for 2017 elections. 
The trial opens on Monday before a three-judge bench with the far-right politician facing charges of insulting a racial group and inciting racial hatred for comments he made about Moroccans living in the Netherlands. 
‚ÄúIt is my right and my duty as a politician to speak about the problems in our country,‚Äù Wilders said in a statement Friday, dubbing the case ‚Äúa political trial, in which I refuse to cooperate‚Äù. 
It comes as opinion polls have shown his far-right Freedom Party (PVV) doing well ahead of March elections. 
After riding high amid the migrant crisis, the party is now polling neck-and-neck with Prime Minister Mark Rutte‚Äôs Liberals each predicted to win between 25 to 29 seats in the 150-seat parliament. 
Set to last until November 25, the trial focuses on a comment made at a March 2014 rally when Wilders asked supporters if they wanted ‚Äúfewer or more Moroccans in your city and in the Netherlands?‚Äù 
When the crowd shouted back ‚ÄúFewer! Fewer!‚Äù Wilders answered: ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre going to organise that.‚Äù 
{snip} 
Wilders said Friday he would leave his defence in the hands of his lawyer Geert-Jan Knoops and instead ‚Äúgo to work‚Äù in the parliament in The Hague.

Judges earlier this month dismissed arguments by Wilders‚Äô lawyers that the trial was ‚Äúpolitically motivated‚Äù adding they did not believe it will impact the PVV‚Äôs election campaign. 
Politicians ‚Äúare granted broad freedoms of expression because of their official position,‚Äù the judges ruled last month. 
‚ÄúPrecisely therefore politicians have an important role to avoid feeding intolerance by making these kind of public statements.‚Äù 
Wilders hit back Friday saying ‚Äúit is a travesty that I have to stand trial because I spoke about fewer Moroccans.‚Äù 
‚ÄúMillions of Dutch citizens (43 percent of the population) want fewer Moroccans,‚Äù he claimed. 
‚ÄúNot because they despise all Moroccans or want all Moroccans out of the country, but because they are sick and tired of the nuisance and terror caused by so many Moroccans.‚Äù

More Migrants Pitch Tents on Paris Streets as Calais Camp Shuts,"More Migrants Pitch Tents on Paris Streets as Calais Camp Shuts Ingrid Melander, Reuters, October 28, 2016 
The number of migrants sleeping rough on the streets of Paris has risen by at least a third since the start of the week when the ‚ÄúJungle‚Äù shanty town in Calais was evacuated, officials said on Friday. 
Along the bustling boulevards and a canal in a northeastern corner of Paris, hundreds of tents have been pitched by migrants‚Äìmostly Africans who say they are from Sudan‚Äìwith cardboard on the ground to try and insulate them from the autumn chill. 
While the presence of migrants there is not new, it has grown substantially this week, Colombe Brossel, Paris deputy mayor in charge of security issues, told Reuters. 
‚ÄúWe have seen a big increase since the start of the week. Last night, our teams counted 40 to 50 new tents there in two days,‚Äù Brossel said, adding there was now a total of 700 to 750. 
This means there are some 2,000-2,500 sleeping in the area, up from around 1,500 a few days before, she said.

After years as serving as an illegal base camp for migrants trying to get to Britain, the ‚ÄúJungle‚Äù at Calais was finally bulldozed this week and the more than 6,000 residents of the ramshackle camp near the English channel were relocated to shelters around France.

"Canoes Reek of Genocide, Theft and White Privilege, Says Canadian Professor","Lukas Mikelionis, Heat Street, October 24, 2016 
{snip} According to Misao Dean, Professor of English at the University of Victoria, the canoe can be a symbol of colonialism, imperialism and genocide due to history. She also accused the canoers of cultural appropriation because they are primarily white men and have a privileged place in society. 
In a radio interview for CBC Radio , which wasn‚Äôt picked up by the Internet until several months later, she claimed ‚Äúwe have a whole set of narratives that make the canoe into a kind of morally untouchable symbol, something that seems natural, that seems ordinary, and seems to promote values that we ascribe to.‚Äù 
‚ÄúBut I think if you look a little further that narrative obscures or erases another narrative‚Äìand that narrative is about, to be blunt, it‚Äôs about theft and genocide‚Äù, the professor said.

CBC Radio host Jim Brown then asked a question: ‚ÄúShould we look at the canoe as a non-controversial symbol or should we look at it as a symbol of colonialism?‚Äù 
To which the academic replied: ‚ÄúAbsolutely a symbol of colonialism. It seems to me that this narrative we tell ourselves about the canoe about how canoeing makes us in touch with nature, how canoeing makes us in some way guiltless of the terrible things that the Canadian government and Canadians in general did to First Nations people.‚Äù

The Chinese Who Saw the Perils of Westernization,"Posted on October 28, 2016 The Chinese Who Saw the Perils of Westernization Sacco Vandal, American Renaissance, October 28, 2016 They cautioned their countrymen 100 years ago. 
Many Westerners fear the decline of their own society while they foresee Chinese ascension and impending dominance‚Äìwith alternating tones of fear or enthusiasm. The United States is growing demographically and may remain a viable cultural entity, but the consensus is that Europe faces demographic disaster. China and the West seem to be approaching an inversion of their relationship of just over a century ago, during the late Qing period, when the West was dominant and China was peripheral. [1] 
Patrick Buchanan described the Western dilemma in 2008: 
What happened to us? What happened to our world? When the twentieth century opened, the West was everywhere supreme. For four hundred years, explorers, missionaries, conquerors, and colonizers departed from Europe for the four corners of the Earth to erect empires that were to bring the blessings and benefits of Western civilization to all mankind. . . . Whatever became of those men? Somewhere in the last century, Western man suffered a catastrophic loss of faith‚Äìin himself, in his civilization, and in the faith that gave it birth. [2] 
Although the United States remains the strongest‚Äìbut not the sole‚Äìsuperpower, European peoples are in decline everywhere. In another book, Mr. Buchanan points out that ‚ÄúIn 1960, people of European ancestry were one-fourth of the world‚Äôs population; in 2000, they were one-sixth; in 2050, they will be one-tenth. These are the statistics of a vanishing race.‚Äù [3] Mr. Buchanan is hardly the first to warn of impending doom for the West. The lamentations of Oswald Spengler (1880‚Äì1936) are well known. Less known, however, are the Chinese from the same period who dreamed of a resurgence for China and warned of Western decline. These voices from the late Qing Dynasty may now seem prescient. 
Spengler saw the First World War as a sign of the West‚Äôs inevitable decline. Many of the Chinese literati who had at first been smitten with the dynamism of the West also came to see the war in the same way: Western civilization was in a state of crisis that would lead to its destruction. Today, Mr. Buchanan also calls the First World War a ‚Äúmortal wound‚Äù that was ‚Äúinflicted upon our civilization.‚Äù [4] Meanwhile, the Chinese, who have resurrected many of the tenets of their traditional civilization after decades of Maoist rule, argue that Western liberalization and democratization are not the True Way by which they will inherit the Earth. As China begins to return to traditional Chinese pragmatism and the West implodes, certain late Qing intellectuals now appear vindicated. Devastation after WWI. 
First among them were Yan Fu (1854‚Äì1921) and Liang Qichao (1873‚Äì1929). The dynamism of the West at first impressed them, leading them to promote Westernization in China. However, by the end of their lives, both men had come to see the dynamism of the West as self-destructive. They exhorted China to take a middle path between traditionalism and modernization, hoping that this might by the key to supplanting the West. 
China in trouble 
In the latter half of the 19th century, China was at a technological and military disadvantage. It lost a series of wars with Western powers and was forced to accept unequal treaties. This led various ministers of the Qing Dynasty, such as Li Hongzhang (1823‚Äì1901) to advocate mild forms of modernization. Meanwhile, the Meiji government in Japan had started an ambitious effort of full-scale Westernization beginning in 1868. And in 1895, after Japan defeated China in the Sino-Japanese War, it became obvious to most Chinese intellectuals that their nation‚Äôs program of limited modernization was not enough. 
Until the mid 19th century, Europe had been an inconsequential backwater for China. As late as 1793, a British attempt to establish a greater amount of trade with the Qing was rebuffed with the assertion by the Qianlong emperor (1711‚Äì1799) that China ‚Äúpossesses all things in prolific abundance and lacks no products within its own borders,‚Äù and thus had ‚Äúno need to import the manufactures of outside barbarians.‚Äù [5] By the mid 19th century, industrialization had made the West vastly more rich and powerful. However, some Chinese thought the sudden dynamism of the West also had intellectual origins. In the latter half of the nineteenth century, China found itself at the mercy of the Western powers that it once looked down upon. 
Darwin‚Äôs dangerous idea 
In 1895, Yan Fu was superintendent of the Beiyang Naval School. In an explanation of Western civilization to fellow Chinese intellectuals, he focused on the theory of evolution. As a young man, he had studied in England and become familiar with social Darwinism, and came to see it as the cultural fountainhead of wealth and power. ‚ÄúSince the publication of [Darwin‚Äôs The Origin of Species ],‚Äù wrote Yan, ‚Äúof which nearly every household in Europe and America now has a copy, there has been a tremendous change in the scholarship, politics, and religion of the West. The claim that the revolution in outlook and intellectual orientation occasioned by Darwin‚Äôs book exceeds that of Newtonian astronomy is hardly an empty one.‚Äù [6] Yan spent the next ten years translating works on English evolutionist thought by men such as Herbert Spencer (1820‚Äì1903) and Thomas Huxley (1825‚Äì1895) in the hope of converting his colleagues to social Darwinism. Yan Fu was attracted to social Darwinism while studying in England. 
Perhaps it took an outsider to see the power of evolutionary thought. Darwin‚Äôs theory shook Westerners but it also gave them a certain will to power. Herbert Spencer, who coined the term ‚Äúsurvival of the fittest,‚Äù led the transformation of Darwinism into social Darwinism, which called upon Western man to glorify victory in social competition. Victory in competition was the purpose of all life everywhere. 
Yan quickly saw the winning-at-all-costs ruthlessness of social Darwinism as a remedy for China. Writing in his work on Yan‚Äôs life, Benjamin Schwartz writes: 
What interests [Yan] is not so much the Darwinian account of biological evolution qua science. It is precisely the stress on the values of struggle‚Äìassertive energy, the emphasis on the actualization of potentialities within a competitive situation. The image of ‚Äònature red in tooth and claw‚Äô does not depress him. It exhilarates him. [7] 
Yan nevertheless worried that it might be too late for China to adopt social Darwinism, and that his country would be overwhelmed by the nations that had. In a 1895 newspaper essay, ‚ÄúOn Strength,‚Äù he wrote: 
Months and years slip by, and with rapacious neighbors all around, I fear that we will be too late, that we will follow Poland and India, providing an example of Darwin‚Äôs [elimination] before we have been able to implement Spencer‚Äôs methods. . . . Alas, our individual lives are not worth the worry, but what of our descendants, and the 400,000,000 of our race? [8] 
The battle for reform 
After defeat in the Sino-Japanese war, many Chinese intellectuals, such as Yan, began to advocate full-scale Westernization. Japan had already adopted social Darwinism in its pursuit of Western wealth and power, and the Chinese intelligentsia began to believe that China should follow suit. In 1898, the Guangxu emperor (1871‚Äì1908) appointed the minister Kang Youwei (1858‚Äì1927) to head a reform movement after Kang had requested permission to imitate Japan: 
As to the republican governments of the United States and France and the constitutional governments of Britain and Germany, these countries are far away and their customs are different from ours. Their changes occurred a long time ago and can no longer be traced. Consequently I beg Your Majesty. . . to take the Meiji Reform of Japan as the model for our reform. The time and place of Japan‚Äôs reform are not remote and her religion and customs are somewhat similar to ours. Her success is manifest; her example can easily be followed. [9] 
The emperor agreed, and the minister initiated a flurry of Meiji-style reform. A bright young man named Liang Qichao worked with Kang as his prot√©g√©, and he became one of the most influential Chinese advocates for Westernization. However, Kang and Liang‚Äôs efforts were quickly aborted after an imperial coup under the Empress Dowager Cixi (1835‚Äì1908). Liang Qichao 
After the Empress Dowager cut short what later became known as the Hundred Days Reform, Kang and Liang escaped political persecution by fleeing to Japan. Once there, Kang continued to support the Qing dynasty and to justify an agenda for Chinese reform via cautious appeals to Confucianism. Liang, however, ultimately broke with Kang and‚Äìlike Yan‚Äìbegan to espouse ‚Äúa new view of world history strongly colored by social Darwinism: a struggle for survival among nations and races.‚Äù [10] 
He wrote: 
If we wish to make our nation strong, we must investigate extensively the methods followed by other nations in becoming independent. We should select the superior points and appropriate them to make up for our own shortcomings. [11] 
Liang increasingly came to see social Darwinism as the fuel of the West‚Äôs dynamism, one of the ‚Äúsuperior points‚Äù that China would do well to ‚Äúappropriate.‚Äù Writing from Japan, he exerted great influence on young Chinese. Together, Yan and Liang instilled in an entire generation of Chinese students a fervent desire for change. But this influence did not bring social Darwinism to China. Instead, it brought the 1911 Revolution, the New Cultural Movement (1915‚Äì1921), and the May Fourth Movement of 1919‚Äìperturbations that would spin China into over half a century of upheaval. 
Accommodative versus transformative thought 
Despite their attraction to social Darwinism and their sometimes radical calls for reform, Yan and Liang were not revolutionaries. Indeed, although Liang and‚Äìespecially‚ÄìYan attacked various instances of Chinese backwardness, they continued to support the Qing Dynasty, advocating slow transition into a constitutional monarchy based on the British model. Once the 1911 Revolution succeeded, however, Liang grudgingly threw his support behind the new republican government, but Yan continued to support monarchy. 
Questioning the West 
The First World War was a shock to reformers who wanted to embrace the West. As the war dragged on, aging reformers such as Yan and Liang became increasingly disillusioned with not only transformative revolution, but Westernization and even the West. Yan wrote that the carnage of the war was a consequence of Western traits: ‚ÄúSuch has been the effect on the human race of civilization and science! When I look back on our [Chinese] sacred wisdom and culture, I find that it foresaw this even at that early date. . .‚Äù [12] 
Yan explained further: 
As I have grown older and have observed the seven years of republican government in China and the four years of bloody war in Europe‚Äìa war such as the world has never known‚ÄìI have come to feel that [the West‚Äôs] progress . . . has lead only to selfishness, slaughter, corruption, and shamelessness. When I look back upon the ways of Confucius and Mencius, I find that they . . . have profoundly benefited the realm. This is not my opinion alone. Many thinking people in the West have gradually come to feel this way. [13] 
Liang wrote that ‚Äúrecently many Western scholars have wanted to import Asian civilization as a corrective to their own,‚Äù and, indeed, the latter half of the 20th century saw the importation of philosophical, religious, and cultural curiosities from the East and into the West. In the meantime he stated his goal for China: 
I therefore hope that our dear young people will, first of all, have a sincere purpose of respecting and protecting our civilization; second, that they will apply Western methods to the study of our civilization and discover its true character; third, that they will put our own civilization in order and supplement it with others‚Äô so that it will be transformed and become a new civilization; and fourth, that they will extend this new civilization to the outside world so that it can benefit the whole human race. [14] 
Because of the devastation of the First World War, these two thinkers who had once promoted modernization and Westernization instead advocated a modernization without Westernization (or at least minimal Westernization). They seemed to believe that the course of the West was not sustainable and that the West could be supplanted by China if it modernized in a way that was compatible with its nature and culture. They seem to have realized that social Darwinism was a false promise, and that the forces it unleashed could destroy the West. 
China and the West today 
In the end, China did not follow Japan down the path of Westernization. A burgeoning Chinese nationalism grew up around anti-Japanese sentiment, and this enmity was extended to the West after Japan instead of China was awarded Germany‚Äôs Chinese concession at Versailles in 1919. Ultimately, communism on the Soviet model provided the Chinese with an alternative to both Chinese traditionalism and the West. China entered a period of socialist tyranny under Mao Zedong (1893‚Äì1976). 
After Mao‚Äôs death, China began to abandon Maoism. It is still nominally communist, but since the 1980‚Äôs, it has followed the example of Hong Kong and Taiwan and has increasingly returned to the teachings of Confucius and Mencius. Chinese now praise Yan and Liang for their wisdom and prescience. The post-Mao leadership of the People‚Äôs Republic of China‚Äìbeginning with Deng Xiaoping‚Äìhas espoused views nearly identical to those advocated by Liang over a century ago. [15] Statue of Liang Qichao in Tianjin. 
At the same time, Westerners are now studying the warnings of Yan and Liang about the inherent instability of the West. As Western liberals such as Martin Jacques herald the coming Chinese domination, there may be a generation of European and American scholars who find themselves in a position similar to that of Yan and Liang: struggling to understand why their civilization has fallen behind that of a rival whose inferiority was once taken for granted. 
Thus, while China has found its way back to the middle path, balancing its modernization and Westernization with pragmatism, caution, and Confucianism, the West is disintegrating in a chaos of heterogeneity and decadence. The warnings of Spengler have come true, and Patrick Buchanan forecasts the death of the West. Russia and parts of Eastern Europe are trying to save themselves from liberalism and democracy, but success is not guaranteed. 
Thinkers in the Alt-Right are wrestling with the question of how to save our own white civilization. The old order is collapsing due to challenges from abroad and the immigrant invasion. Non-whites are chopping up the West the way the West once chopped up China. We are Yan Fu and Liang Qichao. We must forge a plan for the preservation of our race.

War With the Comanche,"War With the Comanche Duncan Hengest, American Renaissance, July 2010 
Fort Sill, north of Lawton, Oklahoma, is home to the Army‚Äôs Field Artillery School as well as many field artillery brigades. Over the decades, thousands of Americans have learned how to crew cannon there, and I am one of them. A posting to Fort Sill allowed me to explore what remains of the Wild West when I was off duty. I‚Äôd always been a fan of Westerns and of the real history of America‚Äôs pioneering conquest of the continent, and the Lawton area was and is the center of Comanche territory. 
During the early days of the Texas Republic, the Comanche were the world‚Äôs best light cavalry. In fact, they were such fantastic fighters that the Spanish never even tried to subdue them, and the Comanche halted the expansion of settlements into the panhandle and northern Texas for nearly 50 years. Yet the Comanche today are a pitiful group, the defeated remnants of a terrible racial conflict. 
Everywhere you go in Lawton, you see obese Indians. In Oklahoma each tribe has its own license plates, so you can tell a person‚Äôs tribe by watching him get into his car. (I tried to get a license plate that said ‚ÄúComanche‚Äù but the DMV would not give me one.) Sometimes it seems as though all the Comanche are unhealthy; the white man‚Äôs diet does not seem suited to a people adapted to living on game from the North American prairie. When the Comanche get sick they go to the Public Health Service Indian Hospital at the eastern end of Lawton. If you drive by you are likely to see ancient Indians ‚Äî poor and disheveled ‚Äî holding out their thumbs for a ride. Their hands tremble. 
It seems that the Comanche are as badly adapted to the white man‚Äôs economy as to his diet. I once watched a heavy Comanche woman slowly pushing pennies towards a white cashier. She carefully slid each coin across the counter as though it was very difficult to part with. 
The Comanche‚Äôs misery is the result of their absolute defeat during a fierce conflict with whites in the 19th Century. The Comanche War, as that conflict has come to be known, was lengthy and cruel. This terrible war that cursed both the Indians and the Americans was largely inherent in their circumstances; different races and cultures, especially aggressive ones, should not try to share the same territory. 
Always against us 
The name Comanche is a Spanish corruption of the Ute word Kohmahts , meaning enemy, stranger, or those who are always against us. Like many tribes, the Comanche called themselves simply ‚Äúthe people,‚Äù or Numunuh in their own language. They are an offshoot of the Shoshone, who hail from the area of today‚Äôs southern Idaho. Sometime during the 1500s, they left the mountain northwest and settled in southwest Oklahoma. There, they acquired horses from the Spanish, and began to dominate the high plains of western Oklahoma, the Texas Panhandle, and Eastern New Mexico. This vast territory was well watered and its grasslands fed the Comanche‚Äôs horses, endless herds of buffalo, and other smaller game. With the horse, the Comanche could travel rapidly on the planes, and easily kill buffalo. 
In the mountain Northwest, the Comanche had been a poor, foot-bound people; with the horse they became lords of the western plains. Their population exploded. There was no census, but estimates of their numbers vary from 10 to 30 thousand. As they grew more powerful, they started raiding their neighbors. They raided the Apache and Pueblo in Arizona and New Mexico, and the Pawnee in Eastern Kansas. They traded with the Spaniards around Santa Fe but also raided settlements in Mexico and Texas. They often took captives in Mexico and ransomed them back to traders in Santa Fe for finished goods. Neither the Spanish Empire nor the Mexican Republic had the means to stop this well-organized piracy. 
Despite constant raiding, some time around 1790 the Comanche made a lasting alliance with the Kiowa. Like the Comanche, the Kiowa had come from the mountain Northwest, moved into the southern plains, and acquired the horse. The Kiowa and Comanche spoke different languages, but lived in a very similar manner. The Kiowa were a much smaller tribe, and perhaps they fitted into a special niche: not worth raiding and too small to be a threat, but useful allies. This alliance between two extremely warlike people held year after year. The two tribes raided together so consistently that Comanche raids were often Comanche-and-Kiowa raids. 
The Comanche came to the attention of Americans when Texas became free of Mexico. Shortly after independence, in 1838, the new republic signed its first peace treaty with the Comanche ‚Äî a treaty that was probably doomed from the start. It was made with only one Comanche band, it did not define a boundary between Texas and Comanche lands, and it was never ratified by the Texas Senate. Essentially it required that the Comanche stop attacking whites ‚Äî a not unreasonable demand ‚Äî and some Comanche may have intended to abide by it. However, the Republic of Texas was a young, independent state with relatively wealthy white newcomers living in isolated settlements. They were irresistible targets for raiders, and the treaty was soon broken. 
Comanche raids were striking examples of military precision and stealth. Raiding parties could number up to 1,500, and could move undetected across the grassland. Attacks on this scale had proven brilliantly successful against traditional Comanche targets: larger villages of mostly unarmed Mexicans or other Indians. These villages had no way to fight off the Comanche or pursue them as they retreated. 
Raiders were most active during the full moon, when they could see at night. The waxing of the moon became a source of dread for Texas whites, who began to call the full moon a ‚ÄúComanche moon.‚Äù When they sacked Texas farmhouses they usually killed the men and captured the youngsters and women. Comanche women often tortured and mutilated older girls and women to make them less attractive. The women also took the lead in torturing men. They might cut the skin off their feet, tie them to a horse, and make them walk behind until they collapsed and were dragged to death. 
By 1840, just two years after the treaty, relations between whites and Comanche were murderous and getting worse by the day. In March, the Texas government sent Colonel Henry W. Karnes at the head of a group to meet a delegation of Comanche chiefs at the San Antonio Council House. Karnes was charged with recovering Texas captives and trying to improve relations. The Texans estimated that the Comanche held some 200 captives, and promised that their return would be taken as a gesture of goodwill. 
The meeting went badly. The Comanche arrived with only one of the promised captives, a young girl whose nose had been burned off. She was badly bruised from beatings, and said she had been repeatedly gang-raped. Texan soldiers, who were already angry over the raids and the broken treaty, killed the chiefs outright. Other whites opened fire on the Comanche who were outside the courthouse. 
To the Comanche, the Council House slaughter was treachery of the lowest sort. What the Texans considered savagery ‚Äî raiding, torture, and slaughter of captives ‚Äî were to them the normal practices of war. From this mutual incomprehension, and from the slaughter of the chiefs, the seeds of long-term hatred were planted. The Comanche never forgave the Texans. Throughout the decades they were pillaging Texas, Comanche could have raided Kansas ‚Äî it was no farther away than many parts of Texas ‚Äî but they saved their wrath for Texas. 
The Comanche did not wait long for revenge. In early August they launched a massive attack on the coastal towns of Victoria and Linnville. In Victoria, the local militia, often called ‚ÄúMinutemen,‚Äù managed to drive off the attackers. They fired from inside buildings, and the Comanche, unused to city fighting, retreated. At Linnville, the raiders killed some 20 residents; the others survived only by boarding ships and moving just off shore, where they watched as the Comanche burned the town to the ground. Linnville never rebuilt, and the area is now a residential part of Calhoun County. 
Linnville and Victoria are hundreds of miles from the center of Comanche territory in Oklahoma, and the attacks demonstrate the extraordinary reach and mobility the raiders enjoyed. At that time, the Comanche often hunted and camped in territory as far south as Austin. The barbed wire fence had yet to be invented, so there was little to stop them. Indeed, Texans had settled only the eastern and coastal parts of the state, so the coast was well within range of inland tribes. 
The warfare that began with the council house killings and the revenge raids on Linnville and Victoria lasted until the late 1870s, and this nearly 40-year war can be divided into three stages. The first, which lasted until Texas joined the Union in 1845, pitted the Comanche against locally-organized whites supported by a Texas government that was highly sympathetic to them. The second, from 1845 until 1861, was much like the Cold War in that the federal government contained the Comanche but did not destroy their ability to make war. In the last stage of the conflict, after the Civil War, a vindictive Reconstruction government ignored bloody and repeated Comanche attacks on disarmed whites and supported the Comanche through a myriad of welfare and reform policies. Only after the post-Civil War elite was directly threatened did it take action, permanently ending the Comanche threat in 1879. 
Texans strike back 
Immediately after the great raids on Linnville and Victoria, the Texans called out the militia and assembled Ranger companies, and defeated the retreating Comanche force at the Battle of Plum Creek on August 14, 1840. The Comanche were slowed by the burden of their loot from Linnville, and also faced an enemy that was better armed and organized than their earlier Indian and Mexican antagonists. Since the 1830s, Texas Rangers had carried six-shooter revolvers as well as long rifles. The Comanche were still mostly armed with bows and arrows as well as lances, and usually retreated on their fast horses in the face of sustained gunfire. When the mounted Rangers could catch them, they would ride next to the Indians and inflict terrible losses with their six-shooters. 
Another important ingredient in subsequent successes against the Comanche was the leadership of the dynamic and aggressive Texas president, Mirabeau Buonaparte Lamar. Lamar was a Georgian who had moved to Texas to escape disappointments in his career and personal life. He fought at the Battle of San Jacinto, where the Mexican Army was defeated and Texas won independence. The Texas constitution allowed for a single presidential term in office, and Lamar was elected to succeed Sam Houston. One of the new president‚Äôs first challenges was the Comanche. As he put it, ‚ÄúThe fierce and perfidious savages are waging upon our exposed and defenseless inhabitants, an un-provoked and cruel warfare, masacreing [sic] the women and children, and threatening the whole line of our unprotected borders with speedy desolation.‚Äù 
After the victory at Plum Creek, Lamar began a policy of retaliatory raids on villages in the Comanche sanctuary in the Texas Panhandle and Oklahoma. Colonel John H. Moore, accompanied by Lipan Indian scouts, led the initial foray. The Rangers moved on an area that is now Colorado City, Texas, and the Lipans discovered a village with little security. Moore sent a detachment to cover a likely escape route, and ordered the main body of his command to attack. He caught the Comanche by surprise and killed 50 in the village. The ambush detachment killed another 80 retreating Indians. The killing was somewhat indiscriminate and included women and children. Moore‚Äôs tactics of attack and ambush were duplicated by the Rangers, and later, by the US cavalry. 
(Interestingly, this was the same basic plan George Custer used at Little Big Horn in 1876. The difference was that the Sioux village was massive. The Indians also had lever-action rifles and pinned down the ambush detachment while sending a larger force to overwhelm the 7th Cavalry‚Äôs main attack. Custer never had a chance.) 
Lamar saw the conflict as a race war, and made no secret of his desire to rid the state of all Indian tribes. He probably would have exterminated the Comanche if he could have, but took different measures against less war-like tribes. His administration pointedly sent no aid when diseases swept through Indian territory. He began the process that moved the Cherokee, Caddo, and Tonkowa onto reservations in Oklahoma, but once they were settled peacefully, he never harried them. 
Against the Comanche, Lamar developed both defensive and offensive strategies. The Rangers‚Äô ability to defeat large groups prevented the Comanche from forming large raiding parties, and the Minutemen in the Texas settlements ‚Äî almost like local crime watches ‚Äî defended against smaller raids. The system was not perfect, but the raids became smaller and less frequent. Rangers also continued to maul Comanche villages. As T. R. Fehrenbach wrote in his definitive Comanche: A History of a People , there were many retaliatory actions ‚Äúno one bothered to report.‚Äù 
Part of the tragedy of the war is that although the Comanche had raided for generations, they had never faced an opponent like the Texans and did not understand them. Spaniards and Mexicans were disorganized prey, and could not mount a full-scale defense. Nor did they have a militia to call out. The Comanche assumed that white men were like themselves, loosely organized bands for whom an offence against one was not an insult to all. Texans saw things differently, and united against what they considered a threat to the entire state. 
Until they took on the Texans, the Comanche had always been safe from reprisal raids, so for them, the war was over when the raiding party came home. The Texans were different. Months after a raid, they would surprise an offending ‚Äî or completely innocent ‚Äî Comanche village and put it to the torch. Also, Comanche movements were limited by the seasons and buffalo hunts, whereas the Texans could campaign any time of year. By the end of Lamar‚Äôs administration a generation of Comanche warriors was dead. T.R. Fehrenbach estimates that from 1838 to 1840, a quarter of the braves had been killed, most of them in the actions following the Council House fight. 
What saved the Comanche and kept the war alive were larger questions of geopolitics. The Texans were going broke. The country‚Äôs finances were unsound, and the Comanche campaign was just one of several conflicts Lamar had to finance. There were constant Mexican incursions, and Lamar even sent troops into Mexico at great expense. The United States was receptive to annexation, so Texas joined the Union in 1845. The expensive Ranger companies were cut back and federal troops took over their job. At first, the Army sent only infantry to forts along the frontier, and they could not stop the Comanche from moving freely over the prairies. Secretary of War Jefferson Davis formed a cavalry regiment to send to Texas, which managed to prevent some raiding. Its efforts were helped by a cholera epidemic the ‚ÄúForty-niners‚Äù brought when they crossed the plains during the Gold Rush. It is estimated that the Comanche population dropped from 20,000 to 12,000 during this time. 
Whites began to push the internal Texas frontier forward. The east and south were settled by then, but the north and west ‚Äî where Wichita Falls and Amarillo are today ‚Äî were still raw frontier. With the Comanche more or less under control, white settlers began to fill the empty parts of the state. 
By 1860, the Comanche were on the defensive ‚Äî reduced by plague and harried by the US Cavalry. Their final defeat would have been just a matter of time, but the Civil War changed the balance of power. The federal troops left, and Confederate forces went East. The pressure lifted, and midway through the war the Comanche started raiding again. They went back to their old ways of rape, plunder, and torture, but with a new twist. They soon found they could steal Texas cattle and trade them with Comancheros ‚Äî Hispanic traders in the Rio Grande Valley ‚Äî for lever-action rifles. The Texans lost the advantage in firepower they had always enjoyed. The Comanche had always been able to get a few modern weapons, but massive industrial production and increasing trade made them much easier to get. 
The Texas Reconstruction government therefore inherited a new Comanche war that was blowing with a terrible fury, but did not take it seriously. The carpetbag elite was less interested in fighting Indians than in enriching itself at local expense and supporting the newly freed blacks. Things only got worse as the 1860s wore on, and T.R. Fehrenbach writes that by 1870, ‚Äúlong-settled regions were regressing toward depopulation. Only hundreds of settlers were being killed, but meanwhile thousands were deserting the frontier. The panic was very real.‚Äù The frontier retreated ‚Äî an early form of white flight ‚Äî as farmers left their properties for safer areas. Those who stayed behind turned their haciendas into fortresses. The effect was to hold back growth; the panhandle could not be settled until the 1880s. Lyndon Baines Johnson‚Äôs ancestors were among those the Comanche harried. 
Even as the Comanche were murdering white homesteaders, the government attempted a sanctuary, welfare buy-off, faith-based assimilation program that is reminiscent of modern times. During the final Comanche War from 1865 to 1879, Texas whites were disarmed by the Reconstruction government, and prevented by law from retaliatory raiding into Comanche territory. They could do little more than lobby a hostile occupation government for aid ‚Äî not always to much effect. Pro-Indian liberals in government as well as East Coast sentimentalists even prevented several murderous Indian chiefs from being hanged. Ironically, the attack those chiefs led was the very incident that caused the Army and federal government finally to act decisively. 
More humane policy 
One of the causes of federal inaction was a genuine desire to handle Indian troubles in a humane way. East of the Mississippi, Indian wars had been bloody affairs that ended with the Indians absolutely destroyed or confined. If anything, Northerners were slightly more violent than Southerners. Yankees tended to wipe out Indians and remove any survivors to small, out of-the-way reservations. In upstate New York, the Continental Army destroyed more than 40 Iroquois villages and left survivors to starve or seek aid from the British. In 1794 at the Battle of Fallen Timbers, American troops defeated an Indian force and then removed all remaining Indians from Ohio. After victories in the Midwest, whites paid the surviving Indians paltry sums for their land and sent them West with essentially no support. Abraham Lincoln‚Äôs sole experience as a soldier was a brief period of garrison duty with the Illinois Militia in the otherwise bloody Blackhawk War, in which the Sac and Fox Indians were destroyed and forced out of Illinois and Wisconsin. 
In the South, the Cherokee were the source of the longest-running conflict, and held lands in Georgia long after the northeastern states had destroyed their Indians. As tensions with whites mounted, relocation became the favored solution rather than war and ad hoc expulsion, and was carried out mainly though an admittedly one-sided legal process. Cherokee removal was a relatively peaceful and fair solution to two incompatible peoples living close to each other with a long history of violence. Stand Watie, a Cherokee chief who later became a Confederate general, supported the move from Georgia to Oklahoma, and brought his band West well before the now-notorious ‚ÄúTrail of Tears.‚Äù 
In that context it is understandable that after the Civil War, many pressure groups in the East, no longer threatened by Indians, pushed for more peaceful measures. Also backing the changes was the Office of Indian Affairs, which wanted more control over Indians at the expense of the Army. President Grant therefore tried to treat Indians as wards of government rather than independent nations, and to assimilate and civilize them rather than destroy them. 
In the past, Indian wars were often sparked when a dishonest Indian Agent stole government aid to the Indians for his own profit, so in 1869, Grant charged religious groups with carrying out his new policy of turning Indians into peaceful farmers. The denomination that got the Comanche assignment was the Society of Friends, or Quakers. Quakers are one of America‚Äôs oldest and most influential founding groups. They live a life of piety and thrift, and disavow fancy dress and military action, but it may have been a mistake to pick a group religiously opposed to war in any form. 
President Grant‚Äôs agent to the Comanche was Lawrie Tatum of Iowa, who had probably never seen an Indian before he answered his Church‚Äôs call and headed West. Tatum arrived at Fort Sill in 1869 and enacted a sort of Great Society program. He started schools, gave deeds of farmland to the Comanche with instructions for farming, and established a mill for grinding grain. The Comanche also got free coffee, sugar, and blankets, and lived in safety. Soldiers secured Fort Sill and the agent‚Äôs supplies, but did not interfere with Comanche activity or take to the field. Quakers would not use the military to keep the Comanche on their reservation and avoid war. 
Tatum worked hard to teach the Comanche to be civilized farmers but was defeated by circumstances. The Comanche culture‚Äôs central focus was on warfare and raiding. Wealth and status could only be acquired through war, and Quaker pacifism was too foreign to graft onto their way of life. Also, welfare handouts are always unsatisfying. The Comanche were not happy with reservation rations and it was far more rewarding to plunder Texans. The Fort Sill Reservation became a sanctuary from which they could wage war. In 1871 there were even scalpings within a short distance of Army posts. Whites had sent a capable and honest agent to deal with the Comanche and bring about peace, but the Comanche were not willing to be peaceful. 
Sherman and the Comanche 
Just as it is today, it was whites who lived furthest from the menace who were convinced they knew best how to handle it. In Philadelphia or New York it was easy to talk about humane Indian policies, but on the frontier, whether in Confederate or Yankee territory, sentiments were different. In Minnesota in 1862, Sioux Indians attacked whites, killing hundreds. Many whites were fresh from northern Europe or descended from the very liberal Puritan and Quaker colonists. Yet they rallied and pushed the Sioux out of the state. 
In Colorado in 1864, Methodist minister and volunteer army officer John Chivington, a fervent abolitionist, led a force of mostly settler militia against a group of Cheyenne after a series of murderous raids. His militia massacred Indians without compunction but his force also included a few regulars from the East who were appalled by the killing and raised a stink. Chivington also made a bad mistake: He attacked a peaceful band of Indians, not the hostile Dog Soldiers, an out-of-control offshoot of the Cheyenne, who were actually doing the raiding. 
Also in 1864 an Army unit under Kit Carson fought the Comanche at the Battle of Adobe Walls, in Hutchinson County, Texas. The Indians surrounded the force but were held off with two mountain howitzers. The cannon were decisive. Carson‚Äôs men were outnumbered nearly ten to one, but killed nearly 100 Indians for a loss of six whites. 
Texans therefore eventually got help from people who knew Indians first hand. Help arrived, ironically, in the form of William T. Sherman, who never had much faith in Grant‚Äôs Indian policy. In 1871 he toured Texas to inspect damage from Comanche raids, and had a near encounter with Indians that had an effect on policy. A group of braves led by Set-tainte, Set-tank, and Big Tree attacked a wagon convoy of Army supplies that passed just minutes behind Sherman‚Äôs lightly guarded inspection tour. The dozen men on the convoy fought back, but seven were killed, scalped, and mutilated. One man died after being tied upside down to a wagon wheel with a fire set under his head. 
Sherman was shaken by this close call, and sent out the cavalry under Colonel Ranald S. Mackenzie to investigate. With information from Agent Tatum, Mackenzie cornered the three ringleaders. Set-tank died resisting arrest, but the other two were sent back to Texas for trial. 
Set-tainte and Big Tree were sentenced to death, but not executed. The trial became a circus, with the two Indians at the center of a political struggle they must have found bewildering. As T.R Fehrenbach explains, ‚ÄúThere was much popular sentiment in the East against hanging the aborigines; more important, the Indian Bureau and Department of the Interior strongly resented the army‚Äôs interference in Indian affairs.‚Äù President Grant wired the Reconstruction governor Edmond J. Davis and asked him to commute the sentences to life in prison. Davis did so. Eventually the two were released after serving less than a year. Texans were outraged. Even Quaker Tatum, who by this time was thoroughly disillusioned with the peace policy, was indignant. 
Although President Grant had pushed for a pardon, he reconsidered the peace policy and quietly let Colonel Mackenzie take the field. Mackenzie brought along Gatling guns, which gave his men a real edge over larger forces. (Rapid-fire weapons were rarely used against mass charges of Indians ‚Äî they were too smart to try that ‚Äî but having them meant Mackenzie‚Äôs men rarely had to face such charges. Things might have turned out differently for Custer if he had taken Gatling guns.) 
Mackenzie drove ruthlessly into Comanche territory. He was a hard man, who pursued Indians wherever they fled ‚Äî even into Mexico ‚Äî and his men certainly killed women and children. One of his harshest tactics was to capture any Indians he could ‚Äî women, children, elders ‚Äî and hold them hostage. This meant Comanche war parties were forced to move with their entire villages, lest their families wind up in prison camp or dead from a trigger-happy trooper. The Comanche had even more to fear from the militia. Local men who may have known people killed in raids were invariably more vengeful than professional soldiers. 
This policy of interning non-combatant Indians was part of one of the last full-scale campaigns against the Comanche, starting in August 1874, when Mackenzie pursued a force led by Chief Quanah Parker into the Llano Estacado of the Southern Plains. In late September, Mackenzie‚Äôs men captured a New Mexican Comanchero trader and made him talk by stretching him over a wagon wheel. He revealed the location of a large Comanche village in a canyon. Mackenzie‚Äôs men rode all night and stormed the canyon, capturing the horses, food stores, and teepees. The braves, always excellent fighters, held off the army until the women and children climbed out of the canyon, but Mackenzie burned their supplies and killed their horses. Over the next several days, he pursued and defeated the hungry, foot-bound Comanche. Many braves surrendered and returned to the reservation. 
These tactics greatly reduced the Indian menace by the end of 1875, but the Comanche faced yet another threat. The expanding railroads brought whites armed with new buffalo guns onto the prairie to hunt the buffalo for their skins. The result was a slaughter that nearly wiped out the great herds on which the Comanche had depended for generations. The hunters themselves were dangerous; one group defeated a larger force of Comanche with their excellent rifles in 1874, at the Second Battle of Adobe Walls. Constantly pursued by the Army, starving for want of game, by 1879 the Comanche were a beaten people and never again threatened Texas. From a possible high of 30,000 at the start of the 19th century, the Comanche were reduced to roughly 1,500 by 1878. A once-proud people finally submitted permanently to the reservation. 
The Comanche War is now history, its many tales preserved in movies and books. No Texan now living ever feared a Comanche moon. Today, tribal conflict takes different forms, and it is incursions from the South that are pushing back the white frontier. Clashes are not so sharp as those in the 19th century, but the outcome is no different. The destiny of Texas is being decided through immigration and demographics rather than armed conflict, but the questions remain the same: who will populate and who will rule? Earlier Americans understood what was at stake; today‚Äôs Americans have been numbed into acquiescence.",1

‚ÄúBirth of a Nation‚Äù Bombs,"Posted on October 31, 2016 ‚ÄúBirth of a Nation‚Äù Bombs Chris Roberts, American Renaissance, October 29, 2016 Are whites fed up with white-guilt films? 
The results are in: The new Birth of a Nation is a box-office disaster. Its ticket sales are going to fall several millions of dollars short of the cost to make and market the film‚Äìmaybe as much as ten million dollars short . This is excellent news for white America. Birth of Nation glorifies black-on-white violence at a time when black-on-white violence is on the rise , and the anti-white vitriol from groups like Black Lives Matter has never been more mainstream . 
The financial failure of Birth of a Nation is even better news when you consider the success of other recent films that cultivate white guilt and glorify black violence. In 2012, Django Unchained , another story of a black slave killing white southerners, made well over 150 percent of its production costs. In 2013, Twelve Years a Slave nearly tripled its production costs, and The Butler , the story of a sad black servant in the White House, did even better. 
Have American moviegoers lost interest in movies that tell them to feel guilty about their history? If so, the reason must surely be the rising disgust among whites at always being cast as the villains of history, and I suspect Donald Trump has had something to do with this. Win or lose, Mr. Trump has sparked a sense of pride in whites, and that affects many things, including movie-going habits. 
Think back to 2012 and 2013, when anti-white films were box office bonanzas. That 24-month period may well have been the lowest point for whites in American history. Politically, the implicitly white Tea Party movement disintegrated, and Mitt Romney lost to Barack Obama despite winning as much of the white vote as Ronald Reagan had decades earlier. Meanwhile, the number of journalists and commentators being purged for ‚Äúracism‚Äù was higher than ever: John Derbyshire, Jason Richwine, Robert Weissberg, Jack Hunter, Frank Borzellieri, Pat Buchanan, Leif Parsell, Peter Brimelow, Paul Gottfried, and Thomas Bertonneau all lost jobs. 
The white world outside of politics was not looking good either. The catastrophic waste of our wars in the Middle East had become obvious to anyone. Perhaps not by coincidence, the heroin epidemic in New England was starting and the white suicide rate was rising. The university system was becoming more and more aggressive with its theories of ‚Äúwhite privilege,‚Äù microaggressions, and gender fluidity‚Äìand there seemed to be no one fighting back. The longstanding trends of black dominance in music and sports continued, and America seemed on its way to becoming this hemisphere‚Äôs South Africa . 
In such a world, why not laugh along with black actor Jamie Foxx when he joked about enjoying killing all the white people in Django Unchained ? When the theory of ‚Äúwhite privilege‚Äù is all but doctrine, blockbusters naturally vilify whites. 
People often make their conditions worse. Frustrated young men often compound their problems by watching pornography. Frustrated jobless people often compound their problems by drinking too much. A few years ago, white America only hastened its cultural and political dispossession by going to the theater and watching The Butler . 
Things are different now. The George Zimmerman trial, the Michael Brown shooting, and Black Lives Matter have helped many whites shed their last feelings of guilt. At the same time, Donald Trump has arrived almost like a modern version of the ‚Äú redeemers ‚Äù who helped end Reconstruction in the South. All this helps whites give ‚Äú black grievance porn ‚Äù the cold shoulder. 
In any case, blacks and whites have always watched different movies. From about 1915 until the early 1950s, the ‚Äú race film ‚Äù industry produced no fewer than 500 movies that touted an ‚Äúall black cast,‚Äù or an ‚Äúall-star Negro cast.‚Äù Oscar Micheaux was a major black producer in his day, but the only whites who know about him now are dorky cinephiles. Blacks didn‚Äôt want to watch Clark Gable or Joan Crawford, and when they went to a ‚Äúrace film‚Äù they could sit anywhere they liked in the theater. The original (and excellent) Birth of a Nation , about the Civil War and southern resistance to Reconstruction, was boycotted by the NAACP , but a boycott by blacks was mostly symbolic. In the 1970s, blacks gorged themselves on ‚Äú blaxploitation ‚Äù films, while whites occasionally watched one out of curiosity. 
Today, playwright and film-maker Tyler Perry is overwhelmingly popular with blacks‚Äìhe made $130 million in 2011, making him the highest paid man in entertainment that year‚Äìbut many whites have never even heard of him. Who honestly thinks there are many blacks who watch contemporary white films such as Interstellar or The Lord of the Rings or Gravity ? 
Only in recent and unfortunate times have large numbers of whites watched movies made by black film makers like Spike Lee who are openly contemptuous of whites. Let us hope this has finally come to an end.",1

Rise of the Alt-Right,"Scott McConnell, The American Conservative, October 31, 2016 
[Editor‚Äôs Note: This article is worth reading in its entirety. A redacted version is below.] 
Twenty-one years ago I was assigned by Commentary to write about Jared Taylor‚Äìtoday known as one of the eminences of the ‚Äúalt-right.‚Äù Taylor had written a grim book on American race relations, Paved With Good Intentions , which had been published by a mainstream house and was widely, if critically, reviewed. Though unusually skeptical about the prospect of blacks and whites living together harmoniously in the United States, it stopped well short of any systematically racist argument. The book had several fans among New Yorkers I knew prominent in journalism and city politics. 
When I referred to it in passing in a New York Post column, we quickly received a fax from Abe Foxman of the Anti-Defamation League stating that Taylor was far more extremist than I had let on. Curious to explore further, I queried Commentary ‚Äìwhere I then did most of my non-newspaper writing‚Äìand they were interested. 
I interviewed Taylor, read back issues of his monthly newsletter, American Renaissance ( AR ), and drafted a piece. AR was devoted primarily to demonstrating that in American history racism was as accepted as apple pie and that this was by no means a bad thing. It contained large doses of the evolutionary and biological racial thought fairly commonplace amongst American elites in the ‚Äô20s and ‚Äô30s. A central contention was that the United States could not thrive as an increasingly multiracial and multicultural country and that American whites were facing a kind of cultural dispossession. 
I summarized this, quoting liberally, and concluded that the endgame vision of the AR crowd was potentially horrific, leading to national dissolution or civil war, while adding that continued mass immigration really would put the common culture of America under grave stress. If immigration rates went down, Taylor and AR would remain fringe players. If they rose, white racial anxieties would bubble to the surface, and Taylor might one day have his moment. 
The piece was never published: Neal Kozodoy, Commentary ‚Äôs editor, told me I had indulged Taylor too much and asked for a shorter, tighter rewrite. By then my brief summer vacation had ended, other tasks intervened, and I eventually lost interest. 
Jared Taylor‚Äôs moment has not arrived, but clearly he has edged into the national conversation. He has been pictured and quoted in an anti-Trump attack ad produced by Hillary Clinton‚Äôs campaign, he has been a guest on Diane Rehm‚Äôs show on NPR, and his core ideas have been broadcast‚Äìand excoriated‚Äìin magazines and websites great and small. He is now touted as one of the intellectual leaders of the alt-right, a diffuse movement of uncertain significance, but one deemed sufficiently important by the Clinton campaign for Hillary to devote a large portion of an August campaign speech to it. Donald Trump‚Äìwho has almost surely never read a single article by an alt-right figure‚Äìis claimed by Clinton and other liberals to be under its influence and propagating its doctrines. 
The truth is quite different: parts of the alt-right have raised their own visibility by attaching themselves to Trump. At the same time, Trump and his unanticipated success in winning the Republican nomination are symptoms of the same political and civilizational crisis that makes alt-rightish themes‚Äìat least in a more or less bowdlerized and soft-core form‚Äìcompelling to a growing number of people. 
‚ô¶‚ô¶‚ô¶ 
Taylor, 65, is old by alt-right standards, and is an atypical representative, though just how much so is difficult to discern, for much of the alt-right is anonymous. The movement fields no candidates, publishes few books or pamphlets. It is a creature of the web, strongest on Twitter. Pepe, an internet cartoon frog, is an alt-right character‚Äìand has actually been formally denounced by the Clinton campaign. Alt-right internet trolling, sometimes ugly, blatantly racist and anti-Semitic, is also part of the movement. There is some debate whether it should be taken as an offensive and unfunny joke‚Äìmerry keyboard pranksters who enjoy pretending to be internet neo-Nazis, rather like punk rock bands of the late ‚Äô70s deploying Nazi imagery for shock effect‚Äìor is something more sinister, a genuine resurgence of hardcore racism and anti-Semitism. Likely it‚Äôs more the former, but it‚Äôs also likely that the alt-right banner has given the minute number of genuine neo-Nazis in the country a kind of protective shield. 
Richard Spencer may serve as a bridge between older white nationalists such as Taylor and a younger alt-right internet crowd. It‚Äôs mistaken to call him or anyone else a leader‚Äìthe movement has no procedure for choosing leaders‚Äìbut he is clearly a pole of influence. He‚Äôs an intellectual entrepreneur who arrived in DC roughly ten years ago from a Duke graduate program. He worked at TAC for seven or eight months, where he was kind of a square peg in a round hole. Sometime thereafter his ideology began to crystallize. He started a website called AlternativeRight.com and later revitalized a white-nationalist think tank, the National Policy Institute, and launched a journal, Radix . 
Spencer can be engaging and amusing, but his core doctrine is likely to remain, barring some sort of Mad Max-type Armageddon, well outside what most Americans would consider plausible or desirable. 
What is the doctrine? At a recent press conference in DC, Spencer explained that the core of alt-right thought is race. Race is real, race matters, race is foundational to human identity. You cannot understand who you are without race. Many people would agree‚Äìat least privately or partially‚Äìwith the first two assertions, but the third is the critical one, and has never been true historically or sociologically. (Not that there haven‚Äôt been groups of self-proclaimed pan-Asian or pan-African intellectuals who sought to make it true. Spencer fits into their tradition.) In any case, Spencer hopes somehow to spur whites into a kind of pan-white racial consciousness and galvanize them to become ‚Äúaware of who we are,‚Äù and to prepare themselves, one day somehow, to form a white ethnostate. He refers to Theodore Herzl‚Äôs propagation of Zionism as a model for how such an ethnostate, seemingly a distant dream, could be eventually achieved. He fails to add that it took a Holocaust to make a Jewish State a reality. 
{snip} 
Prior to last fall, and before Hillary introduced the alt-right to a national audience, Spencer and Taylor held periodic conferences that could gather perhaps 200 people. (These were often held under shameful harassment by the leftist anti-First Amendment crowd, but that‚Äôs a different issue.) Spencer says he sees the alt-right as a vehicle that will influence politicians and intellectuals, taking as its model neoconservatism. {snip} 
{snip} 
What spurred this sudden emergence? It was not white-nationalist conferences or doctrine, which had been around forever, but events. Last year the West received a nasty high-voltage shock of political reality. The first jolt was the Charlie Hebdo attack in January. France had experienced jihadist murders before, but this time, the strike came in the center of Paris, and France was alarmed to find no small amount of support for the killing among its five million Muslim residents, many of them second- and third-generation citizens. 
That spring and summer, European newspapers began to fill with reports of intensifying migrant and refugee flows, driven partially by the Syrian civil war and partially by the expansion and streamlining of people-smuggling routes from Africa. {snip} 
By 2016 the welcome had grown cold. Hundreds of migrants sexually assaulted German women in and around the central train station of Cologne on New Year‚Äôs Eve, a mass assault that German authorities initially tried to cover up. {snip} 
If the sexual assaults could be seen as the cultural edge of the migrant surge, it was more difficult for even liberal ‚Äúanti-racist‚Äù European leaders to ignore or explain away the terrorism aspect. The Charlie Hebdo attack was followed by the mass slaughters at the Bataclan theater in Paris, at the Brussels Airport, then on a seaside promenade in Nice, culminating in the execution by knife of an aging French priest by two ‚Äúassimilated‚Äù Muslim migrants in his church outside of Rouen. {snip} 
{snip} Richard Spencer may be incorrect about America, but one remark from his press conference in DC last month was arresting: 
The refugee crisis in Europe is something like a world war. It is in many ways a race war. In terms of direct violence it does not resemble World War I or II. It is a demographic struggle, a struggle for identity, a struggle of who is going to define the continent, period. It is a new kind of war, a postmodern war, a war through immigration. There are no trenches, no guns. But it is a world war. 
Of course, it is not primarily a race war. Religion, or religious culture, plays a major and perhaps decisive role in the conflict, and conflict between Christendom and Islam is not new by any means. Still, there is something in the bluntness of Spencer‚Äôs depiction that rings more true than 90 percent of what appears in the American media, which invariably depicts the refugee crisis in humanitarian terms and terrorism as a barely related law-enforcement issue. It is surely not a coincidence that the alt-right began making strides into American consciousness precisely at the moment Muslims were surging into Europe as refugees, while others were blowing up Parisian rock concerts or mounting mass sexual assaults on European women. 
{snip} 
Whatever one might say about the alt-right, it is not perplexed. Few other political factions in America had a vocabulary ready for‚Äìor even made an effort to interpret seriously‚Äìwhat was going on in Europe, at a time when many people were seeking one. 
{snip} 
American developments in the fall of last year, while less critical than those in Europe, also spurred the alt-right. The rise of Black Lives Matter put into question one of the outstanding domestic-policy advances of the past generation, the dramatic reduction in urban crime rates, which has made possible the revitalization of many cities. The lie which held that America‚Äôs police forces were chock full of marauding racist murderers suddenly became mainstream, repeated endlessly on television and pushed in only slightly more subtle fashion by Obama‚Äôs own attorney general. Meanwhile, some urban neighborhoods were looted by rioters, and others saw dramatic spikes in their murder rates. 
{snip} 
It was predictable that such developments, touching on visceral areas of personal security, national sovereignty, and freedom of expression, would stir desire for a muscular response. Donald Trump filled the bill, if not always eloquently. So too, occasionally, did segments of the more established conservative media. But there was a market for a pushback as scathing and polemically unafraid as the left‚Äôs own polemicists, which might not have been the case four years earlier. This, as much as anything, accounts for the emergence of the alt-right, at least in its less ideologically extreme iterations. 
{snip} 
And though [Samuel] Huntington was a famous and deeply respected Harvard political scientist and a life-long Democrat, the concerns of Clash are those raised implicitly by Trump and explicitly by what I call the soft-core elements of the alt-right. There is, of course, much racism in American history, and there are enormous crimes for which Europe continues to strive to atone. But neither anti-racism nor respect for other cultures should be turned into a national or civilizational suicide pact. Here what Irving Kristol famously wrote about Sen. Joseph McCarthy comes to mind: ‚ÄúThere is one thing that the American people know about Senator McCarthy: he like them is unequivocally anti-Communist. About the spokesmen for American liberalism, they feel they know no such thing.‚Äù 
In the now global faceoff between Western civilization versus mass immigration fused with multiculturalism, Kristol‚Äôs words describe with uncanny accuracy the dichotomy between Donald Trump and his supporters on one hand and those most feverishly denouncing him on the other. Among the former, for all their faults, are those who want, unequivocally, Western civilization to survive. About the latter, no such thing is certain.",1
Hate Rising with Jorge Ramos,"Hate Rising with Jorge Ramos Fusion, October 28, 2016 
From the Ku Klux Klan to the so called alt-right movement, white supremacist groups are growing in numbers and influence. In ‚ÄúHate Rising,‚Äù Jorge Ramos shows us how their ideas, usually confined to private and secretive gatherings, are becoming mainstream thanks in part to the rhetoric on the campaign trail this election cycle.

"Affirmative Action, Immigration and the Politics of Racial Solidarity","Ben Cohen, American Thinker, October 31, 2016 
In his ‚ÄúAn open letter to cuckservatives‚Äù, Jared Taylor wrote, 
Why do you evoke Martin Luther King when you call for a ‚Äúcolorblind‚Äù America? You know he wanted quotas for blacks. You evoke King because you think he‚Äôll help you silence blacks and liberals. But it doesn‚Äôt work, does it? That‚Äôs because only whites‚Äìand Asians, when it suits them‚Äìeven think in terms of ‚Äúcolorblindness.‚Äù Blacks and Hispanics will squeeze every unfair advantage out of you they can. At what point will they ever abandon their aggressive racial agenda? When they‚Äôre the majority just think how hard they‚Äôll squeeze your grandchildren. 
Advocates of white identity politics have two basic arguments at their disposal. The first argument could be called the racial preservationist argument, and the second could be called the collective interest argument. 
The first argument holds that national character reflects the genetics of the national population, therefore miscegenation and non-white immigration will radically alter the national character. As Jared Taylor put it, the future ‚ÄúAfro-Hispanic-Caribbean-Asiatic America‚Äù will be totally unrecognizable to the founding fathers, and completely alien from the America we grew up in. 
Whatever relationship exists between national genetics and national culture, the preservationist argument has largely failed to persuade white Americans. In 1958 only 4 percent of Americans approved of white-black marriage, by 2013 87% of Americans approved of white-black marriage. For millennials, the numbers are even higher. 
But what about revealed preferences? For decades, white Americans have migrated from more homogeneous northern states to more diverse sunbelt states. In 2010, 9.4% of non-Hispanic white newlyweds married either a Hispanic person or a non-white person. 
Undoubtedly, passionate opponents of interracial marriage still exist‚Äìnot all of them white‚Äìbut their arguments haven‚Äôt persuaded many people. Any argument for white nationalism or white identity politics centered on the need for racial purity is pretty much dead on arrival, because most white people don‚Äôt care about racial purity. 
With appeals to racial purity out of fashion, racialists are left with appeals to collective interest. At the Alt-right press conference, Jared Taylor warned white people that their children wouldn‚Äôt simply be a minority, but ‚Äúthe way things are going, a hated minority.‚Äù 
This quote sticks out. Within our prison system, violent race riots have claimed the lives of many inmates. Prisoners largely segregate themselves by race, and enforce a fairly rigid system of racial separation. Based on past experience, race appears to be a particularly violent and nasty fault line. 
Even people who aren‚Äôt racist will band together along racial lines, if they perceive themselves to be under threat. Most liberals find the idea of white people being persecuted ridiculous, and at the present moment it is. 
But the possibility of anti-white discrimination isn‚Äôt as remote as many liberals would like to think. As J. Christian Adams documented, the Obama administration refused to prosecute minorities who engaged in voter intimidation. According to Adams they didn‚Äôt simply drop charges against the NBPP members caught brandishing a club at voters in Philadelphia, they actually instructed the voting rights division not to prosecute any non-white person for voter intimidation. 
If a white president refused to prosecute racist white thugs for intimidating black voters, black people would be rightfully alarmed. There is no reason to expect whites to react differently. 
At this point, liberal readers will be saying to themselves, ‚Äúblacks are twelve percent of the population, what do we have to worry about?‚Äù 
Except, when America becomes a majority minority nation, future presidents will no longer have to depend on white votes to get elected. Future leaders could build a coalition of black and Hispanic voters, held together by shared interests. 
If this is starting to make sense to liberal readers, keep reading, it gets worse. Non-white immigrants benefit from a host of affirmative action and ‚Äúdiversity‚Äù programs. In other words, immigration increases the political clout of affirmative action beneficiaries. Why exactly should white people welcome immigrants who will be favored over them? 
Especially galling is the fact that many affirmative action beneficiaries are neither poor nor disadvantaged. What are poor whites in West Virginia supposed to think about millionaire Cuban immigrants being favored over them? 
This author supports moderate immigration restriction of the type advocated by the likes of Jorge Borges or Mark Krikorian; however, he does not want white Americans to hate or fear non-white immigrants. Liberals, on the other hand, seem intent on pursuing policies almost guaranteed to revive white racism. 
This article began with a quote from Jared Taylor‚Äôs letter to cuckservatives. He should add liberals to his mailing list. Liberals supplied Jared with his most persuasive argument; they deserve a thank you note and a gift card.",1
Professor Who Tweeted Against PC Culture Is Out at NYU,"Professor Who Tweeted Against PC Culture Is Out at NYU Melkorka Licea, New York Post, October 30, 2016 
An NYU professor crusading against political correctness and student coddling was booted from the classroom last week after his colleagues complained about his ‚Äúincivility,‚Äù The Post has learned. 
Liberal studies prof Michael Rectenwald, 57, said he was forced Wednesday to go on paid leave for the rest of the semester. 
{snip} 
Rectenwald launched an undercover Twitter account called Deplorable NYU Prof on Sept. 12 to argue against campus trends like ‚Äúsafe spaces,‚Äù ‚Äútrigger warnings‚Äù policing Halloween costumes and other aspects of academia‚Äôs growing PC culture. 
He chose to be anonymous, he explained in one of his first tweets, because he was afraid ‚Äúthe PC Gestapo would ruin me‚Äù if he put his name ¬≠behind his conservative ideas on the famously liberal campus. 
{snip} 
But the Twitter feed soon sparked a ‚Äúwitch hunt‚Äù by the growing army of ‚Äúsocial justice warriors,‚Äù he said. 
In an interview published Monday in the Washington Square News, NYU‚Äôs Independent Student Newspaper, the eight-year instructor admitted he was the Deplorable NYU Prof. 
‚ÄúMy contention is that trigger warning, safe spaces and bias hot-line reporting is not politically correct. It is insane,‚Äù he told the student paper. ‚ÄúThe crazier and crazier that this left gets .‚Äâ.‚Äâ. the more the alt-right is going to be laughing their asses off [and] getting more pissed.‚Äù, he was quoted as saying. 
{snip} 
But Rectenwald says he began getting ‚Äúdirty looks‚Äù in his department and on Wednesday figured out why: A 12-person committee calling itself the Liberal Studies Diversity, Equity and Inclusion Working Group, including two deans, published a letter to the editor in the same paper. 
‚ÄúAs long as he airs his views with so little appeal to evidence and civility, we must find him guilty of illogic and incivility in a community that predicates its work in great part on rational thought and the civil exchange of ideas,‚Äù they wrote of the untenured assistant professor. 
‚ÄúWe seek to create a dynamic community that values full participation. Such efforts are not the ‚Äòdestruction of academic integrity‚Äô Professor Rectenwald suggests, but rather what make possible our program‚Äôs approach to global studies,‚Äù they argued. Rectenwald likened the attack to ‚Äúa Salem witch trial. They took my views personally. I never even mentioned them and I never even said NYU liberal studies program. I was talking about academia at large,‚Äù said the professor, a popular instructor who was graded 4.4 out of 5 on ratemyprofessors.com . 
The same day the letter was published, Rectenwald was summoned to a meeting with his department dean and an HR representative, he says. 
‚ÄúThey claimed they were worried about me and a couple people had expressed concern about my mental health. They suggested my voicing these opinions was a cry for help,‚Äù Rectenwald told The Post. ‚ÄúThen they said I should leave and get help.‚Äù 
{snip} 
Students told him that professors openly discussed with students how he may be fired. 
The leave has ‚Äúabsolutely zero to do with his Twitter account or his opinions on issues of the day,‚Äù said NYU spokesman Matt Nagel. 
But Rectenwald is disheartened. 
‚ÄúI‚Äôm afraid my academic career is over,‚Äù he said Rectenwald. ‚ÄúAcademic freedom: It‚Äôs great, as long as you don‚Äôt use it.‚Äù",1
Postering Advice for Alt-Right Guerrilla Activists,"Kyle Bristow, Foundation for the Marketplace of Ideas, October 30, 2016 
{snip} As a veteran of trolling leftists for an entire decade (the SPLC whines I have ‚Äúbeen playing * * * [this] same kind of game for many years‚Äù and that I am ‚Äúone of the Alt-Right‚Äôs most vicious attack dogs‚Äù ; the student newspaper of Michigan State University noted in 2006 that my group planned to ‚Äúhave more events such as chalking * * * [and] poster-hanging[s]‚Äù ; Michigan State University‚Äôs President Lou Anna Simon releases a statement in 2007 which pertinently states ‚ÄúIn recent weeks, there have been incidents on campus that once again compel us to look at the issues of free speech and how we as a campus community engage with one another in ways that respect the views of multiple groups and individuals. * * * There are individuals who speak at campus events whose rhetoric and ideas I find reprehensible[.]‚Äù ), I have personal experience with postering campaigns, and as an attorney, I know exactly where the line is that cannot be crossed. Here are suggestions to Alt-Right activists who are interested in hanging up posters: Do not get caught. Targets for postering should be explored in advance of distribution so as to make sure that there are no security cameras in the vicinity. (Do not wear similar clothing when the venue is explored as is worn at the time of the postering in case cameras are present.) Use teams of at least three‚Äìone person hangs up posters and two people watch for interlopers. The best time to poster is between 10:00 p.m. and midnight‚Äîany earlier, and one is likely to run into Normies, and any later, one will attract unwanted attention. Tape is best to use for postering and the tape should be used along all four edges of the posters so as to prevent them from being ripped down; tacks can easily be removed to take down posters and glue should not be used because glue is too messy and time-consuming. Hanging up posters in university buildings that contain only classrooms at night is better than dormitories because one is less likely to run into people who may tear down the posters. Only hang up posters at public‚Äìnot private‚Äìuniversities and on public bulletin boards. Public universities must comply with the U.S. Constitution‚Äìand the First and Fourteenth Amendments prohibit government actors from discriminating against viewpoint or the content of speech. Only hang up posters on public bulletin boards since an argument can be made if one is caught that this is either a public forum or limited public forum . If one hangs up a poster on a wall of a building or on a non-public bulletin board, diversity-mongers who are offended by the posters may allege that criminal vandalism or criminal trespass occurred. Do not voluntarily disclose information if caught. If someone who is not a police officer demands one‚Äôs identification, one is under no obligation to provide it. If a police officer demands one‚Äôs identification, only the identifiers on a driver‚Äôs license and identifiers that are not incriminating should be provided (name, address, phone number, birth date, etc). One should not say anything else to the police other than ‚ÄúI respectfully invoke my right to remain silent, I respectfully invoke my right to have an attorney present, and am I being detained?‚Äù Such language invokes rights that are outside the scope of this brief article, but anyone who has ever watched an episode of Cops would know that statements made by a criminal suspect can be used against that person in court and lying to the police during an investigation is a crime in and of itself. If one‚Äôs state is a one-party consent state for recording purposes , one should secretly record any and all interactions with law enforcement. One should immediately consult with a licensed attorney in their state who is experienced with criminal defense or civil litigation if police become involved due to one hanging up posters. Do not publish posters that target individual people. This could result in harassment-related criminal charges, a civil lawsuit, or a personal protection order being pursued by the victim. Posters that are merely generically inflammatory but which do not direct the viewers to ‚Äúimminent lawless action‚Äù are constitutionally permissible. Brandenburg v. Ohio , 395 U.S. 444 (1969) .

Agents Accuse Feds of Covering Up Record Border Detainee Numbers for 2016 Election,"Agents Accuse Feds of Covering Up Record Border Detainee Numbers for 2016 Election Brandon Darby, Breitbart, October 30, 2016 
A record number of illegal aliens have crossed the U.S.- Mexico border and are in U.S. Border Patrol custody in Texas‚Äô Rio Grande Valley Sector (RGV), according to the National Border Patrol Council (NBPC). Border Patrol Agent and NBPC President Brandon Judd spoke exclusively with Breitbart Texas and condemned the leadership of the Border Patrol‚Äôs parent agency, Customs and Border Protection (CBP), for allegedly ‚Äúkeeping this information secret‚Äù ahead of the 2016 U.S. presidential election. 
‚ÄúWe are at breaking point. We have the highest number of illegal aliens in custody in history in Border Patrol‚Äôs RGV Sector and this information has been kept from the American public,‚Äù said Agent Judd. ‚ÄúThe talk of amnesty has once again created pull factors and encouraged people from all over the world to cross Mexico and then cross our porous southern border to illegally enter the U.S. We are simply overwhelmed.‚Äù {snip} 
Agent Judd told Breitbart Texas that Americans should vote their conscience, but they should do so with all of the information available. ‚ÄúThis is an issue of the federal government restricting crucial information from the public ahead of a presidential election and it is unacceptable. Americans deserve to know the truth. Our Border Patrol agents deserve for Americans to know what they are really facing. Too many Border Patrol agents have given their lives and left loved ones to grieve for CBP leadership to play these types of political games ahead of such an impactful election.‚Äù 
{snip} 
Historically, CBP, Border Patrol‚Äôs parent agency, has had to correct false assertions and denials. Perhaps the most glaring example occurred in June 2014 when an official CBP Twitter account directly accused this reporter of publishing a false report, only to later admit the report was accurate and true . 
{snip} 
UPDATE: Breitbart Texas received this response from CBP: 
First, the number in custody in RGV is less than half what is was in June 2014. 
Also, I would refer you to Secretary Johnson‚Äôs statement about southwest border security issued October 17. In it, the Secretary addresses the specific issue of unaccompanied children and family units. The statement includes statistics for the full year of fiscal year 2016.

Sex Differences in the Right Tail of Cognitive Abilities: An Update and Cross Cultural Extension,"Matthew C. Makel et al., Science Direct, October 31, 2016 
Abstract 
Male‚Äìfemale ability differences in the right tail (at or above the 95th percentile) have been widely discussed for their potential role in achievement and occupational differences in adults. The present study provides updated male-female ability ratios from 320,000 7th grade students in the United States in the right tail (top 5%) through the extreme right tail (top 0.01%) from 2011 to 2015 using measures of math, verbal, and science reasoning. Additionally, the present study establishes male-female ability ratios in a sample of over 7000 7th grade students in the right tail from 2011 to 2015 in India. Results indicate that ratios in the extreme right tail of math ability in the U.S. have shrunk in the last 20 years (still favoring males) and remained relatively stable in the verbal domain (still favoring females). Similar patterns of male-female ratios in the extreme right tail were found in the Indian sample.",1

‚ÄòWe Are Losing Control of the Streets‚Äô Merkel‚Äôs Germany Descends into Lawlessness,"Siobhan McFadyen, Express, October 31, 2016 
German Chancellor Angela Merkel is facing catastrophe over her failed migrant policy, according to a new report. 
During the first six months of 2016, migrants committed 142,500 crimes, according to the Federal Criminal Police Office. 
And the country has been hit by a spate of horrendous violent crime including rapes, sexual and physical assaults, stabbings, home invasions, robberies, burglaries and drug trafficking. 
Adding to the country‚Äôs woes is the fact that thousands of people have gone missing after travelling to the country on invitation from the country‚Äôs leader. 
Germany took in more than 1.1million migrants in the past year and parts of the country are crippled with a lack of infrastructure. 
Now the true reality is hitting home ahead of next year‚Äôs elections as the far right surges in the polls threatening to topple the Christian Democratic Union (CDU) leader Mrs Merkel. 
According to a report by the international policy council the Gatestone Institute, local police in many parts of the country admit that they are stretched to the limit. 
The report states: ‚ÄúThe rape of a ten-year-old girl in Leipzig, the largest city in Saxony, has drawn renewed attention to the spiralling levels of violent crime perpetrated by migrants in cities and towns across Germany. 
‚ÄúDuring the first six months of 2016, migrants committed 142,500 crimes, according to the Federal Criminal Police Office. This is equivalent to 780 crimes committed by migrants every day, an increase of nearly 40 per cent over 2015. The data includes only those crimes in which a suspect has been caught. 
‚ÄúThousands of migrants who entered the country as ‚Äòasylum seekers‚Äô or ‚Äòrefugees‚Äô have gone missing. They are, presumably, economic migrants who entered Germany on false pretences. 
‚ÄúMany are thought to be engaging in robbery and criminal violence.‚Äù 
According to Freddi Lohse of the German Police Union in Hamburg, many migrant offenders view the leniency of the German justice system as a green light to continue delinquent behaviour, says the report. 
He said: ‚ÄúThey are used to tougher consequences in their home countries. 
‚ÄúThey have no respect for us.‚Äù 
Meanwhile a female police officer has admitted that officers are under attack and that the courts are a ‚Äújoke.‚Äù 
In a new book, Tania Kambouri, a German police officer, said: ‚ÄúFor weeks, months and years I have noticed that Muslims, mostly young men, do not have even a minimum level of respect for the police. 
‚ÄúWhen we are out patrolling the streets, we are verbally abused by young Muslims. 
‚ÄúThere is the body language, and insults like ‚Äòs*** cop‚Äô when passing by. 
‚ÄúIf we make a traffic stop, the aggression increases ever further, this is overwhelmingly the case with migrants. 
‚ÄúIt cannot be that offenders continue to fill the police files, hurt us physically, insult us, whatever, and there are no consequences. 
‚ÄúMany cases are closed or offenders are released on probation or whatever. 
‚ÄúYes, what is happening in the courts today is a joke.‚Äù 
Migrants committed 208,344 crimes in 2015, according to a confidential police report leaked to Bild. 
This figure represents an 80 per cent increase since 2014 and is equivalent to 570 crimes committed by migrants every day, or 23 crimes each hour, in 2015 alone. 
The report added: ‚ÄúThe growing sense of lawlessness is substantiated by an October 24 YouGov poll which found that 68 per cent of Germans believe that security in the country has deteriorated during the past several years. 
‚ÄúNearly 70 per cent of respondents said they fear for their lives and property in German train stations and subways, while 63 per cent feel unsafe at large public events.‚Äù",1
Places Most Unsettled by Rapid Demographic Change Are Drawn to Donald Trump,"Places Most Unsettled by Rapid Demographic Change Are Drawn to Donald Trump Janet Adamy and Paul Overberg, Wall Street Journal, November 1, 2016 
Small towns in the Midwest have diversified more quickly than almost any part of the U.S. since the start of an immigration wave at the beginning of this century. The resulting cultural changes appear to be moving the political needle. 
A Wall Street Journal analysis of census data shows that counties in a distinct cluster of Midwestern states‚ÄìIowa, Indiana, Wisconsin, Illinois and Minnesota‚Äìsaw among the fastest influxes of nonwhite residents of anywhere in the U.S. between 2000 and 2015. Hundreds of cities long dominated by white residents got a burst of Latino newcomers who migrated from Central America or uprooted from California and Texas. 
That shift helps explain the emergence of Republican presidential nominee Donald J. Trump as a political force, and signals that tensions over immigration will likely outlive his candidacy. Among GOP voters in this year‚Äôs presidential primaries, counties that diversified rapidly were more likely to vote for the New York businessman, the Journal‚Äôs analysis shows. 
{snip} 
The Journal identified the epicenter of this shift using the diversity index, a tool often used by social scientists and economists. It measures the chance that any two people in a county will have a different race or ethnicity. In 244 counties, that diversity index at least doubled between 2000 and 2015, and more than half those counties were in the cluster of five Midwestern states. The analysis excludes tiny counties that produce numeric aberrations. 
{snip} 
Mr. Trump won about 71% of sizable counties nationwide during the Republican presidential primaries. He took 73% of those where diversity at least doubled since 2000, and 80% of those where the diversity index rose at least 150%, the Journal‚Äôs analysis found.

Early Voting Data Shows African American Turnout Dropping,"Early Voting Data Shows African American Turnout Dropping Neil Munro, Breitbart, October 31, 2016 
A blizzard of early reports show that early voting by pro-Democratic African-Americans has dropped significantly compared to 2012, giving a boost to Donald Trump‚Äôs prospects in critical swing-states, such as North Carolina and Ohio. 
In North Carolina, early voting by African-Americans is sharply down, so ‚Äúyou will see a very heavy push in this state for the African-American vote by Hilary Clinton to try to make up some of deficit,‚Äù said Michael Bitzer, a professor of politics and history at Catawba College, in Salisbury, N.C. 
{snip} 
Nationally, ‚ÄúAfrican-American enthusiasm has dipped compared with that in 2012,‚Äù according to the New York Times . That‚Äôs ‚Äúa surprising and disquieting development for Democrats who believed Trump‚Äôs racial appeals and flirtations with the birther movement would generate more urgency,‚Äù the Times reported . For example, in the two Virginia districts with the largest percentage of African American adults, early voting has dropped by more than 50 percent, the Times said. 
In Ohio, the decline of early voting in heavily Democratic African-American districts is causing worry for Democrats‚Äìand a shift of resources into the low-turnout areas. {snip} 
In Florida, ‚Äúthe bad news for Clinton/good news for Trump is that African-Americans and millenials are voting considerably lighter‚Äìso far‚Äìthan four years ago,‚Äù the Tampa Bay Times reported Oct. 31. 
Daniel Smith, a political science professor in Florida noted the rising level of early voting among whites and Hispanics, compared to to African-Americans. 
In North Carolina, ‚Äúwhite voters are currently 72 percent of all absentee ballots cast, with black voters being 22 percent and all other races 6 percent. This represents a steady continuation of the trends that we have seen, with white voters over-performing their 2012 numbers and black voters under-performing their 2012 numbers,‚Äù Blitzer said at his blog, Old North State Politics .

"As Race Tightens, Clinton Campaign Is Counting on Minority Support","David Weigel, Washington Post, October 31, 2016 
{snip} 
Following the latest FBI inquiry, which has dominated news coverage for days and has been described as a potential lifeline for Republican nominee Donald Trump, Clinton‚Äôs campaign is counting on its organization more than ever to revive the coalition that twice elected Barack Obama. 
In places such as Michigan, that means turning out minorities in big numbers to overcome Trump‚Äôs advantage among white voters. The trend in early-voting returns has been both encouraging and worrying for the Clinton campaign: Enthusiasm among Latinos appears to be up, in some cases considerably, but African Americans are turning out in smaller numbers than they did with Obama on the ticket. 
That‚Äôs the picture in Florida. Early returns show a boost in turnout in heavily Latino counties and a decline in largely African American ones. In a state such as Nevada, where Democrats are relying heavily on Latinos, early returns show they are voting in similar numbers as in 2012, boosting Democratic chances. But in battleground states such as Ohio where Democrats are counting on African Americans to put them over the top, they could be in trouble if blacks stay home. 
Polling shows a similar story. Clinton maintains a large lead among nonwhite voters in the Washington Post-ABC News tracking poll, but by a smaller margin than Obama did. In polling since Oct. 20, Clinton has led Trump by more than 3 to 1 among all nonwhites (69 percent to 19 percent), compared with President Obama‚Äôs margin of 80 percent to 19 percent in 2012. 
Moreover, nonwhite voters are more united by their strong dislike of Trump than positive views of Clinton‚Äìonly 39 percent have a strongly favorable view of Clinton, while 68 percent have strongly unfavorable views toward Trump. 
{snip} 
In closer states, Trump‚Äôs campaign is working to soften enthusiasm for Clinton among young black voters. One TV ad plays a clip of Clinton, then supportive of a new crime bill, referring to a group of young black offenders as ‚Äúsuper-predators.‚Äù That two-decade-old quote‚Äìeven after an apology‚Äìhas dogged Clinton with some Black Lives Matters activists. Trump has also sought to dampen enthusiasm by casting life in black communities as something akin to apocalyptic. 
{snip} In North Carolina, where Democrats and civil rights groups won a high-profile lawsuit against Republican-backed voting restrictions, the early look is mixed. Total black turnout has fallen 17 percent from its 2012 level, but Democrats point to a shrunken number of early-voting locations to claim that they are on track. At the polls, the voters who are showing up said they feel an obligation, if not passion. 
‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not like four years ago when we knew we were going for Barack Obama, no ifs, ands and buts,‚Äù Sunia Wilson, 38, said after casting a ballot at the Chavis Community Center in Raleigh. ‚ÄúThis year it‚Äôs like, ‚ÄòHmmm. I don‚Äôt know.‚Äô But I‚Äôve got to vote.‚Äù

Study Finds Racial Discrimination by Uber and Lyft Drivers,"Study Finds Racial Discrimination by Uber and Lyft Drivers Eric Newcomer, Bloomberg, October 31, 2016 
Drivers for Uber Technologies Inc. in Boston canceled rides for men with black-sounding names more than twice as often as for other men. Black people in Seattle using Uber and Lyft Inc. faced notably longer wait times to get paired with drivers than white customers. The findings come from a study published on Monday by researchers at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Stanford University and the University of Washington. 
{snip} 
A new generation of technology companies have begun to grapple with how they can minimize racial discrimination. Airbnb Inc. recently released an extensive report studying racial bias on the site and proposed some changes to its policies. The home-rental company committed to offering more training for its hosts and hiring a more diverse workforce. It sent e-mails to customers over the weekend saying they must agree not to discriminate in order to use the site starting next month. However, Airbnb has resisted advocates‚Äô calls to remove photos of guests and hosts from its platform. 
In the case of ride-hailing apps, researchers similarly believe that names and photos are an issue. Such information gives drivers the means to discriminate against prospective riders. Uber doesn‚Äôt show customer photos to drivers. Lyft does, but passengers aren‚Äôt required to provide a headshot. Both San Francisco-based companies give riders‚Äô names to their drivers. 
{snip} 
The study, conducted in Seattle and Boston, included almost 1,500 rides. Four black and four white research assistants‚Äìsplit evenly among men and women‚Äìordered cars over six weeks in Seattle. All used their photos on the ride-sharing apps. A second test was held in Boston with riders ‚Äúwhose appearance allowed them to plausibly travel as a passenger of either race,‚Äù although they used either ‚ÄúAfrican American sounding‚Äù or ‚Äúwhite sounding‚Äù names, the researchers said. The study found that Uber drivers disproportionately canceled on riders with black-sounding names, even though the company penalizes drivers who cancel frequently. 
{snip} 
The research also observed discrimination in the taxi industry‚Äìa well-known, decades-old issue. The paper doesn‚Äôt compare the rate of discrimination between traditional drivers for taxis or ride-hailing apps. Uber has suggested that it doesn‚Äôt offer tips in its app, as many drivers have asked for, because they can introduce racial biases. 
Lyft and Uber face different issues. While researchers found that drivers took noticeably longer to accept ride requests from black men on both services in Seattle, total wait times were the same for both races on Lyft. On Uber, total wait times were longer for black men. Drivers using Lyft didn‚Äôt cancel on black riders disproportionately, but the researchers said that because Lyft shows riders‚Äô names and faces upfront, its drivers could simply screen out black passengers. Uber doesn‚Äôt show names until after the driver accepts the fare. ‚ÄúIn Lyft, you can discriminate without ever having to accept and hit cancel,‚Äù Knittel said.

Chicago Soars Past 600 Homicides After Bloody October,"Chicago Soars Past 600 Homicides After Bloody October CBS Chicago, November 1, 2016 
With 78 homicides, October was the second deadliest month of 2016, and Chicago surpassed 600 homicides for the first time in more than a decade. 
The last time Chicago had at least 600 homicides in a single year was 2003. 
Homicides and non-fatal shootings have skyrocketed in 2016, with 605 homicides and more than 3,600 shooting victims through the end of October. 
In October, there were 78 homicides and 427 shooting victims. Only August had more homicides, when 90 people were slain in Chicago. It was the bloodiest month in the city in 20 years. 
The city is on pace for 726 homicides in 2016, a number not seen since the late 1990s.

"SWAT Standoff Suspect Linked to Zionsville Murder, IMPD HQ Shootings","SWAT Standoff Suspect Linked to Zionsville Murder, IMPD HQ Shootings Rich van Wyk and David Macanally, WTHR (Indianapolis), October 31, 2016 
The suspect in a SWAT standoff on Indianapolis‚Äô far northeast side Monday afternoon has been connected to recent shootings at IMPD headquarters and the September murder of an 82-year-old Zionsville man. 
Damoine Wilcoxson surrendered peacefully around 4:15 p.m. after a hours-long standoff with IMPD at an apartment complex near Shadeland Ave. & Mill View Dr. Damoine Wilcoxson 
Wilcoxson was holding his 6-month-old son inside the apartment during the standoff. The boy‚Äôs grandmother stood across the street during the ordeal, waiting alongside everyone else and hoping he would be okay. 
{snip} 
Wilcoxson was armed during the standoff and police say he fired at officers through the door. No one was injured and officers did not return fire due to concerns for the child. 
{snip} 
Prosecutors say Wilcoxson faces a murder charge for the shooting death of John Clements less than half a mile from Zionsville High School on Sept. 28 . It was the first murder Zionsville has seen in 20 years. 
{snip} 
According to court documents, investigators believe Wilcoxson is also related to the IMPD headquarters shootings that occurred on October 4 and October 13. Detectives found handwritten notes demanding $100,000 and threats including ‚Äúwhite must die‚Äù near the shell casings that were connected with the Oct. 4 shooting at IMPD Northwest District headquarters. Similar notes were found near the shell casings discovered after the Oct. 13 shooting at IMPD North District headquarters. 
‚ÄúAt least in one of those shootings, we believe that he intentionally targeted two police officers inside,‚Äù IMPD Chief Troy Riggs said, ‚Äúand we‚Äôre going to be requesting attempted murder charges.‚Äù 
He allegedly fired almost 50 rounds at those police stations earlier this month. No officers were hurt, but he allegedly left a note at the crime scene threatening more shootings if he didn‚Äôt get $100,000. 
Detectives discovered that the shell casings from both IMPD shootings were a match. A DNA sample from one of the notes and a shell casing matched Wilcoxson‚Äôs profile. 
Court papers say forensic evidence links his gun to all those cases, but his stepfather says, ‚ÄúNo, no, no, he‚Äôs not.‚Äù 
The stepfather doesn‚Äôt believe Damoine is connected to those crimes. 
His aunt, Detra Boyd, said, ‚ÄúHe had a moment. That‚Äôs all.‚Äù 
{snip} 
FBI undercover agents friended him on Facebook during the probe into the police station attacks and the Zionsville murder. According to court documents, they found anti-white remarks and posts like ‚ÄúKill mankind. No one should survive. We all live in lies,‚Äù plus ‚Äúeye-4-eye, tooth for tooth, head for head, life for life.‚Äù

"Most College Students Think America Invented Slavery, Professor Finds","Most College Students Think America Invented Slavery, Professor Finds Kate Hardiman, College Fix, October 31, 2016 
For 11 years, Professor Duke Pesta gave quizzes to his students at the beginning of the school year to test their knowledge on basic facts about American history and Western culture. 
The most surprising result from his 11-year experiment? Students‚Äô overwhelming belief that slavery began in the United States and was almost exclusively an American phenomenon, he said. 
‚ÄúMost of my students could not tell me anything meaningful about slavery outside of America,‚Äù Pesta told The College Fix . ‚ÄúThey are convinced that slavery was an American problem that more or less ended with the Civil War, and they are very fuzzy about the history of slavery prior to the Colonial era. Their entire education about slavery was confined to America.‚Äù 
Pesta , currently an associate professor of English at the University of Wisconsin Oshkosh, has taught the gamut of Western literature‚Äìfrom the Classics to the modern‚Äìat seven different universities, ranging from large research institutions to small liberal arts colleges to branch campuses. He said he has given the quizzes to students at Purdue University, University of Tennessee Martin, Ursinus College, Oklahoma State University, and University of Wisconsin Oshkosh. 
{snip} 
Before even distributing the syllabus for his courses, Pesta administered his short quizzes with basic questions about American history, economics and Western culture. For instance, the questions asked students to circle which of three historical figures was a president of the United States, or to name three slave-holding countries over the last 2,000 years, or define ‚Äúcapitalism‚Äù and ‚Äúsocialism‚Äù in one sentence each. 
Often, more students connected Thomas Jefferson to slavery than could identify him as president, according to Pesta. On one quiz, 29 out of 32 students responding knew that Jefferson owned slaves, but only three out of the 32 correctly identified him as president. Interestingly, more students‚Äìsix of 32‚Äìactually believed Ben Franklin had been president. 
{snip} 
What‚Äôs more, he began to observe a shift in his students‚Äô quiz responses in the early 2000s. Before that time, Pesta described his students as ‚Äúoften historically ignorant, but not politicized.‚Äù Since the early 2000s, Pesta has found that ‚Äúmany students come to college preprogrammed in certain ways.‚Äù 
‚ÄúThey cannot tell you many historical facts or relate anything meaningful about historical biographies, but they are, however, stridently vocal about the corrupt nature of the Republic, about the wickedness of the founding fathers, and about the evils of free markets,‚Äù Pesta said. ‚ÄúMost alarmingly, they know nothing about the fraught history of Marxist ideology and communist governments over the last century, but often reductively define socialism as ‚Äòfairness.‚Äô‚Äù 
Pesta also noted that, early on, his students‚Äô ‚Äúblissful ignorance was accompanied by a basic humility about what they did not know.‚Äù But over time he said he increasingly saw ‚Äúa sense of moral superiority in not knowing anything about our ‚Äòracist and sexist‚Äô history and our ‚Äòbiased‚Äô institutions.‚Äù 
‚ÄúAs we now see on campus,‚Äù Pesta said, ‚Äúsocial justice warriors are arguing that even reading the great books of Western culture is at best a micro-aggression, and at worst an insidious form of cultural imperialism and indoctrination.‚Äù

America Is Better Without Borders,"America Is Better Without Borders Steven Hahn, TIME, November 1, 2016 
‚ÄúA nation without borders,‚Äù Donald Trump has warned us , ‚Äúis not a nation at all.‚Äù Trump was explaining the logic of the multi-billion dollar wall he promises to build along the U.S.-Mexican border, but he was hardly the first to make the case. Years ago, Ronald Reagan said much the same about the threat of illegal immigration, and others urging border vigilance have wrapped themselves in the high-flown rhetoric. Tee-shirts and coffee mugs have turned the idea into a saleable slogan. 
{snip} 
{snip} For much of its early history, the United States had hazy borders in good part because through war, conquest and diplomacy the country was constantly expanding and the shifting boundaries were not clearly marked. There was no agreement about how far west the Louisiana Territory reached or how far south the state of Texas stretched or how far north the Oregon Territory extended. Highly charged political words and brutal conflict followed (like the U.S.-Mexican War), while the imperial eyes of many leaders fell on Cuba, Central America and Hawaii. 
What‚Äôs more, the borders that were agreed upon were remarkably porous. Until well into the nineteenth century, immigrants could come and go at will and even participate in electoral politics if they simply declared an intention to become citizens; indeed, for decades it was not at all clear what a citizen of the United States was. The only international migration policed was the African slave trade, which Congress outlawed in 1808 after nearly half a million captives had been forcibly deposited on North American shores. 
{snip} 
It is easy, when politics and ethnocentrism serve, to proclaim the principle of the nation with borders as the nation itself, while the borders are, in fact, regularly traversed by policy makers, investors and moneyed interests pursuing the main chance and wielding the big stick. Trump himself regularly touts, though refuses to reveal, his international dealings, many of which confound his goal of keeping jobs within American borders if they don‚Äôt outright violate American laws. 
Truth is that the nation‚Äôs prosperity has long rested on the labor and resourcefulness of immigrants‚Äìvoluntary and involuntary, free and slave‚Äìand that those who most loudly denounce a ‚Äúnation without borders‚Äù are likely descendants of immigrants who were themselves harassed for their origins, faith and lifeways at some point in the past. We would do well to recognize that in a global economy such as ours, where the movement of people and goods are the lifeblood of our sustenance, a nation‚Äôs security is best maintained not by walling itself off but by lifting the prospects‚Äìand thereby creating political allies‚Äìof working people around the world.",1
Sweden on the Brink? Police Force Pushed to Breaking Point by Violence amid Migrant Influx,"Sweden on the Brink? Police Force Pushed to Breaking Point by Violence amid Migrant Influx Lizzie Stromme, Express, November 1, 2016 
Sweden is on the brink of becoming a lawless state as the police force is losing the battle against unprecedented levels of crime and violence amid a growing migrant crisis. 
The Scandinavian country is facing an existential crisis with on average three police officers handing in their resignations a day. 
If the alarming trend continues, and police officers continue to resign more than 1,000 officers will have quit the service by New Years. 
Since the migrant crisis began last summer, Sweden has been hit by a series of brutal crimes and violent incidents . 
In 2015 alone Sweden, with a population of 9.5 million, received over 160,000 asylum applications and the country is expected to take as many as 190,000 refugees, or two per cent of the population, by the end of 2016. 
Since the Second World War Sweden has prided itself on helping migrants who cross their borders despite some moves to the political right in recent years. 
But police have now admitted the force has reached breaching point as more than 50 areas in the country have now been placed on a ‚Äúno-go zone‚Äù list . 
In February a report from Sweden‚Äôs National Criminal Investigation Service announced there were 52 areas where officers would not cope with the levels of crime being committed . 
Sex assaults , drug dealing and children carrying weapons were just some of the incidents mentioned in the report. 
In September, Swedish officials were forced to add another three areas to the list. 
Now the Police Association have said they need at least 200 new officers to regain control in the south-east of the country. 
Thomas Stjernfeldt, from the region‚Äôs police association, told SVT : ‚ÄúWe are missing extremely many officers in the operational sector, right now we need 200 more officers to be added to the force to establish a reasonable working environment in the southeast of G√∂taland.‚Äù 
G√∂taland is one of the regions in the country that has been hit hard by the car fire attacks, which have been occurring throughout Sweden. 
On Monday, Express.co.uk reported a number of the arsonist attacks in the city of V√§xj√∂, in G√∂taland, had been committed by frustrated migrants . 
Currently there are more than 6,000 suspected crimes that are unsolved in the area and 400 of these cases are suspected to be rapes, murder or attempted murder. 
Mr Stjernfeldt said the figures are alarming and police officers are constantly forced to work overtime in an attempt to solve the reported crimes. 
The Police Association admitted it fears the public will lose faith in the force and their ability to protect citizens if the situation is not resolved. 
The union‚Äôs call for more resources echoes National Police Commissioner Dan Eliasson‚Äôs February warning, where he said he needed a further 4,100 officers and specialist staff to reestablish law and order in Sweden.",1
Turnbull to Propose Law That Bans Boat Asylum Seekers from Australia Permanently,"Turnbull to Propose Law That Bans Boat Asylum Seekers from Australia Permanently News, October 31, 2016 
Federal Labor will look closely at the government‚Äôs new tough stance on refugees but says it‚Äôs ridiculous that some banned from Australia won‚Äôt ever be allowed to visit for business, accusing Malcolm Turnbull of pandering to One Nation. 
The opposition has not entirely ruled out the government‚Äôs proposed lifetime ban on asylum seekers who arrive by boat, instead saying it will look at the legislation before coming up with a position. 
Under the plan, all adults sent to offshore immigration centres on Nauru and Papua New Guinea‚Äôs Manus Island would be prevented from ever entering Australia, even as tourists or on business, regardless of whether they‚Äôre found to be refugees or not. 
The coalition is ramping up its attack on Opposition Leader Bill Shorten for not publicly stating a position on the ban within 24 hours of its announcement. 
‚ÄúThis bloke is weak,‚Äù former immigration minister Scott Morrison told Sydney radio station 2GB. 
Mr Shorten says Labor will look closely at the legislation ‚Äúwhen the government can be bothered releasing it‚Äù. 
‚ÄúIt seems ridiculous to me that a genuine refugee who settles in the US or Canada and becomes a US or Canadian citizen is banned from visiting Australia as a tourist, businessman or businesswoman 40 years down the track,‚Äù he said. 
He also took aim at the prime minister, saying the Mr Turnbull of old would never have proposed this to keep the right-wing extremists in his party happy. 
‚ÄúHe‚Äôs earning the praise of Pauline Hanson‚ÄìI hope he‚Äôs proud of that.‚Äù 
Meanwhile, One Nation is both applauding and claiming a win over the government‚Äôs tough stance. 
Its Queensland senator Malcolm Roberts said the government was ‚Äúdancing to our tune‚Äô, while leader Pauline Hanson put it more bluntly. 
‚ÄúRefugees are not welcome here,‚Äù she told the Seven Network. 
Concerns have also been raised the ban may contravene article 31 of the international refugee convention, which states signatory nations shall not penalise refugees for illegal entry when they have come directly from a territory where their life or freedom was threatened. 
Amnesty International says the outrageous and unnecessary law discriminates against people seeking safety based on their mode of arrival, a clear breach of Australia‚Äôs obligations. 
‚Äú‚ÄúThis is yet another layer of cruelty in Australia‚Äôs already deliberately abusive policy,‚Äù refugee campaigner Ming Yu Hah said. 
But Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull insists the plan does not contravene the convention. 
‚ÄúWe have taken legal advice and we are satisfied it is within power and consistent with our international obligations,‚Äù he told reporters in outback South Australia on Monday. 
Greens leader Richard Di Natale told ABC radio he was hopeful that ‚Äúif Labor shows a little bit of courage on this issue‚Äù, it could be struck down. 
Mr Turnbull said the government has spoken to just one of the 11 Senate crossbenchers about the proposal, which it will put to parliament next week. 
Independent senators Derryn Hinch and Nick Xenophon separately said they supported the government in general but wanted to see details. 
Meanwhile, the debate comes as the UN Special Rapporteur on the human rights of migrants, Francois Crepeau, is due to arrive on Tuesday to look at the government‚Äôs migration policies and laws. 
Earlier 
The Federal Government wants to pass laws to make sure no asylum seekers who tried to come to Australia by boat, even those found to be refugees, can ever enter the country. 
The Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull today told media ‚Äúthe door to Australia is closed to those who seek to come here by boat with a people smuggler‚Äù. 
‚ÄúThat absolutely unflinching, unequivocal message has to be loud and clear,‚Äù he told reporters in Sydney this morning. 
The government will ask parliament to ban everyone who was sent to Nauru or Papua New Guinea‚Äôs Manus Island for offshore immigration processing after July 19, 2013‚Äìthe date Labor prime minister Kevin Rudd declared: ‚ÄúAs of today, asylum seekers who come here by boat without a visa will never be settled in Australia.‚Äù 
The ban would apply whether or not they were found to be refugees and extends to all types of visas, including tourist and business categories. Asylum seekers aged under 18 at the time they were sent to Nauru or Manus Island would be exempt. 
The minister would also have power to lift the bar if they believe it‚Äôs in the public interest for someone to be allowed in to Australia. 
Immigration Minister Peter Dutton described the plan as one of the government‚Äôs strongest moves, building on the success of its border protection policies over the past three years. 
It sent a clear message that Australia was not an option. 
‚ÄúThere are still people, advocates in Australia and elsewhere, who are messaging to people on Nauru and Manus, that at some stage you‚Äôll come to Australia,‚Äù Mr Dutton said. 
‚ÄúThose people are living in false hope and it cannot continue.‚Äù The legislation would reflect the coalition‚Äôs long-standing policy and what it understood to be Labor‚Äôs position, Mr Turnbull said. 
He expects the opposition will give ‚Äúunequivocal support‚Äù to the move. 
Foreign Minister Julie Bishop earlier this morning said the government would enshrine in law what had been a longstanding policy. 
‚ÄúThis is a tough message we are sending to the people smuggling syndicates and those who pay people smugglers to try and enter Australia,‚Äù she told ABC TV. 
‚ÄúWe are sending a strong message to those currently in Manus and Nauru, if they are found to be owed protection, they will not be resettled in Australia. If they‚Äôre not found to be owed protection, they should return home.‚Äù 
This would even apply to accepted refugees later attempting to visit via tourist visa, she said. 
‚ÄúI will never forget 1200 people that we know of drowned at sea coming to Australia under these people smuggling networks,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúWe cannot have situations where people are drowning at sea and that is why we are working through the case load, the cohort of people who are on Manus and Nauru, to find third country resettlements for them and if they want to stay in PNG and in Nauru, they can be resettled there.‚Äù 
Mr Turnbull expects Labor and its leader Bill Shorten will support the laws, saying they are ‚Äúentirely consistent with his party‚Äôs stated public position‚Äù. 
Mr Dutton added Australia has ‚Äòdiscussions ongoing with a number of countries‚Äô on the issue of resettling the asylum seekers already at Naru and Manus. 
Deputy Opposition Leader Tanya Plibersek said it was too soon to determine if Labor would support the bill. 
‚ÄúWhat I‚Äôd say is it‚Äôs a distraction from Peter Dutton‚Äôs hopeless mismanagement of his portfolio,‚Äù she told reporters on the Gold Coast. 
‚ÄúIt is extraordinary that, three years on, the government has not found third countries to resettle those people who are in limbo on Manus Island and Nauru.‚Äù She said Mr Dutton needed to find a permanent resettlement option for these people left in limbo.",1
"Behind 2016‚Äôs Turmoil, a Crisis of White Identity","Amanda Taub, New York Times, November 1, 2016 
Call it the crisis of whiteness. 
White anxiety has fueled this year‚Äôs political tumult in the West: Britain‚Äôs surprising vote to exit the European Union, Donald J. Trump‚Äôs unexpected capture of the Republican presidential nomination in the United States, the rise of right-wing nationalism in Norway, Hungary, Austria and Greece. 
Whiteness, in this context, is more than just skin color. You could define it as membership in the ‚Äúethno-national majority,‚Äù but that‚Äôs a mouthful. What it really means is the privilege of not being defined as ‚Äúother.‚Äù 
Whiteness means being part of the group whose appearance, traditions, religion and even food are the default norm. It‚Äôs being a person who, by unspoken rules, was long entitled as part of ‚Äúus‚Äù instead of ‚Äúthem.‚Äù 
{snip} 
‚ÄúIt‚Äôs fundamentally about ‚Äòwho are we?‚Äô‚Äù said Eric Kaufmann, a professor of politics at Birkbeck College, University of London. ‚ÄúWhat does it mean to be part of this nation? Is it not ‚Äòour‚Äô nation anymore, ‚Äòour‚Äô meaning the ethnic majority? 
‚ÄúThese kinds of questions are really front and center, even though they‚Äôre not necessarily verbalized.‚Äù 
The questions can seem like a sudden reversal after decades of rising multiculturalism, through the civil rights movement in the United States and the European Union‚Äôs opening up of borders. 
{snip} 
White people‚Äôs officially privileged status waned over the latter half of the 20th century with the demise of discriminatory practices in, say, university admissions. But rising wages, an expanding social safety net and new educational opportunities helped offset that. Most white adults were wealthier and more successful than their parents, and confident that their children would do better still. 
That feeling of success may have provided a sort of identity in itself. 
But as Western manufacturing and industry have declined, taking many working-class towns with them, parents and grandparents have found that the opportunities they once had are unavailable to the next generation. 
That creates an identity vacuum to be filled. 
‚ÄúFor someone who is lower income or lower class,‚Äù Professor Kaufmann explained, ‚Äúyou‚Äôre going to get more self-esteem out of a communal identity such as ethnicity or the nation than you would out of any sort of achieved identity.‚Äù 
{snip} 
A recent Gallup study found that Mr. Trump‚Äôs supporters tend to earn above-average incomes for their communities, but also tend to live in majority-white areas where children are likely to be worse off than their parents. 
{snip} 
The formal rejection of racial discrimination in those societies has, by extension, constructed a new, broader national identity. The United States has a black president; London has a Muslim mayor of Pakistani descent. 
But that broadening can, to some, feel like a painful loss, articulated in the demand voiced over and over at Trump rallies, pro-Brexit events and gatherings for populist parties throughout Europe: ‚ÄúI want my country back.‚Äù 
The mantra is not all about bigotry. Rather, being part of a culture designed around people‚Äôs own community and customs is a constant background hum of reassurance, of belonging. 
The loss of that comforting hum has accelerated a phenomenon that Robin DiAngelo, a lecturer and author, calls ‚Äúwhite fragility‚Äù‚Äìthe stress white people feel when they confront the knowledge that they are neither special nor the default; that whiteness is just a race like any other. 
Fragility leads to feelings of insecurity, defensiveness, even threat. And it can trigger a backlash against those who are perceived as outsiders. 
{snip} 
For decades, the language of white identity has only existed in the context of white supremacy. When that became taboo, it left white identity politics without a vocabulary. 
If you are a working-class white person and you fear that the new, cosmopolitan world will destroy or diminish an identity you cherish, you have no culturally acceptable way to articulate what you perceive as a crisis. 
Some of these people have instead reached for issues that feel close to their concerns: trade, crime, the war on drugs, controlling the borders, fear of Islamist terrorism. All are significant in their own right, and create very real fears for many people, but they have also become a means to have a public conversation about what society‚Äôs changes mean for white majorities. 
{snip} 
There will not likely be a return to the whiteness of social dominance and exclusive national identity. Immigration cannot be halted without damaging Western nations‚Äô economies; immigrants who have already arrived cannot be expelled en masse without causing social and moral damage. And the other groups who seem to be ‚Äúcutting in line‚Äù are in fact getting a chance at progress that was long denied them. 
Western whites have a place within their nations‚Äô new, broader national identities. But unless they accept it, the crisis of whiteness seems likely to continue.",1
"Black Turnout Soft in Early Voting, Boding Ill for Hillary Clinton","Black Turnout Soft in Early Voting, Boding Ill for Hillary Clinton Jeremy Peters et al., New York Times, November 1, 2016 
African-Americans are failing to vote at the robust levels they did four years ago in several states that could help decide the presidential election, creating a vexing problem for Hillary Clinton as she clings to a deteriorating lead over Donald J. Trump with Election Day just a week away. 
{snip} 
The reasons for the decline appear to be both political and logistical, with lower voter enthusiasm and newly enacted impediments to voting at play. In North Carolina, where a federal appeals court accused Republicans of an ‚Äúalmost surgical‚Äù assault on black turnout and Republican-run election boards curtailed early-voting sites, black turnout is down 16 percent . White turnout, however, is up 15 percent. Democrats are planning an aggressive final push, including a visit by President Obama to the state on Wednesday. 
But in Florida, which extended early voting after long lines left some voters waiting for hours in 2012, African-Americans‚Äô share of the electorate that has gone to the polls in person so far has decreased , to 15 percent today from 25 percent four years ago. 
The problems for Democrats do not end there. In Ohio, which also cut back its early voting, voter participation in the heavily Democratic areas near Cleveland, Columbus and Toledo has been down, though the Clinton campaign said it was encouraged by a busy day on Sunday when African-American churches led voter drives across the state. 
{snip} 
The Clinton campaign believes it can close the gap, especially in North Carolina and Florida, by Election Day. And Democrats are seeing substantial gains in turnout for other key constituencies like Hispanics and college-educated women, which have the potential to more than make up for any drop-off in black voting.

It‚Äôs Harder for Clinton Supporters to Respect Trump Backers Than Vice Versa,"It‚Äôs Harder for Clinton Supporters to Respect Trump Backers Than Vice Versa John Gramlich, Pew Research, November 1, 2016 Given the rancorous tone and often highly personal nature of this year‚Äôs presidential campaign, supporters of Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump might be expected to hold similarly negative views of one another. But a new Pew Research Center survey finds that Clinton backers‚Äìparticularly highly educated ones‚Äìhave more difficulty respecting Trump supporters than the other way around. Nearly six-in-ten registered voters who back Clinton (58%) say they have a ‚Äúhard time‚Äù respecting someone who supports Trump for president; 40% say they have ‚Äúno trouble‚Äù with it. Nearly the opposite is true among Trump supporters, with 56% saying they have no trouble respecting someone who backs Clinton and 40% saying they do have trouble with it. Among Clinton supporters, those with a college degree have a harder time respecting someone who prefers Trump than those who have not graduated from college. About two-thirds (66%) of college graduates who back Clinton say they have a hard time, compared with a narrower majority (53%) among Clinton supporters who have not completed college. White women who back Clinton also are particularly likely to say they have difficulty respecting those who favor Trump: 68% say this, compared with a smaller share of white men (59%) and fewer nonwhites.

This Professor Devotes Her Life to Countering Dangerous Speech. She Can‚Äôt Ignore Donald Trump‚Äôs.,"Loading Posted on November 2, 2016 This Professor Devotes Her Life to Countering Dangerous Speech. She Can‚Äôt Ignore Donald Trump‚Äôs. Colby Itkowitz, Washington Post, October 24, 2016 
When Susan Benesch began looking at how speech could incite mass violence, her research took her to far-flung places like Kenya and Burma. 
Lately, she‚Äôs been unable to ignore a case study at home in the United States. 
The American University law professor and Harvard University faculty associate has grappled for months with whether Donald Trump‚Äôs rhetoric constitutes dangerous speech as she has come to define it. She has examined election-year speech before, but only abroad where the risks of mass atrocities were great. 
But in the past week, with Trump claiming that the election system and the media are rigged against him, his messages have the type of undertone that increases the risk of violence between groups, she said. 
Benesch, 52, has dedicated the past six years of her life to developing and testing a framework for identifying dangerous speech. To rise to that level, at least two of these five indicators must be true: A powerful speaker with a high degree of influence over the audience. The audience has grievances and fears that the speaker can cultivate. A speech act that is clearly understood as a call to violence. A social or historical context that is propitious for violence, for any of a variety of reasons, including long-standing competition between groups for resources, lack of efforts to solve grievances or previous episodes of violence. A means of dissemination that is influential in itself, for example because it is the sole or primary source of news for the relevan t audience. 
‚ÄúTrump‚Äôs speech is very difficult in the sense that he is so often slippery with it,‚Äù Benesch said in a recent interview. ‚ÄúThe meaning is so often ambiguous.‚Äù 
But when Trump said his supporters could use the Second Amendment against Hillary Clinton, ‚Äúit seems to me impossible that people didn‚Äôt understand that as a reference to violence,‚Äù she said. Or when he suggested that Clinton and President Obama were founders of the Islamic State, something he alluded to again at Wednesday‚Äôs final debate, that was a ‚Äúhallmark of dangerous speech to describe an in-group member as the enemy,‚Äù she said. 
And now, with Trump trafficking in the conspiracy theory that if he loses the election it will be because of a rigged system against him, he‚Äôs definitely laying the groundwork for potential unrest after the balloting. Direct incitement of violence is illegal, but Trump falls short of actually calling for any kind of civil disobedience. 
Because of that, it‚Äôs still a gray area that surrounds whether Trump does use dangerous speech. 
‚ÄúTrump may well be undermining the extent to which his supporters trust the essential institutions and practices of U.S. democracy,‚Äù Benesch said. ‚ÄúSome of them‚Äìthose who are most susceptible to being inflamed by such messages‚Äìmay therefore be more likely to commit violence. However, the United States is not in danger of mass intergroup violence, in my view. It is deeply irresponsible, though, since it can undermine some Americans‚Äô belief in our own democratic institutions, which can make them more susceptible to dangerous speech going forward.‚Äù

Poll: How Millennials View BLM and the Alt-Right,"Poll: How Millennials View BLM and the Alt-Right Susan Page and Karina Shedrofsky, USA Today, October 31, 2016 
Most Millennials have a positive view of the Black Lives Matter movement, a USA TODAY/Rock the Vote Millennial Poll finds, but attitudes are more mixed about the less well-known alt-right. 
In the survey of Americans 18 to 34 years old, 58% say they have a favorable opinion about Black Lives Matter, an activist movement that grew from protests over the shooting deaths of unarmed African Americans. Among blacks, an overwhelming 81% have a favorable view, including 50% who are ‚Äúvery favorable.‚Äù Just 14% of blacks have an unfavorable opinion. 
Whites have a positive impression of the movement by 53%-39%, Hispanics by 64%-31%, and Asian Americans by 54%-40%. 
{snip} 
The online poll of 1,299 young adults, including an over-sample of minorities, was taken Oct. 21-24 by Ipsos Public Affairs. {snip} 
The alt-right movement, which includes groups on the far right, has gained attention recently because of the support for Donald Trump by some white supremacists and anti-Semites. But it is much less well-known among Millennials. Nearly half of those surveyed, 45%, say they don‚Äôt know enough about the alt-right to have an opinion of it, compared with just 8% who say that of Black Lives Matter. 
Among those who express an opinion, 34% say they have a favorable opinion of the alt-right, 21% an unfavorable one. 
Among whites, the favorable-unfavorable divide is 33%-19%. Among African Americans, it is 31%-27%. Among Hispanics, 46%-23%. Among Asian Americans, 37%-23%.

"Hence, This Is Racist","Charles H.F. Davis III, Inside Higher Ed, November 1, 2016 
{snip} 
The recent case involving a first-generation Latina student , Tiffany Mart√≠nez, at Suffolk University, is but one example. An accomplished undergraduate, published journal author and McNair scholar, Mart√≠nez wrote a personal blog post titled ‚ÄúAcademia, Love Me Back.‚Äù In her heartfelt plea, Mart√≠nez first recounts an experience she described as both disrespectful and invalidating and then explains that a sociology professor accused her of plagiarism, not privately, but in front of the entire class. The professor‚Äôs claim was further illustrated by emphatic written statements on her paper such as ‚Äúthis is not your word‚Äù and ‚Äúplease go back and indicate where you cut and paste.‚Äù 
One such comment was written in the margin near the word ‚Äúhence,‚Äù which the professor had circled, an important detail, given Mart√≠nez merely used it as an appropriate transition to connect two related sentences. Was it that surprising to Mart√≠nez‚Äôs professor that she knew how to appropriately use a transitional word? 
Although some may dismiss this as a minor incident, Mart√≠nez reminds us of the internalized racism and self-doubt resulting from years of educational violence. Like the many students of color from whom we hear similar stories in our campus climate assessments , what transpired for Mart√≠nez was yet another debilitating and painful experience of marginalization.

It is imperative that our colleagues stop being surprised when students of color are able to thoughtfully articulate themselves in their writing and in class discussions. {snip}

White Students Start Whites-Only Group to Wreck White Racism,"White Students Start Whites-Only Group to Wreck White Racism Quincy Clarke, Campus Reform, November 2, 2016 
A number of white Pomona College students formed a new club called ‚ÄúWe‚Äôve Got Work To Do: White People for Deconstructing Whiteness.‚Äù The club, open to students from all five of the Claremont Colleges, aims to ‚Äúwork on owning our racism, deconstructing our Whiteness, and to engage in movement & action toward dismantling White Supremacy.‚Äù 
‚ÄúWhite people at the 5C‚Äôs: we‚Äôre all racist. we‚Äôre all microaggressive. [W]e are all not only complicit in, but actively perpetuating white supremacy,‚Äù states an advertisement for the group. ‚ÄúPretending that we are not racist and hoping that no one will discover our racism really doesn‚Äôt cut it. [W]e need to ACTIVELY be doing work to deconstruct our whiteness (and holding our peers accountable in doing the same).‚Äù 
‚ÄúRecognizing that White identity is a self-fashioned, hierarchical fantasy, Whites should attempt to dismantle Whiteness as it currently exists,‚Äù explains the group‚Äôs Facebook page , quoting Ian Haney L√≥pez, a leading racial justice scholar. ‚ÄúWhites should renounce their privileged racial character, though not simply out of guilt or any sense of self-deprecation. Rather, they should dismantle the edifice of Whiteness because this mythological construct stands at the vortex of racial inequality in America.‚Äù

The Ruthlessly Effective Rebranding of Europe‚Äôs New Far Right,"The Ruthlessly Effective Rebranding of Europe‚Äôs New Far Right Sasha Polakow-Suransky, Guardian, November 1, 2016 
In April 2002, Jean-Marie Le Pen stunned all of Europe by defeating the socialist candidate, Lionel Jospin, in the first round of the French presidential election, and advancing to the final round between the top two candidates. Terrified by the prospect of a far-right victory, the French left‚Äìincluding communists, Greens and the Socialist party‚Äìthrew their support behind the incumbent president, Jacques Chirac , a pillar of the centre-right establishment who had served as mayor of Paris for 18 years before becoming president in 1995. This electoral strategy effectively isolated Le Pen‚Äôs Front National (FN), depicting it as a cancerous force in the French body politic. 
Two weeks later, on 5 May, Chirac won the election with an astronomical 82% of the vote, trouncing Le Pen by the biggest margin in a French presidential election since 1848. Raucous celebrations spilled into the streets of Paris. ‚ÄúWe have gone through a time of serious anxiety for the country‚Äìbut tonight France has reaffirmed its attachment to the values of the republic,‚Äù Chirac declared in his victory speech . Then, speaking to the joyous crowds in the Place de la R√©publique, he lauded them for rejecting ‚Äúintolerance and demagoguery‚Äù. 
But May 2002 was not, in fact, a moment of triumph. Rather it was the dying gasp of an old order, in which the fate of European nations was controlled by large establishment parties. 
Jean-Marie Le Pen was an easy target for the left, and for establishment figures such as Chirac. He was a political provocateur who appealed as much to antisemites and homophobes as to voters upset about immigration, drawing his support largely from the most reactionary elements of the old Catholic right. In other words, he was a familiar villain‚Äìand his ideology represented an archaic France, a defeated past. Moreover, he did not seriously aim for power, and never really came close to acquiring it; his role was to be a rabble-rouser and to inject his ideas into the national debate. 
Europe‚Äôs new far right is different. From Denmark to the Netherlands to Germany, a new wave of rightwing parties has emerged over the past decade-and-a-half, and they are casting a much wider net than Jean-Marie Le Pen ever attempted to. And by deftly appealing to fear, nostalgia and resentment of elites, they are rapidly broadening their base. 
Le Pen‚Äôs own daughter is a prime example of the new ambitions of the right: unlike her incendiary father, Marine Le Pen is running a disciplined political operation and has already proven that her party can win upwards of 40% of the vote in regions from Calais in the north to the C√¥te d‚ÄôAzur in the south. She and her Danish and Dutch counterparts are not‚Äìas some on the left would like to believe‚Äìneo-Nazis or inconsequential extremists with fringe ideas lacking popular appeal. 
These parties have built a coherent ideology and steadily chipped away at the establishment parties‚Äô hold on power by pursuing a new and devastatingly effective electoral strategy. They have made a very public break with the symbols of the old right‚Äôs past, distancing themselves from skinheads, neo-Nazis and homophobes. They have also deftly co-opted the causes, policies and rhetoric of their opponents. They have sought to outflank the left when it comes to defending a strong welfare state and protecting social benefits that they claim are threatened by an influx of freeloading migrants. 
They have effectively claimed the progressive causes of the left‚Äìfrom gay rights to women‚Äôs equality and protecting Jews from antisemitism‚Äìas their own, by depicting Muslim immigrants as the primary threat to all three groups. As fear of Islam has spread, with their encouragement, they have presented themselves as the only true defenders of western identity and western liberties‚Äìthe last bulwark protecting a besieged Judeo-Christian civilisation from the barbarians at the gates. 
These parties have steadily filled an electoral vacuum left open by social democratic and centre-right parties, who ignored voters‚Äô growing anger over immigration‚Äìsome of it legitimate, some of it bigoted‚Äìor simply waited too long to address it. 
They have shed some of the right‚Äôs most unsavoury baggage while responding to both economic anxiety and fear of terrorism by blending a nativist economic policy‚Äìmore welfare, but only for us ‚Äìand tough anti-immigration and border security measures. Their message is beginning to resonate widely with a fearful population that believes the liberal governing elite no longer listens to them. 
Brexit was just the start. Europe‚Äôs new far right is poised to transform the continent‚Äôs political landscape‚Äìeither by winning elections or simply by pulling a besieged political centre so far in its direction that its ideas become the new normal. And when that happens, groups that would never have contemplated voting for a far-right party 10 years ago‚Äìthe young, gay people, Jews, feminists‚Äìmay join the working-class voters who have already abandoned parties of the left to become the new backbone of the populist right. 
On 6 May 2002, one day after revellers filled the streets of Paris to celebrate Chirac‚Äôs historic victory, the flamboyant and iconoclastic leader of the Dutch far right, Pim Fortuyn, was gunned down by a radical animal rights activist as he emerged from a radio interview. His assassin later claimed that he had killed Fortuyn to stop him from using Muslims as ‚Äúscapegoats‚Äù. In national elections nine days later, Fortuyn‚Äôs eponymous party‚Äìthe Pim Fortuyn List‚Äì became the second largest in the Netherlands with 17% of the vote. 
Fortuyn, a former communist and openly gay man who boasted of sleeping with Muslim immigrants while calling for a ban on Muslim immigration, was an electrifying figure in a country known for its staid politics. His time in the limelight was short but transformative. 
It was Fortuyn who blazed the trail for the new generation of far-right leaders across Europe. He may not have intended to be a pioneer, but his brand of plain-spoken political incorrectness and his depiction of Islamic culture as a ‚Äúbackwards‚Äù and reactionary threat to the hard-won progressive values of western Europe would provide a potent template for a modernised far right. His ideological inheritors in Dutch politics, as well as the revamped Front National in France, the Danish People‚Äôs Party and Germany‚Äôs Alternative f√ºr Deutschland have all emulated Fortuyn in their own ways. 
Fortuyn proved that the winning argument for the European far right was not a US-style appeal to conservative religious values, but rather to claim it was ‚Äúdefending secular, progressive culture from the threat of immigration,‚Äù argues Merijn Oudenampsen of Tilburg University. The Netherlands was a perfect laboratory for this new strategy because, unlike France, it did not have a strong contingent of religious traditionalists opposed to women‚Äôs liberation and gay rights. 
Before founding his own party in 2002, Fortuyn had tried to join an establishment centre-right party, the People‚Äôs Party for Freedom and Democracy (VVD), in the late 1990s. The party‚Äôs then-leader, Frits Bolkestein, who had been one of the first figures to speak critically about immigration in the early 1990s, remembers Fortuyn as a talented but inflammatory politician. ‚ÄúHe had a thoroughly theatrical personality, and that played in his favour,‚Äù said Bolkestein, now in his 80s, from his office overlooking the canals of Amsterdam. ‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt want him to be in my parliamentary group, so I cold-shouldered him . . . He would have acted as a fragmentation bomb.‚Äù 
Fortuyn took his explosive rhetoric elsewhere and, by creating a new type of far-right politics in progressive garb‚Äì‚Äúa form of xenophobia ideally suited to a nation that prides itself on its tolerance,‚Äù as a New Yorker profile once described it‚Äìhe redirected the entire national debate in a way that has endured long after his death. 
Two years after Fortuyn was killed, the Netherlands was traumatised by another political assassination. Early one morning in November 2004, the filmmaker Theo van Gogh was murdered by a young Dutch-Moroccan, Mohammed Bouyeri, who shot van Gogh eight times, slashed his throat and then pinned a letter to his chest with a knife. The letter was a death threat aimed at the Somali-born Dutch parliamentarian Ayaan Hirsi Ali ‚Äìa vocal critic of Islam who was soon placed under the protection of the Dutch security services. 
The two assassinations shook the Netherlands to its core and catapulted a little-known and theatrically coiffed politician, Geert Wilders , to popularity as an ideological successor to Fortuyn. Wilders had also flirted with Bolkestein‚Äôs VVD, beginning his political career as a staffer in the party office. In late 2004, he split off and formed his own. With Hirsi Ali in hiding, he quickly became the most prominent anti-immigration voice in the country‚Äìand has remained so ever since. 
For those who cared to look, the political ground had already begun to shift. Six months before Chirac‚Äôs trouncing of Le Pen and Fortuyn‚Äôs assassination, Denmark had an election. On its surface the result was not a historical watershed; the centre-right Venstre party ousted the Social Democrats, handing power from one establishment party to the other. What had changed was that the Danish People‚Äôs Party, which had campaigned on an overtly anti-immigrant platform, took 12% of the vote‚Äìtransforming it into a kingmaker in parliament. 
Unlike France, which revelled in its triumph over the FN, or the Netherlands, where the remains of Fortuyn‚Äôs party failed to become a real parliamentary force, the DPP immediately became a serious player with real influence over policy. And it was not only taking votes from the right; it was also attracting disgruntled social democratic voters who felt that their leaders had abandoned them. 
The DPP had crafted a social and economic policy that was in many ways more socialist than that of the Social Democrats‚Äìpromising better health care, better care for the elderly, and more subsidised housing. As the outgoing Social Democratic prime minister Poul Nyrup Rasmussen told me in 2002, a few months after his defeat: ‚ÄúThey took a part of our rhetoric and tried to sell it as a new package to the people, and with some success, one may say.‚Äù Back then, Naser Khader, a Danish member of parliament who immigrated from Syria as a child, argued that ‚Äúthe best way to weaken the DPP is to give them influence‚Äù. He was wrong. 
The headquarters of the Front National sits on a quiet street in the unassuming Paris suburb of Nanterre, near a car repair shop and a Portuguese restaurant. Only when you approach the grey building with its mostly closed blue shutters do the armed guards come into view. In her modest second-floor office, surrounded by books and a cloud of vape smoke, Marine Le Pen explained earlier this year how she transformed a party previously known for calling the Holocaust a ‚Äú detail of history ‚Äù into a genuine contender for the presidency. 
‚ÄúVoluntarily or not, he gave ammunition to our adversaries,‚Äù Le Pen said of her father. But she insisted that she has now cleaned house. ‚ÄúI fired them all . . . all those people who expressed an ideology or held views that I found unacceptable.‚Äù 
Julien Rochedy, a 28-year-old who headed the FN‚Äôs youth wing but has since left the party, told me that he believes the changes are real. Whereas the party‚Äôs former leader used to pepper his speeches with lines that made Jews‚Äô hair stand on end, today, if someone tells a racist joke within the party, ‚Äúyou will be attacked straight away,‚Äù Rochedy said. ‚ÄúThere is such self-discipline these days. They are so afraid they‚Äôll be accused once again of being antisemitic or racist.‚Äù 
Still, the party‚Äôs detractors continue to level the same charges at the FN, which outrages Marine Le Pen . ‚ÄúToday our adversaries no longer have that ammunition, and they repeat on loop‚Äù old tropes about fascists and racists. ‚ÄúAt a certain point this argument loses its force,‚Äù she continued, ‚Äúbecause voters see clearly that there‚Äôs absolutely nothing in our platform that remotely resembles fascism or racism.‚Äù 
Le Pen has done more than kick out the most blatant racists and antisemites. She has consciously crafted a campaign designed to appeal to voters of the centre and left‚Äìand other constituencies‚Äìwho could never have imagined voting for her father‚Äôs Front National. 
As Le Monde‚Äôs Olivier Faye has written , she is ‚Äútrying to erase another image that has stuck to the skin of the FN‚Äìthat of homophobia‚Äù. And it is working: a survey showed that her share of the vote among married gay couples in the 2015 regional elections was over 32%‚Äìup from just 19% in a similar poll from 2012. 
As Le Pen has filled her inner circle with more and more openly gay advisers and party leaders, she has also made her pitch to Jewish voters more explicit: ‚ÄúFor a lot of French Jews, the FN appears to be the only movement that can defend them from this new antisemitism nourished in the banlieues ,‚Äù Le Pen told me. ‚ÄúIn a very natural way they have turned toward the FN, because the FN is capable, I think, of protecting them from that.‚Äù 
Among French voters threatened by the country‚Äôs new diversity, rejection of a multicultural society increasingly takes the form of longing for a bygone era. And peddling nostalgia is the centrepiece of many new far-right parties across Europe . In France, Marine Le Pen has promised a return to a time when the French had their own currency and monetary policy, when there were fewer mosques and less halal meat, when no one complained about nativity scenes in public buildings, and when French schools promoted a republican ethos of assimilation. 
‚ÄúA growing number of French people feel uncomfortable in their own country,‚Äù the prominent philosopher, Alain Finkielkraut , declared in January during a debate with the centre-right presidential candidate Alain Jupp√©‚Äìwho has taken a less strident line on Islam and migration than his rival Nicolas Sarkozy. Finkielkraut depicted contemporary France as a country of halal butchers and tea shops filled only with men, pleading that ‚Äúthe public good isn‚Äôt in the clouds, it‚Äôs made from tangible things‚Äìthe French of Proust and Montaigne . . . the Jardin du Luxembourg and the cows of Normandy‚Äù. 
Finkielkraut, a 67-year-old Jewish liberal, is not an admirer of the Front National, but Marine Le Pen‚Äôs deliberate appeals to Jews and gay people have given political expression to an argument that he first made more than a decade ago‚Äìthat the left, with its indulgence of Islam, poses a greater threat to France than the far right. After Chirac ‚Äúsaved‚Äù the republic from Jean-Marie Le Pen in 2002, Finkielkraut watched the celebrations in the streets and warned that the victors were the real danger: ‚ÄúThe future of hate is in their camp and not in the camp of those nostalgic for Vichy,‚Äù he wrote, ‚Äú . . . in the camp of the multicultural society and not that of the ethnic nation‚Äìin the camp of respect, not that of rejection.‚Äù 
Fourteen years later, after the terrorist attacks on Charlie Hebdo, the Bataclan and Nice, Finkielkraut is even more certain he was correct. ‚ÄúAnti-racism today frequently serves as a pretext for not seeing the true danger that threatens us,‚Äù he told me when we met in his Paris apartment this summer. While he is still no fan of the FN, he believes it has changed and argues that it ‚Äúshould be resisted, but for what it is today and not what it was in the past, and not in the name of anti-fascism‚Äù. The French must, he insisted, ‚Äúavoid simplistic analogies with the 1930s. We must not mistake what era we live in. Europe doesn‚Äôt only have demons; it also has enemies, and it needs to know how to fight those enemies.‚Äù 
He worries that integration has been such a failure that France will have to ‚Äúreconquer‚Äù its ‚Äúlost territories‚Äù‚Äìby which he means the suburbs surrounding Paris. ‚ÄúIntegrating people is not telling them ‚ÄòYou are how you are and we are how we are‚Äô . . . Integration means making them an integral part of our civilisation.‚Äù And if that doesn‚Äôt happen, he warned darkly, ‚Äúat best we‚Äôll have secession and at worst civil war‚Äù. Continued immigration from Muslim countries, he argues, is nothing less than the ‚Äúplanned demise of Europe‚Äù. 
Across the country, nostalgia for an older, whiter France has become a potent political force. In the southern city of B√©ziers, Mayor Robert M√©nard, a former Trotskyist who cofounded the press freedom group Reporters Without Borders , is seeking to place a moratorium on the opening of kebab shops and has renamed a street after one of the French officers who joined a failed coup against De Gaulle in 1961 to prevent Algerian independence . M√©nard comes from a family of pieds-noirs , French settlers in Algeria. He regards the Evian accords that ended the Algerian war as a ‚Äúcapitulation‚Äù, and those who tried to preserve French Algeria as heroes. 
This nostalgia has an unmistakable appeal, but not necessarily for the sort of voters one might expect. Whereas young Britons overwhelmingly voted to remain in the EU and the elderly voted to leave, in France it is the opposite. According to Julian Rochedy, the former FN youth leader, appeals to nostalgia work better with the young in France‚Äìwho dream of an era they never witnessed‚Äìthan with the old, who lived through the era Marine Le Pen promises to restore. It is older voters, Rochedy argues, who are the greatest obstacle to Le Pen‚Äôs victory. ‚ÄúThey are afraid of leaving the euro,‚Äù he says. ‚ÄúThey are afraid of huge changes.‚Äù Rochedy is convinced that the FN will never win simply by fetishising the past. ‚ÄúThey just want to go back 30 years,‚Äù he said of his erstwhile colleagues. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a discourse that doesn‚Äôt at all take into account the world as it is and what France has become.‚Äù 
Even if Le Pen cannot win over enough older voters for her to become president, there is one ageing constituency that has already moved significantly to the right‚Äìthe former members of what used to be the largest communist party in western Europe. 
As the French Communist party collapsed, its supporters were left rudderless. According to Andrew Hussey, a Liverpool-born academic who teaches in Paris, the technocratic leaders of the Socialist party‚Äì many of them graduates of the ultra-elite Ecole Nationale d‚ÄôAdministration‚Äì‚Äúare so disconnected from ordinary people‚Äù that even former Marxists won‚Äôt consider voting for them. Distrustful of the establishment and searching for a state that protects them, many have turned to the FN. ‚ÄúI think you‚Äôve got a big political question here about who looks after you,‚Äù Hussey said. ‚ÄúThis is a very communist way of thinking.‚Äù 
Le Pen knows that she is attracting these people. Many of her supporters ‚Äúused to be socialists, but they aren‚Äôt any more‚Äù, she told me. Although she prefers to avoid the phrase welfare state‚Äì‚ÄúThat‚Äôs a socialist concept,‚Äù she insisted‚ÄìLe Pen has appealed directly to this yearning for a large and nurturing state that fights for the common man and not the rich. 
‚ÄúI defend fraternity‚Äìthe idea that a developed country should be able to be able to provide the poorest with the minimum needed to live with dignity as a human being. The French state no longer does that,‚Äù she told me. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre in a world today in which you either defend the interests of the people or the interests of the banks.‚Äù And she has seen results. She points to the northern Pas-de-Calais region. ‚ÄúIt was socialist-communist for 80 years,‚Äù she says. ‚ÄúI won 45%.‚Äù 
At the same time as Marine Le Pen was working to ‚Äúde-demonise‚Äù the FN, the leaders of the Dutch far right successfully seized the mantle of radicalism by positioning itself as the only force that dares to challenge an out-of-touch political establishment, and the only party willing to speak out about what many voters fear: extremist Islam. 
Geert Wilders and his Party for Freedom (PVV) have surpassed the Dutch Labour party to take up a close second place in polls ahead of the March 2017 election. Last September, Wilders declared that Europe was facing an ‚Äú Islamic invasion ‚Äù‚Äìthe sort of comments that landed him in court this week on charges of inciting racial hatred , which he dismisses as an attack on freedom of expression. 
The presence of ‚Äúmasses of young men in their 20s with beards singing ‚ÄòAllahu Akbar‚Äô across Europe‚Äù, Wilders warned at the peak of last year‚Äôs refugee crisis, posed a dire threat to ‚Äúour prosperity, our security, our culture and identity‚Äù. Across the country, grassroots groups responded to Wilders‚Äôs warning, attempting to block the resettlement of asylum seekers in their towns. Last October, Klaas Dijkhoff, the deputy minister responsible for refugee resettlement, arrived for a visit to the tiny north-eastern village of Oranje, where the Dutch government had decided to place 700 refugees. Outraged locals blocked the road leading to town, kicked Dijkhoff‚Äôs car and tore off its rearview mirrors. A few days later, near Utrecht, an asylum centre was attacked by masked men with smoke bombs and fireworks. 
In the decade following the assassinations of Fortuyn and Van Gogh, the integration of Muslim immigrants became the most divisive issue in Dutch politics. Suddenly, Turkish and Moroccan-born Dutch citizens became ‚ÄúMuslims‚Äù. And as the public debate over Islam and migration grew even more hostile, even the most basic forms of visible religious observance‚Äìwearing the hijab, buying halal meat, fasting during Ramadan‚Äìbecame politically loaded. 
The Dutch Labour MP Ahmed Marcouch, who came to the Netherlands from rural Morocco when he was 10, recounted how controversies have erupted everywhere from supermarkets to classrooms. It is a jolt to the traditionally liberal Netherlands when teenage girls tell their male teachers they can‚Äôt shake hands, or that they fast and pray while many other Dutch kids are out drinking and having sex. As Marcouch remarked, it runs against everything that Dutch youth culture promotes. 
Wilders‚Äôs PVV has capitalised on this cultural angst by using simple and deliberately brash slogans about immigration, crime, and refugees‚Äìone of his latest memes is simply ‚ÄúDe-Islamise‚Äù‚Äìto win over voters who feel that everything familiar to them is slipping away. 
By framing its anti-migrant politics as a battle against imperious elites and political correctness, the PVV has been able to capitalise on a panoply of grievances, from anger over asylum seekers to Euroscepticism. Meanwhile, many causes of the radical left‚Äìincluding anti-racism and anti-colonialism‚Äìhave now become establishment thinking in the Netherlands. ‚ÄúIdealism has been bureaucratised,‚Äù argues the journalist Bas Heijne, who writes a column in the liberal daily newspaper NRC Handelsblad. ‚ÄúAnd when the establishment enforces universalism, you react against it.‚Äù That‚Äôs why there is such a strong anti-PC tone to the Dutch right: do not tell us what to say, what to celebrate and who we must live next to. 
Just as Marine Le Pen‚Äôs FN has become a huge presence on social media in France, the right is in the midst of colonising the Dutch media. Geen Stijl (‚ÄúNo Style‚Äù), a popular Breitbart-style news site featuring abrasive articles and videos, encourages its best and angriest commenters to visit mainstream news sites and go on the attack. ‚ÄúIt is massively important,‚Äù says Tilburg University‚Äôs Merijn Oudenampsen, ‚Äúlike a social movement‚Äù. The site began as a blog dedicated to those who felt politically homeless after Fortuyn‚Äôs murder, and has since become a ubiquitous presence in Dutch public debate, with an army of ‚Äúreactors‚Äù on Twitter. According to Oudenampsen, some politicians have told him that Geen Stijl is the first site they check in the morning. 
The right‚Äôs newfound media clout has also helped shape what the journalist Kustaw Bessems, from the leftwing Volkskrant newspaper, sees as a new, inverted, form of political correctness. In the old days, he says, there were taboos enforced by the left: badmouth immigrants and ‚Äúyou were immediately called a racist and extreme right and basically pressured to shut up‚Äù. Now, it‚Äôs the other way around. ‚ÄúAs soon as you say anything other than ‚Äòimmigration is a problem‚Äô or ‚ÄòIslam is the cause of terrorism‚Äô . . . the thought police immediately jump on your neck to correct you.‚Äù 
A Dutch government official who focuses on security issues complained that even as the integration of Muslim immigrants and the threat of radical Islam had become the most heated and polarising issues in the Netherlands, almost none of the feverish public debate was informed by knowledge of Islamism or terrorism. While politicians fan the flames of fear, the official said, ‚Äúthe economists look for the economic roots of the problem, sociologists look for social causes and the anthropologists try to explain jihadi culture‚Äìbut none of them have any idea about theology‚Äù. Even scholars of radicalisation tend to study today‚Äôs extremists through the historical lens of the European radical left‚Äìwhich does little to explain what leads a small number of young Muslim men such as Van Gogh‚Äôs killer, Mohamed Bouyeri, to devote themselves to the cause of jihad. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs easy to be a Marxist,‚Äù the security official quipped. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs fucking hard to be a salafi.‚Äù 
As the perception that the state is helpless to prevent the radicalisation of Muslim teenagers deepens and the fear of terrorism increases, so does the share of voters who are newly receptive to the far right‚Äôs tirades about ‚ÄúIslamisation‚Äù. These days it is not only anti-migration activists pushing back against the bureaucratised consensus. There are also many disappointed progressives‚Äìthe people who saw the cultural victories of the 1960s and 1970s as major battles that had long since been won, making sexual freedom, feminism and gay rights an unquestioned part of Dutch society. Suddenly those old victories seem tenuous. ‚ÄúThere is a sense that, ‚ÄòWe are welcoming and then they do this,‚Äô says Bas Heijne. ‚ÄúThey have been terribly let down in their good intentions.‚Äù And in such an environment, traditionally leftist constituencies such as gay people and Jews feel threatened‚Äìand some have become reflexively suspicious of Muslims. 
The stereotype that observant Muslims hate gay men and lesbians has become so entrenched in the Netherlands that neither side can fathom evidence to the contrary. When the Moroccan-born Labour MP Ahmed Marcouch first joined in Amsterdam‚Äôs legendary gay pride parade , he was, as he puts it, the ‚Äúfirst hetero-active Muslim‚Äù to participate. The gay community feared violence from extremists; conservative Muslims were baffled and angry. Both groups concluded, ‚ÄúOh, maybe Marcouch is homosexual too,‚Äù he says with a laugh. Neither group could imagine a straight Muslim doing what he did. 
But public displays of solidarity such as Marcouch‚Äôs are rare. Among openly gay couples and religious Jews alike, there is a palpable fear of being targeted by homophobic or antisemitic young Muslim men. Much as in France, this fraught atmosphere has made far-right parties seem a palatable option for groups who would never previously have considered voting for them. 
In Amsterdam earlier this year, I had several meetings with a staunch Jewish supporter of Wilders‚Äôs PVV, who insisted on remaining anonymous. He described his own backing for the far right in terms that echoed Alain Finkielkraut. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs an outdated reflex for Jews to always say the problem is the extreme right,‚Äù he told me. ‚ÄúWe have new enemies and we need new ideas.‚Äù 
The experience of his own family during the second world war has convinced him that Europe‚Äôs capacity for murderous violence is always lurking beneath the surface. ‚ÄúAnne Frank wasn‚Äôt betrayed by the Germans,‚Äù he argued. ‚ÄúBut by Dutch people. Regular Dutch.‚Äù Jews need to find new allies in a new war, he argues, because they will never be safe. ‚ÄúThe trains for the Jews will always come,‚Äù he added, ominously. ‚ÄúI‚Äôd rather be wrong than be too calm and end up on the trains.‚Äù 
He is not unsympathetic to the plight of European Muslims, and told me that he even sees parallels with the persecution his own family faced. ‚ÄúIf I were a Muslim in Europe at this moment I‚Äôd be very uneasy,‚Äù he admitted. ‚ÄúIf Europeans regain their manhood, it could be bad. It‚Äôs the history of Europe to treat foreigners terribly. We Jews know that.‚Äù 
For that reason, he argues, Muslims should regard Wilders as a lesser evil. ‚ÄúEvery Muslim should be happy Geert Wilders exists. If someone else channelled these hateful feelings it would be much worse,‚Äù he told me menacingly. ‚ÄúWilders is civil. He is a democrat. He is not the new Hitler.‚Äù 
To Frits Bolkestein, who led the Netherlands‚Äô centre-right VVD in the 1990s‚Äìand was briefly Wilders‚Äô boss when he was a young aide in the party office‚Äìthe rise of the far right is as much about class as it is about Islam. The Dutch Labour party, he argues, gave up on its working-class base: ‚ÄúThey made a major mistake,‚Äù he says of his old rivals, with a tinge of satisfaction. Faced with ‚Äúthe choice between the foreign-born and the labour classes, they chose the foreign-born ‚Ä¶ and they‚Äôve paid for it dearly‚Äù. Current polls project that the party will drop from the 36 seats it now holds (out of 150) to just 10. 
Marcouch concedes that, like the old leftists in France, many former Labour voters now back Wilders. Moreover, he says, they still live in the very neighbourhoods that families such as his own moved into in the 1980s, as many white Dutch families were moving out. ‚ÄúTheir message to the Labour party,‚Äù he said, ‚Äúis: ‚ÄòYou ignored us. You let it happen.‚Äô‚Äù 
The Danish People‚Äôs Party has been seeking out such voters for years, and they have masterfully leveraged anti-immigrant sentiment to siphon away the Social Democrats‚Äô traditional base‚Äìpeople who fear that the ‚Äúbread will be buttered more thinly‚Äù, as the Danish journalist Lars Trier Mogensen puts it. 
The DPP has effectively combined anti-immigrant rhetoric with a strong pro-welfare message that stresses quality health benefits and good care for the elderly. S√∏ren Espersen, the DPP‚Äôs deputy leader, doesn‚Äôt think that former Social Democrats will ever go back. ‚ÄúWhen one of those takes the step to vote for us, it is a very, very huge step he is taking,‚Äù he says of voters who supported the Social Democrats all their lives. ‚ÄúAnd why should he go back? I mean, to come over this first hurdle of voting for us, then he‚Äôs done it.‚Äù 
The Social Democrats first began to lose their dominance in and around the major cities in the 1990s, with many of their votes going to the DPP. One of those places is the small satellite town of Herlev, about 10 miles west of Copenhagen. The 41-year-old Social Democratic mayor, Thomas Gyldal Petersen, has lived there all his life, and he is adamant that controlling immigration numbers is the only way to reverse his party‚Äôs political misfortunes. 
For Gyldal Petersen, the key to successful integration is a demographic balance. As soon as a school or housing estate becomes majority immigrant‚Äìor majority unemployed‚Äìhe says, problems start to arise. He blames his own party‚Äôs leaders: ‚ÄúMayors in the 80s, they were warning, something is going wrong, you have to change.‚Äù But the party leadership ‚Äúshut their eyes‚Äù, he says. 
Then came the Muhammad cartoons . In 2005, the editors at Jyllands-Posten, Denmark‚Äôs largest newspaper, invited a group of well-known cartoonists to draw the prophet. The initial response was underwhelming, but within a few months‚Äìthrough a combination of diplomatic pressure, a dismissive response from the Danish government, and a concerted campaign by local imams‚Äìthe cartoons became a full-blown crisis, with boycotts of Danish products and violent protests occurring throughout the Middle East. Danes who had never contemplated voting for the DPP now saw their embassies on fire and death threats against some of their best-known journalists. Suddenly, the DPP‚Äôs platform was making sense. They had warned that Muslims were extremists in waiting, and now those warnings seemed to come true. Politicians such as Naser Khader, who once warned that giving the DPP influence would weaken them, found themselves moving steadily to the right of the political spectrum. When Khader founded a new organisation called ‚ÄúDemocratic Muslims‚Äù in the wake of the cartoon controversy, he received death threats. 
Those at the top of the Social Democrats are now taking a tough stance, too. Earlier this year the party leader, Mette Frederiksen, went to Stockholm to meet with fellow Scandinavian social democrats. There she gave a speech that rattled her colleagues. ‚ÄúWe social democrats must accept that there is a clash,‚Äù she declared. ‚ÄúIt is a very strong part of our identity that we help when people need help . . . but just as strong is our value that we must have a well-functioning welfare state.‚Äù Frederiksen continued: ‚ÄúMy position is that a universally funded Scandinavian welfare state with free and equal access to healthcare, education and social subsidies is not compatible with an open immigration policy.‚Äù 
But in its zeal to get tough on migration, Denmark has damaged its international reputation as a bastion of progressivism‚Äìthe sort of place that Bernie Sanders liked to mention at campaign rallies. In January, just three months after the refugee crisis peaked, Denmark passed what became known as the ‚Äú jewellery law ‚Äù, which stipulated that any refugees carrying valuables worth more than 10,000 kroner (¬£1,200) would have them confiscated to fund the cost of accommodating asylum-seekers. Editorial pages and columnists across the world lined up to condemn the law. According to Kenneth Kristensen Berth, a babyfaced MP for the DPP, it was about deterrence. ‚ÄúThe goal was, of course, that we should try to tell people that they should not seek asylum in Denmark,‚Äù he said. The jewellery provision was a minor part. ‚ÄúMore important is the fact that many people will be waiting longer for family reunification, like waiting three years,‚Äù he added. And it wasn‚Äôt just the DPP and government who supported it‚Äìthe Social Democrats voted for it, too. 
Bent Melchior, Denmark‚Äôs 87-year-old former chief rabbi, was outraged. He bristled at the suggestion that refugees are rich because they flee with some money in their pockets. He would know: although Denmark is always hailed for saving its Jews during the second world war, it is often forgotten that Danish Jews paid fishermen huge sums to ferry them across to Sweden. Melchior‚Äôs family paid the equivalent of ‚Äúalmost a year‚Äôs rent of a six-room flat‚Äù just for his own passage. ‚ÄúDenmark is not a poor country, for God‚Äôs sake,‚Äù Melchior says. ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs food for everybody here, and even if we get a few tens of thousands more people, there will still be food for everybody.‚Äù 
The road that led a centre-left party to support such a law has been long and tortuous, but the trajectory has been clear. The Scandinavian welfare system has always been premised on solidarity, with everyone paying their fair share and receiving what they deserve. As the country has become more diverse, some of the trust sustaining it has broken down. There has been abuse of the system by immigrants, and there has been even more tabloid fearmongering depicting immigrants as cheats and leeches sucking the system dry. But the larger issue, as the Oxford economist Paul Collier has argued, is the growing unwillingness of natives to subsidise those seen as the foreign poor. 
Herlev‚Äôs mayor does not oppose asylum, but he insists that the numbers have to be capped. ‚ÄúWe have to help refugees, and we have to take refugees to Denmark in a number that we can help. If the balance tips, the welfare society cannot hold together,‚Äù Petersen warns. 
But such balance may only help so much. Aydin Soei, a Danish sociologist and the son of immigrants from Iran, believes there is a larger blind spot in the thinking of the Danish government‚Äìone that native Danes who have never been on the receiving end of the state‚Äôs integration policy have failed to see. ‚ÄúA lot of refugees were just parked on social welfare instead of [the state] recognising their education and their skills,‚Äù Soei told me, citing the case of his own mother, who arrived in Denmark with a physics degree that was regarded as worthless. ‚ÄúIf your motivation is to create a liberal society where the individual can create a good life for him or herself, then you would have solved this problem years ago,‚Äù he argues. 
Instead the state has effectively provided newcomers with an allowance and keys to an apartment, and ignored them‚Äìassuming that its work was done. The problem, Soei claims, is that there is no political incentive to integrate asylum seekers into the job market. ‚ÄúIt doesn‚Äôt have consequences for the politicians . . . because they don‚Äôt have the right to vote.‚Äù Either way, it plays into the DPP‚Äôs argument. ‚ÄúImmigrants can‚Äôt do right,‚Äù said Gyldal Petersen. ‚ÄúWhen they‚Äôre unemployed they‚Äôre a burden to society. When they‚Äôre in a job, they just stole the job from a Dane.‚Äù 
Whether or not Marine Le Pen wins next year‚Äôs French election or Wilders‚Äô PVV becomes the largest party in the Netherlands, the new far right is not going away. The reflex among many establishment parties‚Äìand media institutions‚Äìhas been to dismiss them, sideline them or mock them. Others, however, have begun to mimic them in an effort to win their old voters back. 
Rhetoric might, in the long run, matter more than election results. When I spoke again recently with the Jewish Wilders supporter from Amsterdam, he was convinced that the battle has in some ways already been won‚Äìregardless of the outcome of next year‚Äôs elections. ‚ÄúThe PVV has shifted the whole political discussion to the right. The Labour party is saying almost exactly the same thing Wilders said five years ago,‚Äù he told me. ‚ÄúYou can have a lot of influence in politics by steering the debate.‚Äù 
If traditional political parties want to win, they must first abandon the old strategy of marginalising populist movements and instead engage them on the merits‚Äìand flaws‚Äìof their policies and counter their messages of fear. 
Not least among the lessons of Brexit was that, for millions of disaffected voters, immigration is just one more thing nobody asked them about . This is what makes the issue an especially potent weapon: it combines the resentful energies of nativism, economic instability, and hatred of a remote and unaccountable political elite. And the leaders of the new far right have learned to wield it effectively. They know better than to let themselves be dismissed, as Jean-Marie Le Pen was, as antisemites or racists. 
In France, the new majority Marine Le Pen hopes to build is strikingly similar to the coalition that brought the Brexit campaign victory. In a park near Calais‚Äô castle-like town hall in May, Samuel and Pascal, activists from a group named Retake Calais, railed against the town‚Äôs centre-right mayor. They blamed her for the growth of the sprawling, trash-strewn tent city known as the Jungle, which sat three miles east of the town until it was dismantled this month . ‚ÄúThose who govern us are completely against us. The illegals, who aren‚Äôt French, can do whatever they want,‚Äù they told me. For them, even Marine Le Pen is ‚Äútoo soft‚Äù. 
If resettlement programmes take refugees away from Calais to other parts of France, as dozens of buses have in the past week since the destruction of the camp, they would not be any happier. ‚ÄúThey‚Äôre sending them to all the little villages in France,‚Äù says Samuel. After they start to open businesses and bring family members, ‚Äúin two years the village will be dead‚Äù. 
About a mile down the road, the Calais ferry terminal lies behind layers of tall steel fences and coiled barbed wire. I met Rudy Vercucque and Yohann Faviere, the local FN leaders, on a blustery morning in June outside the terminal, where they were anxiously awaiting a visiting EU dignitary. Giant seagulls circled and squawked above as they denounced the mayor, Natacha Bouchart, a member of Sarkozy‚Äôs Republicans party. 
‚ÄúIt‚Äôs she who has permitted this,‚Äù Vercucque, a portly 35-year-old, fumed. And it was Sarkozy, he reminded me, who negotiated the notorious Le Touquet accords , effectively moving the British border to where we were standing. Calais depends on British tourism and revenues are down sharply. The result is crippling economic and social malaise: ‚ÄúFind a doctor who wants to move to Calais. Find a surgeon who wants to move to Calais,‚Äù Vercucque exclaimed. ‚ÄúYou work your whole life, you pay off your house and you lose money. It‚Äôs intolerable.‚Äù Their support locally may have once been a protest vote, said Faviere, but no longer. ‚ÄúToday we really have people who adhere to our ideas.‚Äù 
Vercucque was more blunt: ‚ÄúWe say out loud what people think deep down.‚Äù",1
Call for Action to Tackle Growing Ethnic Segregation Across UK,"Call for Action to Tackle Growing Ethnic Segregation Across UK Anushka Asthana and Nazia Parveen, Guardian, November 1, 2016 
Politicians must urgently tackle the increasing ethnic polarisation of many of Britain‚Äôs towns and cities, according to a senior academic, as he revealed figures showing how rapidly the white British population had dwindled in urban ‚Äúpockets‚Äù across England. 
Prof Ted Cantle, who first authored a report into community cohesion after a series of race riots in 2001, said his new study showed that in the most extreme cases the white British population had more than halved in two decades. 
Cantle, who co-authored the report with Prof Eric Kaufmann at Birkbeck, University of London, told the Guardian that white British families should be encouraged to remain in ethnically diverse areas to reduce the trend. 
He warned that segregated societies ‚Äúbreed intolerance and prejudice‚Äù, adding: ‚ÄúAnd we know the opposite is true‚Äìthere is a huge amount of research that shows any form of contact does break down stereotypes.‚Äù 
The leading academic said he would not describe the trend as white flight because that indicated that people were moving because of ethnic mixing, while this research only established the facts and not necessarily the causes. 
‚ÄúWhite people are leaving urban areas in a disproportionate number‚Äìand they avoid moving to diverse areas when they do move. But we can‚Äôt say that is white flight because the motivations are many and various,‚Äù he said, arguing it could be to do with the dream of a place in the country or an older cohort retiring to rural communities. 
But he said interviews he had carried out in recent years as part of the study had highlighted a sense among some white British people that an area they had lived in was ‚Äúno longer for them‚Äù. 
In one case a community cohesion officer in Yorkshire told Cantle he was the first Asian to move into a particular street and that within three years virtually every white British family had gone. ‚ÄúSome of those families made no bones about it, they said they are moving out because ‚Äòthey‚Äô are moving in,‚Äù he said. 
The research looked at two existing studies and drew from census data from 1991, 2001 and 2011‚Äìexamining the figures in a way that has not been done before. 
The report authors stressed that the findings were nuanced, with more diversity in some areas, and different ethnic groups mixing together. 
However, when looking at the white British population compared with all other ethnicities together it found increasing polarisation, with the steepest decline in the white population in ‚Äúurban pockets‚Äù where the numbers were already well below the national average. 
Some of the largest declines were in Slough, where the white population fell from 58.3% to 34.5%, in Birmingham, where it went from 65.6% to 53.1% and in Leicester, where it decreased from 60.5% to 45.1%. 
In one London borough, Newham, the figure was just 16.7% in the latest data set. 
But the study found even more marked changes when it examined the figures at ward level. In one part of the Blackburn and Darwen authority area 7.8% of the population was white British, down from 42.3% in 1991. 
Smaller council areas in Birmingham saw similar declines, from 40.4% to 11.2% in Small Heath and from 30.7% to 7.2% in Handsworth. The trend was repeated in parts of Bradford, Luton and across London boroughs. 
Green St East in Newham had a white British population of 31.6% in 1991. Twenty years later is had declined to just 4.8%. While Southall Green, in Ealing, went from 18.9% to 4.6% in the same period. 
Meanwhile, there were only tiny changes in ethnic diversity in the most predominantly white areas, such as Barrow-in-Furness, mid-Devon, Bassetlaw and Mid Sussex. 
‚ÄúThe focus of policy needs to shift; this is not just about minorities,‚Äù said Cantle. ‚ÄúPoliticians and policymakers need to encourage white British residents to remain in diverse areas; to choose, rather than avoid, diverse areas when they do relocate, encouraging similar choices with respect to placing pupils in diverse schools; in other words to create a positive choice for mixed areas and a shared society.‚Äù 
Cantle called for ‚Äúsalesmanship‚Äù of the positive benefits of mixed areas, including the cultural choices, and activities. We‚Äôve never sold the idea that mixed communities are more exciting places with more going on,‚Äù he said, adding that after the Brexit vote there had been a bit of move in the opposite directions with the immediate surge in hate crime. 
But he also argued that some negative practices ought to be stamped out‚Äìincluding businesses recruiting workers from single, eastern European countries. 
The publication of the report triggered an immediate debate with experts claiming that the diversity in areas with fewer white British families meant segregation was the wrong description. ‚ÄúIt is simply wrong to suggest that inner cities have become more ‚Äòethnically segregated‚Äô. In fact, people are more likely to live near those of a different ethnicity than ever before. What is undoubtedly true is that more needs to be done to promote integration‚Äìand not just in the most diverse areas,‚Äù said the economist, Jonathan Portes. 
However, Cantle‚Äôs report argues that polarisation between the white British majority and other ethnic groups is a significant fact that requires urgent action. 
Cantle‚Äôs research comes after the government was accused of sitting on a major study into community cohesion by Dame Louise Casey. The study is thought to include some uncomfortable findings. 
Casey, whose report has been finalised, will warn that successive governments have failed to do enough to tackle the difficult issues raised by Cantle 15 years ago. 
She is expected to suggest that faith schools should make their pupils mix with children of other religions, in a report that she has promised will be ‚Äúmaking the difficult choices and telling the truth‚Äù. 
It is not clear why her review has not yet been published although sources have pointed out that much has changed since she was first appointed by the then prime minister, David Cameron, including the EU referendum result and a new government. The government insists the review will be out by the end of the year. 
Chuka Umunna MP, chair of the all-party parliamentary group on social integration, said the report from Cantle and Kauffman laid ‚Äúbare the striking pace of change in some of our communities‚Äù. 
In a foreward to the study, he argued there were consequences for policymakers. ‚ÄúIt is clear we cannot carry on with a laissez-faire approach to integration in our country. Integration is a two-way street and all parts of society have a role to play in preventing the UK becoming more fragmented. 
‚ÄúIf we fail to do so, we risk sleepwalking into a situation where the divisions exposed during the EU referendum campaign become deeper as we grapple with the challenges thrown up by globalisation.‚Äù",1
War on the Streets of Paris: Armed Migrants Fight Running Battles in the French Capital,"War on the Streets of Paris: Armed Migrants Fight Running Battles in the French Capital Nick Gutteridge, Express, November 2, 2016 
A migrant turf war erupted into violence on the streets of one of Paris‚Äô trendiest neighbourhoods early this morning as asylum seekers beat each other to a pulp with wooden clubs. 
The area around Stalingrad Metro station was turned into a refugee battleground as rival gangs of migrants set upon each other in shocking scenes of violence. 
Asylum seekers wearing hooded tops wielded makeshift clubs fashioned from lengths of wood which they used to bludgeon each other as horrified pedestrians looked on. 
The blood-curdling brawl erupted just yards from the Stalingrad Metro station, where a squalid migrant camp has popped up following the demolition of the Jungle. 
It was not immediately clear what sparked the early morning fight, but rival gangs of people smugglers have previously been involved in violent brawls in Calais. 
And despite the horrific brawl, a pro-migrant rally is apparently being organised to take place at the camp at 6pm tonight. 
The once peaceful neighbourhood, in Paris‚Äô 10th Arrondissement, used to be a popular area with tourists, boasting a lively nightlife scene bustling with restaurants and bars. 
But worried residents have revealed how it has become a no go zone in recent weeks following the establishment of the refugee camp, which has brought squalor and violence. 
Thousands of migrants‚Äìmostly from Sudan, Libya, Afghanistan, and Eritrea‚Äìhave pitched tents under the Metro station after the demolition of the Jungle hampered their attempts to reach Britain. 
French police have tried and failed on many occasions to clear the squalid squat, but asylum seekers simply keep on returning and reestablishing it. 
There are now nore than 2,500 migrants pitching up in the makeshift camp, with locals saying the eyesore is ruining their businesses and making life a ‚Äúliving hell‚Äù. 
Residents in the once popular district say that the squatters are now becoming increasingly violent and dangerous, with increased reports of muggings. 
Faisal, a shopkeeper, told the French daily Le Figaro that Stalingrad locals are living in fear, threatening the future of his business. 
He said: ‚ÄúThe stench of urine, faeces, and rubbish has made Stalingrad an insalubrious place to live. The place is dead ‚Äì no-one wants to come here anymore. People are afraid to go out and lock themselves in. 
‚ÄúI‚Äôm making less than ‚Ç¨60 (¬£53) a day. A few more weeks like this and I‚Äôll go bust! 
‚ÄúFrench people have been kind to them. I know they‚Äôre desperate, but the least they can do is respect the law and try and integrate into French society.‚Äù 
Jeanne, another Stalingrad resident, told Le Figaro the migrants had become increasingly violent towards locals. 
She said: ‚ÄúBrazen migrants are snatching jewellery and handbags off passers-by‚Äìthey‚Äôre even stealing bread. I‚Äôve seen them beat people up too.‚Äù 
Police have raided the camp some 30 times in the past year, and on Monday French president Fran√ßois Hollande vowed to close the camp for good. 
But within 24 hours of a police operation to move migrants on tents had sprung up again, showing the uphill battle authorities in the French capital face to shut down such illegal encampments. 
Furious locals have demanded that the camp be closed once and for all, describing how they have heard ‚Äúblood-curdling noises‚Äù coming from it in the middle of the night. 
Marie, who lives right next to the makeshift camp, told Le Figaro: ‚ÄúLife here has become unbearable. More than 2,500 squatters were evacuated in September, and now, less than two months later, they‚Äôre back. And now that the ‚ÄòJungle‚Äô camp has been closed, things are about to get even worse.‚Äù 
Another local, Monique, said that she was at ‚Äúa loss for words‚Äù and ‚Äúutterly distraught‚Äù over the situation. 
She said: ‚ÄúThe streets are littered with rubbish and faeces. We can hear blood-curdling screams coming from the camp in the middle of the night.",1
Beneath a Close Election Contest Lie Deep Rifts Among Groups,"Beneath a Close Election Contest Lie Deep Rifts Among Groups Gary Langer et al., ABC News, November 3, 2016 
Profound rifts among groups lie beneath the close presidential contest, underscoring the country‚Äôs fundamental political divisions not only by gender, education, race and ethnicity but also by factors ranging from religious belief to residential area. 
{snip} 
There‚Äôs a 22 point gender gap in the contest, nearly double the norm in elections since 1976. And that pales compared with other gaps‚Äì44 points between college- and non-college-educated whites, 65 points between whites and nonwhites, 66 points between rural and urban residents and 97 points between white evangelicals and likely voters who don‚Äôt profess a particular religion. 
{snip} 
Trump is doing less well with Republicans and GOP leaners who wanted someone else to win the nomination; he has 75 percent support in this group, with 15 percent going to Clinton, 7 percent to Johnson or Stein. Two factors mitigate the damage: leaning Republicans have grown more apt to say they supported Trump in the first place (47 percent, up from 40 percent in August), and there‚Äôs no slippage evident in turnout among leaning Republicans who preferred someone else for the nomination. 
{snip} 
Differences among groups abound, with one of the largest between evangelical white Protestants‚Äìa core Republican constituency‚Äìand those who profess no religion. The former back Trump by 77 to 19 percent; the latter, Clinton by 64 to 25 percent. The groups are identical in size, each making up 17 percent of likely voters. The gap between them is typical. 
{snip} 
The racial gap, while wide, is narrower than typical. Whites support Trump by 53 to 39 percent; nonwhites favor Clinton, 72 to 21 percent. But that 65 point divide is a bit smaller than the average in exit polls since 1976, 73 points, as well as 26 points smaller than the record racial gap, 91 points, in 1984. That‚Äôs mostly because of lower support for Clinton among nonwhites who are not black or Hispanic; 48 percent back her, versus 66 percent for Barack Obama in 2012. 
In a particularly prominent result in this election, gender and education continue to spell broad differences among whites. College-educated white women, consistently strong for Clinton all year, now back her by 59 to 32 percent. Non-college-educated white men, steadily one of Trump‚Äôs best groups, support him 64 to 26 percent. 
White men with a college degree continue to divide closely, making them a battleground group. Non-college-educated white women‚Äìthe largest of these groups, at 24 percent of likely voters‚Äìhave wavered in their support, generally for Trump but by varying margins. Lately, they look more settled on Trump, now by 61 to 33 percent.

"Race, Not Class, Dictates Republican Future","Francis Wilkinson, Bloomberg, November 1, 2016 
The class compositions of the Republican and Democratic parties keep evolving. {snip} 
A Pew Research Center report last month detailed the shift. 
Since 1992, the share of Democratic and Democratic-leaning registered voters with at least a college degree has increased sharply, from 21 percent to 37 percent. Among Republicans, 31 percent have at least a college degree, up only slightly from 28 percent in 1992. As a consequence, a greater proportion of Democrats than Republicans now have a college degree or more education. 
In the New York Times last week, political sage Thomas Edsall called this process the ‚ÄúGreat Democratic Inversion.‚Äù 
What these figures suggest is that the 2016 election will represent a complete inversion of the New Deal order among white voters. From the 1930s into the 1980s and early 1990s, majorities of downscale whites voted Democratic and upscale whites voted Republican. Now, looking at combined male and female vote totals, the opposite is true. 
A key word in Edsall‚Äôs analysis is ‚Äúwhite.‚Äù Stories about the disaffected working-class supporters of Donald Trump apply almost exclusively to white voters. Other working-class voters‚Äìblacks and Hispanics ‚Äìare poised to provide lopsided support to Hillary Clinton. 
{snip} 
There is no expansive, working-class rage in the U.S. There is white conservative rage (along with a more modest left-wing version). While it may burn brightest in deindustrialized America, conservative rage extends across class and educational demarcations, from blue collars to billionaires . 
This complicates the story of the parties switching class allegiances. For Democrats, it leaves them managing an increasingly unwieldy coalition extending from white cosmopolitan millionaires who send their kids to private schools to low-paid Hispanic service workers and black factory and office workers facing economic dislocation. {snip} 
Keeping that coalition pointed in the same general direction might be impossible without the dedicated efforts of the Republican Party. The GOP has proved incapable of breaking out of its racial straitjacket. So it has opted instead to tighten the straps around its torso. 
{snip} 
Republicans‚Äô constant struggle with racism in their ranks, and their recurring failure to resist the temptation to exploit it, eases pressure on the Democrats‚Äô sprawling coalition. The parties won‚Äôt fully exchange their class identities for the simple reason that working-class blacks and Hispanics can‚Äôt trust the GOP to represent them. 
If it doesn‚Äôt diversify and become more accommodating to nonwhites, the GOP will only grow crazier and scarier , and its effort to wield power with the support of a shrinking white base will become even more extreme. {snip}

Family Remembers Queens Sucker Punch Victim ‚ÄòHe Was The Best Man I Knew‚Äô,"Family Remembers Queens Sucker Punch Victim ‚ÄòHe Was The Best Man I Knew‚Äô CBS New York, October 2, 2016 
The NYPD is looking for a killer who walked up to a stranger and punched him for apparently no reason. 
Authorities are looking for two suspects in connection with the sucker punch attack of a Queens man just after midnight on June 26th. His family says he had taken a bus home after attending a Baltimore Orioles game. 
The NYPD released new surveillance video Wednesday of the assault, which police said happened outside 64-year-old Patrick Gorman‚Äôs home on the corner of Queens Boulevard and Main Street just after midnight on June 26. 
In the video, police said a man can be seen approaching Gorman and punching him in the head, knocking him to the ground. The man is then joined by a woman and calmly walks away as Gorman is seen struggling to get up. 
Gorman was taken to Jamaica Hospital, where he died nine hours later after suffering a stroke and brain hemorrhage. {snip} Patrick Gorman

Nigel Farage Fears Brexit ‚ÄòBetrayal‚Äô and Warns of ‚ÄòPublic Anger‚Äô Following Historic Article 50 Ruling,"Nigel Farage Fears Brexit ‚ÄòBetrayal‚Äô and Warns of ‚ÄòPublic Anger‚Äô Following Historic Article 50 Ruling Chris Kitching, Mirror, November 3, 2016 
Nigel Farage has warned fellow politicians that any attempt to block or delay Britain‚Äôs exit from the European Union will be met with untold anger from the public. 
In a statement released after the historic High Court ruling on Article 50 the interim Ukip leader said he fears a Brexit ‚Äúbetrayal‚Äù is on the horizon. 
The judges ruled that the government doesn‚Äôt have the power to trigger two-year exit process Article 50 without a vote by MPs. 
Farage campaigned vigorously for Brexit and declared the June 23 referendum Britain‚Äôs ‚Äúindependence day‚Äù after the shock result was confirmed. 
After the High Court ruling was announced on Thursday morning Farage said: ‚ÄúI worry that a betrayal may be near at hand. 
‚ÄúLast night at the Spectator Parliamentary Awards I had a distinct feeling that our political class, who were out in force, do not accept the 23rd of June Referendum result. 
‚ÄúI now fear that every attempt will be made to block or delay the triggering of Article 50 . 
‚ÄúIf this is so, they have no idea of the level of public anger they will provoke.‚Äù 
Three of England‚Äôs top judges gave the ruling after a costly three-day hearing. 
The Government immediately announced it would appeal to the Supreme Court. 
Ukip millionaire donor Arron Banks accused the ‚Äúlegal establishment‚Äù of ‚Äúdeclaring war on British democracy‚Äù. 
He added: ‚ÄúParliament voted six-to-one in favour of letting the people decide. 
‚ÄúThey didn‚Äôt get the answer they wanted, and now they‚Äôre going to use every dirty trick in the book to try to sabotage, delay or water down Brexit.‚Äù 
Ukip leadership hopeful Suzanne Evans blasted the judges and said the court ruling ‚Äúundermines democracy‚Äù. 
The former party chair urged the government to appeal. 
She wrote on Twitter : ‚ÄúHow dare these activist judges attempt to overturn our will? It‚Äôs a power grab & undermines democracy. Time we had the right to sack them. 
‚Äù Article 50 is an EU trap we must not fall in to. It will tie us into the EU for years. The government must appeal. People power must win.‚Äù 
Labour Leader Jeremy Corbyn said: ‚ÄúThis ruling underlines the need for the Government to bring its negotiating terms to parliament without delay. 
‚ÄúLabour respects the decision of the British people to leave the European Union. 
‚ÄúBut there must be transparency and accountability to parliament on the terms of Brexit . 
‚ÄúLabour will be pressing the case for a Brexit that works for Britain, putting jobs, living standards and the economy first.‚Äù 
Liberal Democrats Leader Tim Farron welcomed the ruling. 
He said: ‚ÄúGiven the strict two year timetable of exiting the EU once Article 50 is triggered, it is critical that the government now lay out their negotiating to Parliament, before such a vote is held.‚Äù",1

"‚ÄòGo Away, You Shouldn‚Äôt Be Here. Don‚Äôt Come Back‚Äô: The Corner of Yorkshire That Has Almost No White Residents","Loading Posted on November 3, 2016 ‚ÄòGo Away, You Shouldn‚Äôt Be Here. Don‚Äôt Come Back‚Äô: The Corner of Yorkshire That Has Almost No White Residents Sue Reid, Daily Mail, November 3, 2016 
From the window of her flat overlooking the canal path in a suburb of Dewsbury in Yorkshire, a blonde woman watches two female figures walking past as they chatter in a foreign tongue. 
Both the passers-by are covered in black Islamic gowns, only a glimpse of their eyes show from in the two gaps in the veils across their faces. 
They, like many Muslim women who live here, speak little or no English. Lots of them will have no contact with any person from another religion or culture. Almost all have been brought to the UK to wed the British men of south Asian heritage who have made this area their home. 
The wives have restricted lives: bringing up children, cooking for families, or going to women-only events at the huge local mosque run by the Deobandis, a powerful sect of Islam whose most outspoken preachers have urged followers not to mix with Christians, Jews or Hindus. 
We are in Savile Town, one of the most racially homogeneous parts of Britain: not because everyone is an indigenous Yorkshire man or woman, but exactly the opposite. 
In fact there are almost no white residents to be found in Savile Town. Astonishingly, a detailed breakdown of the last census of 2011 recorded that only 48 of the 4,033 people living here were white British. 
This would not surprise the blonde Lorraine Matthews, looking out at the ladies in burkas from her window. She is a 53-year-old dentist‚Äôs receptionist, one of the handful of white Britons left in Savile Town‚Äôs grid of terrace streets. Almost all the other residents, according to that census, have Pakistani or Indian backgrounds. 
Their forebears were enticed to Savile Town as cheap labour for back-breaking jobs in the woollen mills which had made Dewsbury a renowned textile town. 
These hard-working newcomers bought their own homes, and opened corner shops that sold burkas, prayer mats and perfumes that contained no alcohol, in line with the strictures of the Koran. 
Soon the new arrivals had built the mosque which is designed to accommodate 4,000 worshippers. Today, a Sharia court nearby‚Äìcriticised in a House of Lords report for discriminating against women in divorce and matrimonial disputes‚Äìdoes brisk business espousing the strict Islamic justice code. 
Even the lady selling ice creams from a van during the summer wears a burka, and the mobile butcher going round the streets offers only halal goat, lamb and ostrich. 
Stand in Savile Town, as I have, and you will see scores of boys in Islamic robes walking to and from lessons at the mosque‚Äôs madrasah school, where for hours at a time they rote-learn the Koran by heart. 
And, distressingly, every girl I saw‚Äìeven those of six and seven playing in the park‚Äìwas wrapped up in a hijab and shoulder-to-toe-gown lest a man glimpse her flesh. 
Eight of the nine pubs in the area have shut because there are hardly any local customers who drink alcohol. The hair salon, once giving stern perms to Yorkshire ladies, closed down long ago, the Western grocery and clothes shops, too. 
Needless to say, with nowhere to socialise or shop for what they like, the local white folk departed, first in a trickle, then a torrent. 
Savile Town was left to become an ethnic enclave. And it seems that this detachment from mainstream society had disturbing repercussions. For this small area has produced several young jihadists who disappeared to fight‚Äìand die as suicide bombers‚Äìfor Islamic State in the Middle East. 
(Mohammed Sidique Khan, the leader of the bombers who attacked London on July 7, 2005, was brought up nearby. He bade farewell to his pregnant wife at their terrace house before leading his fellow attackers to the capital to claim 52 innocent lives in explosions on Tube trains and buses.) 
Life in Savile Town was investigated earlier this year by Owen Bennett-Jones, the BBC‚Äôs former Pakistan correspondent, who threw light on the influence of the Deobandi movement over the Muslim population here. 
Interviewed for the Radio 4 programme was Mufti Mohammed Pandor, a civil servant and spokesman for the Deobandis. He arrived from India‚Äôs Gujarat in 1964 as a small child with his family. 
He lives near Savile Town, and would call himself a British Muslim. Yet he refused to let interviewer Bennett-Jones see his wife when the reporter visited the couple‚Äôs home, although she was permitted to make the tea in the kitchen. 
Pandor insists she is completely covered at almost all times, allowing her only to raise her veil for passport checks at airports. His family rarely watches British TV and says all music is un-Islamic. 
Despite being a religious adviser to two universities‚ÄìBradford and Huddersfield‚Äìhe told the BBC that Muslim men should only be permitted to enter higher education institutions to study and pray, and ‚Äònot to look at women‚Äô. 
‚ÄòIf Mohammed did not do it, we don‚Äôt do it,‚Äô Pandor told the BBC, saying the Deobandi are a ‚Äòback to basics‚Äô movement whose followers live in the style of the Prophet‚Äôs life, 14 centuries ago. 
You might dismiss such desperately backward thinking as being the preserve of a small outlandish sect, but the Deobandis run nearly half the 1,600 registered UK mosques, and train 80 per cent of all domestic Islamic clerics who, in turn, play a huge part in influencing the growing population of British Muslims. 
Perhaps it‚Äôs little surprise that the few indigenous Yorkshire people remaining in Savile Town feel somewhat beleaguered. 
Lorraine Matthews, in the house near the canal, is outspoken in her comments about the community in which she now lives: ‚ÄòI wouldn‚Äôt go out at night on my own as it is dangerous if you‚Äôre not from the Muslim community. It isn‚Äôt sensible for a woman to walk there after dark. The Asian lads gather on the corners, they make you feel intimidated because they don‚Äôt respect white women.‚Äô 
When I myself walked down South Street towards the mosque, figures in burkas peered out of their lace-curtained windows in surprise at seeing an uncovered woman‚Äôs face. 
I asked one tall teenager, wearing an Islamic cap and white robes over his jeans, for directions to the mosque entrance. His response was to spit at me and shout: ‚ÄòGo away, you shouldn‚Äôt be here. Don‚Äôt come back.‚Äô 
It is depressing to be confronted with such aggression. And I‚Äôve no doubt many Muslims, too, will feel distressed at such behaviour. Not all British followers of Islam wish to live in areas where people of other faiths or cultures might fear to tread. 
Yet in places such as Savile Town, the omens are not good. 
For however unpalatable it may be to British liberals, the fact is that many Muslims here only want to live with those from their own culture. 
Indeed, some of the few remaining non-Muslim residents say they are regularly targeted by members of the local Islamic community who want to buy their houses. 
Some have even received a knock on the door from complete strangers in religious robes offering wads of cash in plastic bags to purchase their homes. 
Yorkshire-born Jean Wood, 76, a church-goer, is one long-time resident who feels that she is being edged out. Her children beg her to move to an area where she can share her retirement with the kind of people she grew up with. 
At her neat home on the edge of Savile Town, she told me the tale of what happened a day after her husband died suddenly while sitting at the kitchen table. 
‚ÄòHe had not gone 24 hours when a Muslim neighbour pushed a note through the door saying she wanted to buy this house,‚Äô she remembers. ‚ÄòWe had lived here all our married life. I was grieving, although the note did not mention my loss. 
‚ÄòBut I gathered my strength. I phoned the number on the piece of paper and said my home was not for sale and never would be in my lifetime.‚Äô 
They were brave words, but‚Äìinevitably‚Äìthe Deobandis‚Äô spokesman Mufti Pandor views it differently. 
He described, on Radio 4, how ‚Äòwhite flight‚Äô ensued when his family came to Savile Town. ‚ÄòWho was going to buy the house next door to us?‚Äô said Pandor. ‚ÄòIt certainly wasn‚Äôt going to be a white guy . . . so my uncle bought it. Then there were two of us. So then guess what happened? The bloke opposite said: ‚ÄòBugger this, I‚Äôm going‚Äô‚Äìso he left.‚Äô 
It‚Äôs not hard to see why, with suspicions running deep on both sides of the cultural divide, Savile Town is, for good or bad, changing for ever.",1
Hundreds of Migrants Protest in Paris over Their Treatment by French Authorities,"Hundreds of Migrants Protest in Paris over Their Treatment by French Authorities Julian Robinson and Peter Allen, Daily Mail, November 3, 2016 
Migrants have staged a mass protest in Paris over their treatment by French authorities following the destruction of their makeshift camps. 
Hundreds of refugees sleeping rough in the French capital joined local activists to demonstrate close to their encampment near the Stalingrad Metro station. 
One man held up a sign saying ‚Äòhuman, no beast‚Äô as a man used a loud speaker to lead the march, which happened late last night. 
It came 24 hours after violence broke out at the site with gangs of men attacking each other using sticks as makeshift clubs. 
The fighting unfolded just hours after demolition workers supported by riot police began smashing up an illegal camp full of UK-bound migrants in Paris. 
It also came in the wake of the destruction of the Calais Jungle which saw refugees transported around the country. It is not yet known what caused the fight in Paris. 
There had already been scuffles on Monday as mainly Afghans and Eritreans tried to save their possessions during the raid, which started soon after 8am. 
It followed thousands of migrants arriving in the French capital following the razing of the Calais Jungle refugee camp last week. 
While some 5,000 Jungle residents agreed to be bused to resettlement centres around France, many others headed off independently, saying they still wanted to get to Britain. 
Up to 3,000 set up tents on the pavements around the Stalingrad Metro station, which is close to the Gare du Nord Eurostar hub in the north of Paris. 
Shortly before Monday‚Äôs clearance French president Francois Hollande said: ‚ÄòWe won‚Äôt tolerate the camps any longer.‚Äô 
Referring to the Paris clearance, Mr Hollande said: ‚ÄòWe are going to carry out the same operation as in Calais.‚Äô 
CRS riot police around Stalingrad said there would be a ‚Äògradual operation‚Äô which is likely to go on all week until all the camps are gone. 
Meanwhile, the first ever official centre for refugees in Paris is due to be opened by the city‚Äôs Socialist council later this week. 
The ¬£6m facility is also close to the Eurostar hub, and will have beds for 400 men. 
But local residents and business owners say it will attract people smugglers, and other criminals. 
Jean Brossard, who has been living in the area for 30 years, said: ‚ÄòNone of us asked for an immigrant centre on our doorsteps. 
‚ÄòEverybody in the area is complaining. If these men want to go to England, then send them to England.‚Äô 
Others have accused the Socialists of tokenism, saying they are simply opening the camps as a humanitarian gesture that will have no long term effect on Europe‚Äôs immigrant crisis. 
The official centre, which will include a football pitch, will only allow residents to stay for between five and 10 weeks, and is likely to shut down within two years. 
Another centre for women with children will also open in the Paris suburb of Ivry-sur-Seine later this year, or early next, but it too will only have a limited capacity of 350 temporary places. 
Meanwhile, French authorities have started transporting migrant children out of Calais to processing centres around France, amid tensions around the closure of the vast Jungle camp. 
Three buses carried a group of unaccompanied boys, mainly teenagers, out of the camp on Wednesday morning. 
French authorities transferred more than 5,000 adult migrants out of Calais last week, but the fate of its 1,500 unaccompanied children remained unclear. 
Migrants from the Middle East and Africa converged on the Jungle in hopes of crossing the English Channel to Britain. 
President Francois Hollande said this week that the children would be transferred within days to ‚Äòdedicated centres‚Äô where British officials can explore whether they have the right to UK asylum. 
Mr Hollande said the others would be put in the care of French child welfare services.",1
The French Fear Islamization but Do Nothing,"Posted on November 4, 2016 The French Fear Islamization but Do Nothing Guillaume Durocher, American Renaissance, November 2, 2016 Not even the Front National is prepared to act. 
In his classic study Democracy in America , Alexis de Tocqueville wrote about Southerners‚Äô attitudes towards the rapidly expanding population of Blacks: 
In the states of the South, they are quiet; they do not speak about the future to foreigners; they avoid explaining themselves with their friends; everyone is in denial about it even with themselves. There is something more frightening about the silence of the South than the noisy fears of the North. [1] 
Almost two centuries later, there is a similar attitude of denial among French politicians about the steady Afro-Islamization of France. Conservatives are happy to talk about ‚ÄúIslamic totalitarianism,‚Äù ‚Äúsecularism,‚Äù ‚Äúburkinis,‚Äù etc, but not the underlying problem, which is continued Muslim immigration. Socialists recognize the problem in private, but do nothing either to stop the flood of Africans and Muslims. There is something surreal about the situation. 
The most striking example of awareness combined with inactivity was provided recently by the publication of a book of exclusive interviews with our painfully uncharismatic and ineffectual president, the Socialist Fran√ßois Hollande. Among Mr. Hollande‚Äôs statements , one finds: On conservative politician Nadine Morano‚Äôs saying that France is ‚Äúa country of the white race‚Äù (quoting Charles de Gaulle): ‚ÄúI am convinced that, when one asks the French, the majority have her position. [. . .] They think: ‚ÄòWe are for the most part Whites. There are more Whites than others.‚Äô ‚Äù On Islamic immigration: ‚ÄúThere are at the same time things which work very well and the accumulation of potential bombs linked to a continuous immigration. Because it continues.‚Äù On the salience of race in politics: ‚ÄúThe Left cannot win on the theme of identity, but it can lose on the theme of identity.‚Äù On ethnic segregation and potential civil war: ‚ÄúHow can we avoid partition? Because that is really what is happening: partition.‚Äù 
Mr. Hollande recognizes that integration, let alone assimilation, is not happening and that ‚Äúat some point [immigration] will have to stop.‚Äù And yet, during his four years as president, he has done nothing to stop it. Instead, his government has radically increased the rate of naturalizations of foreigners , providing the flagging Socialists with thousands of new voters in time for national elections next spring. 
On the Right, we have the conservative party, now called ‚ÄúLes R√©publicains,‚Äù led by former president Nicolas Sarkozy. He knows racial problems well, having made a career from a sort of low-level race-baiting while, as president, actually letting more immigrants settle in France than his Socialist predecessors. Mr. Sarkozy is also well aware of the medium-term existential threat to France. As he said recently at a political meeting: 
The Sahel will in 30 years have 200 million inhabitants. There are 6 to 8 children per family on average in the Sahel. Can we continue family reunification in these conditions? Is the future of the Sahel‚Äôs children to end up in our cities‚Äô neighborhoods? Even though we have no jobs, no housing, and we no longer have the means to pay benefits for families who do not pay one cent in taxes. 
Well said! But can Mr. Sarkozy claim to have been unaware of these facts while he was president from 2007 to 2012? The end of family reunification would be welcome, but in the face of the demographic threat to France and all of Europe, this is like fending off a rhinoceros with a water-pistol. Other than this, Mr. Sarkozy has mainly been trying to win the conservative party primaries by complaining about ‚Äúburkinis‚Äù and demanding ‚Äúassimilation.‚Äù However, as a former adviser Patrick Buisson ‚Äìa Rightist who recently published a book on his disenchantment with Mr. Sarkozy‚Äìhas said: ‚ÄúHe is ready to say what is needed to get elected and to then do nothing.‚Äù French police ask a woman to remove some of her clothing to comply with a ban on ‚Äúburkinis.‚Äù 
The gravity of the situation is matched only by the sheer fecklessness of European politicians . According to United Nations statistics, the population of Europe (including a growing proportion of highly-fertile non-Whites) will stagnate and decline this century while that of Africa is set to quadruple to a whopping 4 billion. The most important, tragic, horrifying, ungodly, evil question facing Western Civilization and mankind this century is this: Will Europe turn African ? 
Books warning against Islamization, whether by journalists or second-rate politicians, top the best-seller lists, but most French people care more about welfare and pay checks than long-term considerations. Even on economic issues, they would rather stay in denial, vaguely hoping the problems of a heavily state-run French economy in an inefficient Eurozone monetary union will sort themselves out on their own, rather than ask hard questions. Ethno-religious questions are even more inconceivable. 
It is true that diversity is not yet an unmanageable problem in the daily lives of most Frenchmen, aside from the unpleasant evening news about Muslims shooting up hundreds of people at a rock concert, running down dozens of people with a truck on Bastille Day, or trying to burn policemen to death . Incidentally, the last time France‚Äôs religious homogeneity was broken‚Äìduring the Protestant Reformation‚Äìthis led to a civil war between Catholics and Protestants. 
We are told that mass government surveillance, abrogation of civil liberties, and mass murder by the fanatics of a Middle Eastern religion are the price we pay for enjoying the fruits of diversity. And if you don‚Äôt like it, you will join the scores of European patriots who have been fined and even jailed under anti-free-speech laws for ‚Äúinciting hatred.‚Äù (By the way, France has passed special laws to counter the Islamic terrorism. These same laws have been invoked to spy on thousands of patriots who have been designated as ‚Äúsecurity threats.‚Äù) 
Nonetheless, the current offering for next spring‚Äôs presidential elections in France is dismal. Besides Mr. Hollande and Mr. Sarkozy, with whom the French are thoroughly disenchanted, there is the frontrunner in the conservative primaries, Alain Jupp√©, a felon guilty of misusing public funds, who is proud of France‚Äôs ‚Äúdiversity.‚Äù He speaks of France‚Äôs new ‚Äúhappy identity,‚Äù and is being called a ‚Äústeady,‚Äù ‚Äúserious‚Äù candidate‚Äìwho will change nothing. As mayor of Bordeaux, he noted that 60 percent of the students in some of his schools are ‚Äúforeign-language speakers,‚Äù but appeared to think this was nothing worse than an exciting challenge. 
Then there is the eternal promise of the Front National, a party that has risen to unprecedented heights in polls and secondary elections. But this has come at a significant cost: Marine Le Pen has gone to great lengths to ‚Äúdetoxify‚Äù the party and stay within the bounds acceptable to France‚Äôs heavily policed and state-dependent mainstream media. The ‚Äúnew FN‚Äù talks more about dismantling the European Union and the Euro than about identity and Islam, let alone race. 
Marine Le Pen is breaking no new ground in the fight against political incorrectness, in contrast with the Alternative for Germany‚Äôs Frauke Petry on the other side of the Rhine. And yet, a solid two-thirds of French people still strongly oppose Miss Le Pen. She will probably reach the second-round runoff of the presidential elections and then lose in a landslide, though surely with a better score than her father‚Äôs 18 percent in 2002. The majority of Frenchmen are likely to be repelled by the prospect of an FN government that represents the working classes and the ethnocentric fringe. The conservatives, for their part, have refused to work with the FN ever since the French branch of the B‚Äônai B‚Äôrith asked them to in 1986 . Marine Le Pen 
The most groundbreaking politician in France today is probably the mayor of B√©ziers, Robert M√©nard, who, in a former life as a leftist, founded Reporters Without Borders, but now calls himself a reactionary. He has broken French law by counting the city‚Äôs school children by religion‚Äìhe found that 65 percent were Muslim, judging from their first names. He wants to reinstate the death penalty, opposes homosexual marriage, and he visited a refugee center to tell the occupants they are not welcome in France. Recently he proposed a municipal referendum to reject the imposition of ‚Äúrefugees‚Äù on his town. 
Disenchantment is severe among the French: 83 percent think Mr. Hollande is ‚Äúdisqualified‚Äù as president due to his failure on unemployment. Two-thirds think Mr. Sarkozy and Mr. Hollande were equally bad presidents , and a solid majority, continuously egged on by a hostile media, are ‚Äúworried‚Äù by Marine Le Pen . I am inclined to agree with best-selling author √âric Zemmour , whose latest book is Un Quinquennat Pour Rien (‚ÄúA Five-Year Term for Nothing‚Äù), when he says that the next year‚Äôs elections are pointless. 
Why is there such a divide between the aspirations of French voters and the politicians on offer? I believe this can be explained only by the authoritarian cliquishness of the French political system: The parties and the media serve as critical choke points to prevent the penetration of nationalist and identitarian movements that might appeal to a majority of the French people. No Trump-like figure‚Äìhalf independent billionaire half media personality‚Äìhas emerged to break this stranglehold by uniting the nationalist fringe of the disenfranchised white working class with mainstream conservative voters. 
All this is depressing, but one must not forget that, as the great European historian Dominique Venner said: ‚ÄúHistory is nothing but a set of strategic surprises.‚Äù The presidential elections are in April and May, and six months is a long time in politics. France cannot remain unaffected by the enormous political and cultural gains made in recent years by nationalists across the West. Happy surprises do happen. If Donald Trump were to win, this would set a patriotic and anti-immigration precedent for many Europeans governments. There is a long tradition of opportunistic European politicians slavishly following the American political and cultural lead. 
The mainstream political establishments across Europe are reeling from the economic crisis, the migrant invasion, and‚Äìone must not underestimate this‚Äìthe mainstream media‚Äôs own economic and legitimacy crisis due to the rise of alternative media. These establishments are merely trying, in a dull bovine reflex, to keep the ship on course without ever questioning their premises. But this is proving harder and harder. German Chancellor Angela Merkel, who for her role in opening the floodgates to Afro-Islamic colonization is an objective enemy of Europe, is facing real problems. Her party, the so-called Christian-Democratic Union, has reached its lowest ever levels of support , falling to less than 30 percent. 
The critical media-political choke points of power in the ‚Äúdemocratic‚Äù West‚Äìparticularly in America, Germany, and France‚Äìare more open for takeover than ever. If one or two go, particularly America, many of the rest are likely to follow. If we are lucky, a major shift towards national-populist governments could be possible. This would appeal to the great majority of our people and drastically reduce the pace of dispossession. And that could be a prelude for far greater things to come.",1
Illegal Immigrants Surging to US-Mexico Border in Race Against Election Day,"Illegal Immigrants Surging to US-Mexico Border in Race Against Election Day William La Jeunesse, Fox News, November 3, 2016 
Americans aren‚Äôt the only ones motivated by Tuesday‚Äôs election. The presidential race has immigrants from around the world racing to the U.S.-Mexican border, as the cartels exploit a powerful narrative: get into the U.S. while you still can. 
‚ÄúSmugglers are telling them that they need to come across now while there‚Äôs a chance,‚Äù said Art Del Cueto, a Border Patrol agent in Tucson, Ariz., whose views were echoed by another agent in Texas. 
‚ÄúPeople think if one candidate wins, certain things will happen, like a giant wall being built and then they can never get through,‚Äù said Chris Cabrera, an agent in the Rio Grande Valley. ‚ÄúAnother faction believes that if the other candidate wins, they‚Äôll get amnesty if they‚Äôre here by a certain date.‚Äù 
Those two competing narratives‚Äìtriggered by the rhetoric of Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton, respectively‚Äìare driving immigration numbers the Border Patrol hasn‚Äôt seen in years in some sectors. 
‚ÄúWe are overwhelmed,‚Äù said a veteran agent in McAllen, Texas. ‚ÄúWe are seeing 800 to 1,000 apprehensions every night.‚Äù 
In fiscal 2016, the Border Patrol apprehended 117,200 immigrants from Central America, almost one-third of all apprehensions border-wide‚Äìand 5,000 more than during the so-called surge of 2014. The agency also apprehended 5,000 Haitians, up from just 700 last year. The number of immigrants claiming to be from Africa and Asia also is up. 
{snip} 
The poverty and violence plaguing many of these countries helps push immigrants north, Beeson said. Pull factors include available and good-paying jobs in the U.S. and immigration policy that provides work permits and freedom for immigrants while the courts adjudicate their ‚Äòasylum‚Äô claim. 
‚ÄúWhen you stop somebody, you ask their name and the first thing they tell you is‚Äì‚ÄòI‚Äôm here for asylum, I can‚Äôt go home because they‚Äôll kill me.‚Äô . . . When it takes a good five or six minutes just to get their name out of them, they have a rehearsed story,‚Äù said Cabrera. ‚ÄúOnce they get those papers saying they can pass through our checkpoint, we‚Äôll never see them again.‚Äù 
Del Cueto said the agents are ‚Äúnot getting any backing‚Äù from D.C. and ‚Äúwe need to start enforcing every single immigration law we have on the books.‚Äù 
Del Cueto and Cabrera belong to the National Border Patrol Council, which represents the Border Patrol‚Äôs 18,000 field agents who are prohibited from talking openly to the media.",1
Immigration Surging; 1.5 Million Arriving Each Year,"Immigration Surging; 1.5 Million Arriving Each Year Karen Zeigler and Steven A. CamarotaCenter for Immigration Studies, November 1, 2016 
A Center for Immigration Studies (CIS) analysis of newly released data from the Census Bureau‚Äôs American Community Survey (ACS) shows that 1.5 million new immigrants (legal and illegal) settled in the country in 2014. The number who entered in 2014 represent an increase of 38 percent over the number who were arriving as recently as 2011. The findings confirm a CIS study published in June of this year based on other data showing a surge in legal and illegal immigration in 2014 and 2015. Newly arrived immigrants include new green card holders (permanent residents); long-term ‚Äútemporary‚Äù visitors who often stay permanently, such as guest workers and foreign students; and new illegal immigrants. 
View the entire report here . 
‚ÄúThe data makes clear that the slowdown in immigration that occurred after the Great Recession is over,‚Äù said the Center‚Äôs Director of Research Steven Camarota. He added, ‚Äúmany of these new arrivals are guest workers brought in at the behest of the business community. Whether this is in the best interest of American workers or the country as a whole is a question seldom asked in Washington.‚Äù 
‚Ä¢ Newly released data show 1.5 million new immigrants (legal and illegal) arrived in 2014. Data released for the first six months of 2015 indicates that 1.6 million new immigrants likely arrived in 2015. 
‚Ä¢ The number who arrived in 2014 represents a 17% increase over the number who came in 2013 and a 38 percent increase over the low point in 2011. 
‚Ä¢ Between two-third and three-fourths of the 1.5 million new immigrants settling in the country are legal immigrants, including permanent residents as well as long-term visitors (e.g. guest workers and foreign students). The remainder are new illegal immigrants. 
‚Ä¢ The overall immigrant population grew about twice as fast from 2013 to 2015 as it did in the prior four years, hitting a new record high of 43.3 million. 
‚Ä¢ It is important to note that arrivals are offset by those immigrants who leave the country each year and by normal mortality of about 300,000 annually among the existing immigrant population. Therefore, growth in the overall immigrant population is less than new arrivals. 
‚Ä¢ As a share of the U.S. population, 13.5 percent are now immigrants‚Äìthe highest percentage in 105 years. As recently as 1970, less than 5 percent of the population were immigrants. 
‚Ä¢ Based on current trends and Census Bureau projections, the immigrant share of the population is on track to surpass the highest level in American history seven years from now. 
‚Ä¢ Sending regions with the largest numerical increases in immigrants living in the United States since 2010 were East Asia (up 847,000), South Asia (up 825,000), the Caribbean (up 434,000), Sub-Saharan Africa (up 390,000), the Middle East (up 362,000), and Central America (up 332,000). The number of European immigrants declined by 31,000. 
‚Ä¢ Major sending countries with the largest numerical increases in immigrants living in the United States since 2010 were India (up 609,000), China (up 510,000), the Philippines (up 205,000), the Dominican Republic (up 184,000), El Salvador (up 138,000), Cuba (up 106,000), Nigeria (up 104,000), Guatemala (up 97,000), Haiti (up 88,000), Pakistan (up 80,000), Honduras (up 76,000), Bangladesh (up 75,000), Venezuela (up 71,000), Colombia (up 63,000), Vietnam (up 60,000), and Iraq (up 55,000).

Pew: 8 Million Illegal Immigrant Workers in the U.S. in 2014,"Pew: 8 Million Illegal Immigrant Workers in the U.S. in 2014 Joseph Lawler, Washington Examiner, November 3, 2016 
There were about 8 million illegal immigrants in the U.S. workforce in 2014, a number that didn‚Äôt change significantly since the end of the Great Recession in 2009, according to the Pew Research Center. 
But as a share of the overall labor force, illegal immigrants have declined slightly from 2009 to 2014, from 5.2 percent to 5 percent. 
Thursday‚Äôs report, written by researchers Jeffrey Passel and D‚ÄôVera Cohn and based on U.S. Census figures, indicates that the country‚Äôs reliance on unauthorized labor hasn‚Äôt changed much since the 2008 financial crisis, which drastically slowed or even reversed migration from Mexico. The report examines the illegal immigrant workforce up through 2014. 
Before the crisis, especially as the housing bubble inflated, the share of unauthorized labor soared, from below 3 percent of the labor force in the 1990s to 5.4 percent just prior to the crash.

About 10 percent of the illegal immigrant workforce has been protected from deportation, according to Pew, by executive orders from President Obama . Hillary Clinton has said that she will expand on those orders. {snip}

LAPD Investigating Boyle Heights Vandalism as Possible Hate Crimes Sparked by Gentrification Fight,"LAPD Investigating Boyle Heights Vandalism as Possible Hate Crimes Sparked by Gentrification Fight Brittny Mejia, Los Angeles Times, November 3, 2016 
The Los Angeles Police Department is treating three acts of vandalism in the last month targeting art galleries in Boyle Heights, including graffiti at one gallery that attacked ‚Äúwhite art,‚Äù as possible hate crimes. 
The probe comes amid a debate in the predominantly Latino Eastside neighborhood over the growing art scene there and whether it‚Äôs part of a gentrification that some activists fear will push working-class families out. Galleries have been popping up in the area over the last few years as some artists get priced out of downtown‚Äôs Arts District and other areas. 
‚ÄúWe don‚Äôt know who actually did [the vandalism], but because it actually made a reference to anti-white art or anti-white, it‚Äôs basically saying that it‚Äôs a hate crime based on that,‚Äù Det. John Parra of the LAPD‚Äôs Hollenbeck station said of a vulgar curse against ‚Äúwhite art‚Äù that in one of the incidents was spray-painted on the Nicodim Gallery. 
Boyle Heights has become a flashpoint as Los Angeles undergoes a wave of gentrification fueled by rising home prices and a renewed interest in urban neighborhoods by many. It‚Äôs already transformed once-working-class communities such as Echo Park and Highland Park. But some in Boyle Heights‚Äìfor decades the heart of L.A.‚Äôs Mexican American community‚Äìhave vowed to fight the change. 
In the last three years, more than a dozen galleries have appeared in the area , many in an industrial zone just west of the 101 Freeway. Community activists fear the galleries will inflate property values and push poorer residents out. 
In September, activists marched through Boyle Heights and posted mock eviction notices for ‚Äúgentrifiers,‚Äù which included a couple of galleries. 
{snip} 
But the three incidents prompted the Hollenbeck Division to call a meeting with gallery owners last week to try to get an understanding of the problem and come up with a plan, including attempting to open a dialogue with the activist group Defend Boyle Heights, which has been a driving force of opposition to the galleries. 
{snip} 
On Thursday afternoon, Defend Boyle Heights issued a statement saying it was not responsible for vandalizing the galleries. 
‚ÄúWe don‚Äôt know who tagged up these galleries, but we . . . certainly don‚Äôt condemn it. It is right to rebel! We are glad to see the community rise up to resist displacement, art washing and gentrification‚Äìhowever they see fit! Your anger is justified,‚Äù the statement read. 
‚ÄúGentrification is the true, highest form of hate crime!‚Äù 
Activists have demanded that the art galleries leave the neighborhood and allow the community to decide what will take their place.

Soros Spends $2 Million to Defeat Arpaio,"Soros Spends $2 Million to Defeat Arpaio Scott Bland, Politico, November 4, 2016 
George Soros has contributed $2 million to a group working to defeat Maricopa County Sheriff Joe Arpaio in Arizona, the latest target of Soros‚Äô big spending in local law enforcement campaigns over the past year. 
The Soros-funded PAC, Maricopa Strong, will file campaign finance documents Friday showing Soros‚Äô multi-million dollar investment against Arpaio, along with $500,000 from Texas energy billionaires Laura and John Arnold and $250,000 from Laurene Powell Jobs (the widow of Apple co-founder Steve Jobs). The group had previously reported a $300,000 donation from Soros, one of the Democratic Party‚Äôs biggest donors. 
Soros has spent millions in 2015 and 2016 funding campaigns to defeat local prosecutors around the country and elect new ones who back criminal justice reform measures. Soros-backed groups are currently spending big in three big-city district attorney races: Houston‚Äôs Harris County, where Soros has contributed over $1 million, according to local campaign finance filings; Gilpin and Jefferson counties outside Denver, where Soros has given about $1.5 million to unseat an incumbent; and Phoenix‚Äôs Maricopa County, where a Soros-funded PAC has also spent over $1 million against the Republican district attorney, Bill Montgomery. 
But Soros‚Äô spending against Arpaio, a high-profile liberal bogeyman, is his single biggest investment in a local race this year, as well as the billionaire‚Äôs first effort against a sheriff. It folds in immigration reform, another policy passion of Soros‚Äô, alongside criminal justice reform. 
{snip} 
Maricopa Strong has spent $2.9 million in the sheriff‚Äôs race, with the donations from Soros and others funding a flurry of mailers and TV ads boosting Democratic candidate Paul Penzone and hammering Arpaio. Soros has typically been the sole funder of his local outside-spending campaigns around the country, though Jobs and the Arnolds joined him in funding Maricopa Strong. 
{snip} 
Arpaio‚Äôs campaign has attacked Soros‚Äô efforts, calling him a ‚Äúfar-left globalist,‚Äù saying he is trying to buy a local race, and alleging that his group has broken disclosure rules, per the Arizona Republic. 
{snip} 
Arpaio has aired about $2.8 million of his own TV ads, according to a media-tracking source, and has leaned on his national name recognition to raise millions more for his campaign, while Penzone‚Äôs campaign has been less well-funded. But several polls this fall have shown Penzone leading Arpaio in his second attempt to unseat the sheriff.

"Studies Examine Racial Bias in Pollution, Devaluation of Black Communities","Studies Examine Racial Bias in Pollution, Devaluation of Black Communities Brian Flood, UIC, November 3, 2016 
Present-day racial biases may contribute to the pollution and devaluation of lower- and middle-class black communities, according to new research led by a social psychologist at the University of Illinois at Chicago. 
The investigation was based on several studies demonstrating that physical spaces, such as houses or neighborhoods, are targets of racial stereotyping, discrimination, and implicit racial bias. 
The researchers found study participants applied negative stereotypes, such as ‚Äúimpoverished,‚Äù ‚Äúcrime-ridden,‚Äù or ‚Äúdirty,‚Äù in their perceptions of physical spaces associated with black Americans. 
‚ÄúThese space-focused stereotypes can make people feel less connected to a space, assume it has low-quality characteristics, monetarily devalue it, and dampen its protection from environmental harms,‚Äù said Courtney Bonam, UIC assistant professor of psychology and the study‚Äôs lead author. 
‚ÄúSome of the findings show that space-focused stereotypes figuratively pollute the way observers imagine a target area and their judgment about an existing structure in it, while other work demonstrates how this presumed figurative pollution leads observers to consider literally polluting black space.‚Äù 
{snip} 
One study asked a national sample of over 400 white U.S. citizens to read a proposal to build a potentially hazardous chemical plant near a residential neighborhood. Half of the participants were told the nearby neighborhood is mostly black, while the other half was told that the area is mostly white. 
Even though all participants read the same proposal, they were less likely to report opposition to building the chemical plant when the nearby neighborhood was mostly black. 
‚ÄúThey assumed it was an industrial area when it was black, which led them to devalue and subsequently pollute the land there,‚Äù Bonam said. ‚ÄúAdditionally, these findings held when participants were told that the neighborhood had middle-class property values; and when accounting both for participants‚Äô perceptions of the neighborhood‚Äôs class level, and their negative attitudes toward black people in general.‚Äù 
In another study, a national sample of more than 200 white U.S. citizens were given pictures of the same middle-class, suburban house. Half of the people were told the house was in a predominately black neighborhood, while the other segment was informed that it was in a mostly white neighborhood. 
Those who thought the house was in a black neighborhood estimated its value at $20,000 less than the other group, and were less likely to say they would live in or buy the house.

Rutgers Student Fired from Campus Newspaper After Writing ‚ÄòIllegal Alien‚Äô in Column,"Toni Airaksinen, College Fix, November 4, 2016 
{snip} 
The Rutgers University student who hosted anti-feminist provocateur Milo Yiannopoulos for his first U.S. college event says the student newspaper fired him Monday because of his conservative views. 
Aviv Khavich published his final column for The Daily Targum Sunday night, arguing that immigration enforcement is not ‚Äúanti-immigrant.‚Äù 
He spoke as an immigrant himself, born in Israel after his Ashkenazi Jewish parents fled Belarus in the wake of the Soviet Union‚Äôs collapse. 
But the trigger for the firing may have been Khavich‚Äôs demand that his column include the phrase ‚Äúillegal aliens‚Äù to describe those in the country illegally. 
It was the final straw for the Daily‚Äôs editor, who said Khavich repeatedly fought over ‚Äústylistic‚Äù editing changes to his columns over the past several months. 
{snip} 
But two of his last three [columns] were about immigration. Khavich opposes accepting Syrian refugees into America as a security threat, and his final column Sunday said flatly: ‚ÄúJustice is mass deportation. Justice is respecting my [legal immigrant] family and millions of others like us.‚Äù 
Khavich told The College Fix in a phone interview that ‚Äúevery instance of ‚Äòillegal alien‚Äô I wrote was changed to ‚Äòundocumented immigrant‚Äô‚Äù by his editors. ‚ÄúBut I considered it a part of my opinion to not use‚Äù the latter term, which he finds ‚Äúpolitically correct and also inaccurate.‚Äù 
When Khavich complained to his editor about the edited draft, she said the ‚Äúillegal‚Äù edit came from the top: Editor in Chief Dan Corey wanted the column to follow Associated Press Style. 
The AP Stylebook was revised three years ago to disapprove of using ‚Äúillegal‚Äù to describe a person, as opposed to an action, after having affirmed ‚Äúillegal immigrant‚Äù just a year earlier . 
But AP Style also frowns upon ‚Äúundocumented‚Äù‚Äìthe term used in Khavich‚Äôs published column‚Äìbecause the term is ‚Äúnot precise.‚Äù Khavich notes that federal law uses the term ‚Äúalien.‚Äù 
His editor was ‚Äúnot happy‚Äù after being confronted, Khavich said, and he was fired the next day. 
{snip} 
‚ÄúAt the slightest questioning of their ‚Äòunbiased editing,‚Äô they jump at the excuse to rid themselves of someone who has been challenging their narrative,‚Äù he wrote in The Tab. 
‚ÄúI was writing articles that very strongly challenged narratives,‚Äù he told The Fix. ‚ÄúI am sure that it was a termination was based on political bias.‚Äù",1
Obsessing over Europe‚Äôs Refugee Crisis While Ignoring Africa‚Äôs Is White Privilege at Work,"Obsessing over Europe‚Äôs Refugee Crisis While Ignoring Africa‚Äôs Is White Privilege at Work Mehdi Hasan, Washington Post, November 3, 2016 
Have you not heard? Europe is in the throes of a refugee crisis. Hosting asylum-seekers from Syria is a ‚Äúhistoric test of Europe,‚Äù says Germany‚Äôs Angela Merkel. ‚ÄúThe most responsibility [for refugees] is and will continue to be placed on Europe,‚Äù adds European Council President Donald Tusk. 
For President Obama, ‚Äúuncontrolled migration into Europe‚Äù is a ‚Äúmajor national security issue‚Äù for the United States. Even the Dalai Lama agrees that there are ‚Äútoo many‚Äù refugees inside the European Union. 
Really? ‚ÄúToo many‚Äù? ‚ÄúHistoric‚Äù? Consider these facts: More than 65 million people were forced from their homes by conflict or persecution in 2015, according to the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) , including 21.3 million people classified as refugees living outside the borders of their own countries. 
Admittedly, a record 1.3 million refugees sought asylum within the European Union last year, with thousands more applying for asylum every month. Yet what of Sub-Saharan Africa, home to 4.4 million refugees and a whopping 19.5 million ‚Äúpeople of concern‚Äù to the UN High Commissioner for Refugees? 
We don‚Äôt often hear about these particular refugees or asylum-seekers, do we? They are, to borrow a term from British historian Mark Curtis, ‚Äúunpeople,‚Äù the poor, nonwhite residents of the developing world who tend to be ignored by the Western media. 
Where is the rolling coverage of Kenya‚Äôs Dadaab camp, for example? Dadaab is the largest refugee camp in the world, but in a move that could displace as many as 300,000 people , Kenyan authorities are in the process of closing it down. It puts the recent British media frenzy over the so-called ‚ÄúJungle‚Äù camp in Calais, France, with its 10,000 migrants, into some perspective, doesn‚Äôt it?

Yet Europe‚Äôs refugee crisis continues to suck up all the oxygen of global publicity. The UNHCR fundraises for a whole host of ‚Äúspecial situations‚Äù involving refugees. As of the end of October, the ‚Äú Central African Republic situation ‚Äù was 17 percent funded; the ‚Äú Somalia situation ‚Äù 21 percent funded and the ‚Äú South Sudan situation ‚Äù 25 percent funded. The ‚Äú crisis in Europe ,‚Äù however? Fifty-six percent funded. 
The double standard is as brazen as it is shameful. Remember: The European Union accounts for 17 percent of global GDP ; Sub-Saharan Africa accounts for a little more than 3 percent .

This is not just navel-gazing hyperbole but white privilege, plain and simple. How else to describe a collective tendency to obsess over a refugee crisis in (rich, white) Europe, rather than in (poor, black) Africa? In what warped world are thousands of penniless and homeless refugees considered to constitute a crisis only when they wash up on the shores of western Europe?",1
Harvard Cancels Men‚Äôs Soccer Season After Finding Sexually Explicit ‚ÄòReports‚Äô Continued Through 2016,"Harvard Cancels Men‚Äôs Soccer Season After Finding Sexually Explicit ‚ÄòReports‚Äô Continued Through 2016 Andrew M. Duehren et al., Harvard Crimson, November 3, 2016 
Harvard has cancelled the men‚Äôs soccer team‚Äôs season after an Office of General Counsel review found that the team continued to produce vulgar and explicit documents rating women on their perceived sexual appeal and physical appearance. 
Athletics Director Robert L. Scalise wrote in an email to Harvard student athletes that he decided to cancel the rest of the team‚Äôs season because the ‚Äúpractice appears to be more widespread across the team and has continued beyond 2012, including in 2016.‚Äù 
‚ÄúAs a direct result of what Harvard Athletics has learned, we have decided to cancel the remainder of the 2016 men‚Äôs soccer season,‚Äù Scalise wrote. ‚ÄúThe team will forfeit its remaining games and will decline any opportunity to achieve an Ivy League championship or to participate in the NCAA Tournament this year.‚Äù 
Last week, The Crimson reported that the 2012 men‚Äôs soccer team created a ‚Äúscouting report‚Äù of that year‚Äôs women‚Äôs soccer recruits, rating them numerically and assigning each a hypothetical sexual position. University President Drew G. Faust instructed OGC, Harvard‚Äôs team of lawyers, to ‚Äúreview‚Äù the matter.

‚ÄúThe decision to cancel a season is serious and consequential, and reflects Harvard‚Äôs view that both the team‚Äôs behavior and the failure to be forthcoming when initially questioned are completely unacceptable, have no place at Harvard, and run counter to the mutual respect that is a core value of our community,‚Äù Faust wrote in a statement. 
Faust wrote she ‚Äúwas deeply distressed to learn that the appalling actions of the 2012 men‚Äôs soccer team were not isolated to one year or the actions of a few individuals.‚Äù

Putin Condemns Europe‚Äôs Handling of Migrants and Says the Child Rape in Austria Shows ‚Äòa Dilution of National Values‚Äô,"Loading Posted on November 4, 2016 Putin Condemns Europe‚Äôs Handling of Migrants and Says the Child Rape in Austria Shows ‚Äòa Dilution of National Values‚Äô Jennifer Newton, Daily Mail, November 3, 2016 
Vladimir Putin has waded into the migrant crisis condemning Europe‚Äôs handling of asylum seekers and saying a case of child rape in Austria ‚Äòdilutes national values‚Äô. 
The Russian president has largely kept quiet over the refugee crisis in Europe but has now spoken out of his disbelief over its handling claiming that a continent that ‚Äòcan‚Äôt protect its children‚Äô has no future. 
His comments come off the back of a case in Austria last week, which saw an Iraqi migrant have his conviction of raping a 10-year-old boy at a swimming pool in Vienna overturned. 
He was originally convicted of the crime but it was overturned because a court didn‚Äôt prove he realised the boy was saying no. 
It came after the migrant, identified as 20-year-old Amir A., claimed that it was a ‚Äòsexual emergency‚Äô because he had not had sex for four months. 
A second trial for the rape is expected to take place next year, but the attacker is likely to remain in custody until then. 
And speaking at a press conference this week, Putin slammed Europe‚Äôs migration policy and cited the case, where the victim was from a Serbian family living in Austria. 
He said: ‚ÄòIn a European country, a child is raped by a migrant, and the court releases him. 
‚ÄòIt doesn‚Äôt fit into my head what on earth they‚Äôre thinking over there. 
‚ÄòI can‚Äôt even explain the rationale‚Äìis it a sense of guilt before the migrants? What‚Äôs going on? It‚Äôs not clear.‚Äô 
He also claimed that the case highlighted ‚Äòthe dissolution of traditional national values‚Äô adding: ‚ÄòA society that cannot defend its children has no future.‚Äô 
And Putin‚Äôs words appeared to have struck a chord, as he is extremely popular with Serbs. 
In the rape case, the boy had arrived in Austria with his Serbian mother, who paid for him to go to the Theresienbad swimming pool, where he was violently attacked. 
The boy was so badly injured that he needed hospital treatment but he will be forced to go back to court for the Iraqi man‚Äôs second trial, outraging the Austrian Serbian community. 
Austrian media say the case has hardened the communities position against asylum seekers, who were previously divided about whether to vote for the left-leaning Green party candidate or the far right option Nobert Hofer in upcoming elections. 
However, it is not the first time Russia has lashed out at the EU‚Äôs handling of the migrant crisis. 
In March, Konstantin Romodanovsky, head of Russia‚Äôs Federal Migration Service accused leaders of willfully ignoring cultural differences that have caused such widespread friction and chaos across the Continent. 
He also added that ‚Äòmulticulturalism has failed‚Äô because Europe never formed a unified strategy to integrate refugees into Western society. 
He said: ‚ÄòThe European Commission left it up to individual nations to decide how they want to treat asylum seekers‚Äìdespite the fact the policies and capabilities of member states are very different. 
Romodanovsky also accused EU countries of ignoring the ‚Äòdifferences in culture, religious traditions, and customs‚Äô with the refugees, the vast majority of whom are Islamic.",1
When the River Ran Red,"When the River Ran Red Arthur Kemp, American Renaissance, September 2008 
The year is 1838. Dodging a flurry of spears, the Boer commander, Andries Pretorius, rides forward to seize a Zulu warrior. In the midst of an epic battle between more than 15,000 warriors and just 468 Boers, Pretorius has decided to take a Zulu alive. He wants to send the captive back to his king, Dingaan, to convey surrender terms to the Zulu nation. 
The warrior has no intention of being taken alive, and jabs viciously at Pretorius with his assegai. This is a Zulu spear, normally a long-shafted throwing weapon, but the warrior broke its shank earlier for close-quarter stabbing. Pretorius gives up on capturing the Zulu, and tries to shoot him. 
With a single-shot, muzzle-loading musket, he has only one chance of a hit. There is no time to reload in close combat. To his horror, Pretorius sees the smoke-trailing ball whiz past the Zulu‚Äôs ear. At the same time, the Zulu lunges forward, causing Pretorius‚Äôs horse to stumble backwards, throwing the white commander to the ground. 
Leaping to his feet, he meets the attacking Zulu, who knows he is now on equal terms with the white man, who can no longer use his magic shooting stick and carries no weapon comparable to the assegai. Pretorius is now fighting for his life. He just manages to sidestep the spear point, striking it away with the butt of his gun. 
Spinning round, the Zulu raises his spear high above his head and thrusts down, as he has been trained to do in the Zulus‚Äô disciplined army. It is a blow that will be fatal if it strikes home, but Pretorius sees it coming. He grabs the spear point with his left hand to ward it away from his chest. The sharp point cuts deeply into his palm, embedding itself at an angle that makes it impossible for the Zulu to pull it out. Pretorius seizes the Zulu by the throat with his free right hand and throws him to the ground in an attempt to strangle him. 
The Zulu struggles, and with the help of two good hands is about to break free, when one of Pretorius‚Äôs men comes upon the scene. He pulls the assegai out of the commander‚Äôs hand, and plunges it into the Zulu‚Äôs side, ending the struggle. 
Pretorius remounts and heads back to the Boer camp for treatment. He is not worried, as he knows by now that this greatest of all battles between Boers and Zulus has already been won. The main Zulu army has been broken in two, and the river that runs along one side of the Boer camp is stained red with Zulu blood. The place and the tributary known previously as the Ncome will be renamed Blood River. Pretorius knows that the Zulu defeat, which will include some 3,000 killed on the battlefield, is a fit revenge for the deception and murder committed by the Zulus 10 months earlier. 
Prelude to War 
The great clash between the Boer and Zulu nations was not, as leftist historians like to claim, the result of ruthless white colonialism suppressing an indigenous people. It came about because the Zulus rejected an extremely reasonable attempt at negotiation by the Boers. 
The Boers, pioneers of Dutch, French, and German descent, were the people who opened up much of what was later to become South Africa. Their first antecedents had landed on the southernmost tip of Africa in 1652, only 45 years after the Virginia Company settled on Jamestown Island. 
When they arrived in the area now known as Cape Town, whites came into contact only with Hottentots and Bushmen. As the number of Europeans increased, they expanded east and north, only meeting their first black tribe, the Xhosa, some 500 miles away, on South Africa‚Äôs east coast. The Xhosas were migrating south, fleeing the warlike Zulu to the north, who were engaged in imperialist expansion of their own. 
For just under a century white settlement halted at this eastern frontier border formed by the coast and firm Xhosa settlement. It was not, however, a time of peace, as Xhosa were constantly raiding the Boers who lived on the border. This caused much harm and discontent among the farmers, who blamed the Dutch-ruled colonial government back in Cape Town for the lawlessness. 
It only added to the border farmers‚Äô grievances when the British took the Cape Colony from the Dutch in 1806 to prevent the colony from falling into French hands during the Napoleonic Wars. It was vital to control the merchant and naval refitting station on the way to the Far East. The new colonial masters not only started anglicizing the colony, when they abolished slavery they offered compensation that amounted to hardly a quarter of a slave‚Äôs value. 
Exasperated by incessant Xhosa attacks and British attempts to suppress their language and culture, groups of frontier farmers, filled with a sense of manifest destiny not seen again until the opening of the American West, set forth to the north and the east in a movement known as the Great Trek. The trekkers (they became known as Voortrekkers, or pioneers, only after 1880) bypassed the Xhosa in search of new, unsettled territory, in which they could establish independent Boer nations. All told, it was only a small minority of no more than 12,000 Boers who made the trek to the future Natal, Orange Free State, and Transvaal regions. They traveled in several waves of covered, ox-drawn wagons much like the Conestogas in which Americans opened the West. 
The Boer leader of the time, Piet Retief, had written the trekker ‚Äúmanifesto,‚Äù in which he spelled out the farmers‚Äô long-held grievances against the British. By1836, the Boer wagons had crossed the great mountain range into Natal, in an act of audacity that few thought possible. The range, the highest in southern Africa, had been named the Drakensberg‚Äîthe Dragon Mountains‚Äîbecause they were said to be impassable. 
Retief had identified a large piece of uninhabited land to the north of the Zulu kingdom, which lay open to settlement. Retief knew that if he wanted the land for his people, he could take it unopposed. However, he wanted to live in peace with his Zulu neighbors, and before taking possession, he opened negotiations with the Zulu king, Dingaan. He wanted no misunderstanding between the two peoples. 
He sent a letter to the Zulu king explaining why he wanted to speak to him, and first visited Dingaan‚Äôs capital‚Äîa large circle of reed and grass huts‚Äîon November 5, 1837. Retief left the main body of trekkers and went to the Zulu king‚Äôs capital, Umgungundhlovo (‚Äúthe place of the elephant‚Äù), to negotiate a treaty that would allow Boers peacefully to settle land adjoining the Zulu kingdom. Dingaan said he would let the Boers live in Natal if they recovered cattle stolen by a Tlokwa chieftain. Retief and his men did so, and Dingaan agreed to give the land to the Boers. 
Retief returned to Umgungundhlovo on February 3, 1838, to finalize the agreement. He arrived with 60 volunteers, including his own son and three children of other men‚Äîit was common for children to accompany their fathers on expeditions of this kind. The next day, Retief and Dingaan formally signed a treaty‚Äîthe Zulu king made his mark by scratching an ‚ÄúX‚Äù on the document‚Äîgiving possession of the land to the Boers. Delighted, the Boers sent scouts back to the main encampments to report the successful outcome and made ready to leave. As Retief and his party were about to saddle up, a messenger arrived from Dingaan inviting the Boer party to a special celebration to mark the signing. Retief was suspicious but did not want to offend Dingaan. As they had on previous visits, the Boers stacked their firearms neatly outside the reed walls and entered the royal enclosure unarmed. 
As they ate and drank, a Zulu impi, or warrior unit, put on a dance for the guests. According to the account of a white missionary who was present, the dancing warriors drew ever closer to the Boers, till they were just in front of the seated whites. When the Zulu king leaped to his feet and shouted, ‚ÄúKill the white wizards!‚Äù the impi fell upon the surprised Boers. Some of them drew their hunting knives and tried to fight off the attackers, but they were quickly overwhelmed. 
The Zulu warriors bound the whites with reed ropes and dragged them to Hlomo Amabutho, the Hill of Execution, near the Zulu capital. There they clubbed the Boers to death, one by one, with Retief kept until last and forced to watch his son being murdered. After Retief‚Äôs heart was extracted and presented to Dingaan as proof that the Boer leader was dead, the bodies were left for the vultures, in accordance with Zulu custom. 
Dingaan then gave orders for the full might of his army to attack the Boer camps. The settlers had received the message Retief had sent earlier and believed everything had gone well. They were therefore completely unprepared and badly undermanned. The 60 men in Retief‚Äôs party were all dead. Many other men had gone hunting, leaving only a light guard for the women and children. The Boers were so confident there would be peace that they had not even posted sentries. Just before dawn, barking dogs aroused the outlying wagons. Then, thousands of Zulu warriors attacked the several hundred trekkers ‚Äî women, children, and old men ‚Äî as they lay sleeping. 
The Boer historian, Gustav Preller, who interviewed survivors, left a harrowing account of the aftermath: ‚ÄúAll around dozens and dozens of bodies ‚Ä¶ babies who had had their heads smashed open against the wagon wheels, women, dishonored and in some Zulu custom, their breasts cut off ‚Ä¶ [I]n a wagon, blood filled to a height of several inches, the life blood of an entire family ebbed out where they lay ‚Ä¶ Jan Bezuidenhout, one of the few young men who had not gone ahead with the Retief party, grabbed his four-month-old baby daughter out of her crib and ran off through the undergrowth ‚Ä¶ [H]aving lost his pursuers a few miles away, Bezuidenhout checked for the first time on his daughter in his arms. She was dead; a single spear stroke had killed her.‚Äù 
The slaughter became known as the Weenen, the Dutch word for weeping, and a town of that name still stands near the site. Of the 600 Boers camped in the area, Zulus killed some 300, including 185 children. The rest survived because grazing requirements for their animals meant that the Boer camps had to be widely dispersed. If Dingaan‚Äôs men had scouted more thoroughly, found all the encampments, and attacked them simultaneously, the slaughter would have been far greater. 
Pretorius arrives 
The Boers now faced their greatest challenge. Their camps were full of wounded men, orphaned children, and widows. The Zulus had stolen an estimated 25,000 head of cattle and sheep during the Weenen slaughter, and ammunition was running low. The Zulu armies might return at any time, and they were a formidable force, as the Boers discovered when they launched a raid to avenge the massacre. On April 6, 1838, 347 trekkers under a divided command of Piet Uys and Hendrik Potgieter rode into Zulu territory only to be defeated by some 7,000 warriors not far from Umgungundhlovo in what became known as the Battle of Italeni. 
This new disaster forced the Boers to face reality: They had to either abandon their quest for independence and return to the Cape Colony, or find some means to fight their way through. The widows and orphans argued strongly for pushing on. They knew that if they fell back to the Cape they would have to live on charity, whereas if Dingaan could be defeated they could at least recover their livestock. Many Boers were also convinced that God favored them, and that setbacks were only a test of faith. 
It was at this moment of indecision that a popular lawyer named Andries Pretorius answered the trekker call for reinforcements, and rode into camp with 60 men and a brass cannon. The Boers appointed him commander in chief on November 25, and he immediately began preparing a strike against the Zulu. 
His means were few. A force of only about 468 Boers, including three Scotsmen, set out on November 27 seeking battle. For extra protection, the Boer column of 64 wagons traveled four abreast, instead of the usual single file. Each night, they formed a circular defensive formation, known as a laager. 
Pretorius realized that even with two front-loading cannon, his force was too weak to defeat the Zulu army in an open field. He therefore decided to draw the enemy into an attack on the Boer encampment. Each day patrols and scouting parties rode ahead, sometimes led by Pretorius himself, to make sure no unexpected surprises were waiting over the horizon. 
On December 9, 1838, the Boer party reached the Zandspruit tributary of the Waschbank River. It was here that the Boer chaplain, Sarel Cilliers, first pledged during his nightly sermon that if God helped them defeat the Zulus, they and their descendents would celebrate that day in honor of God, and that they would build a church in commemoration. The Boers repeated this oath, known in Afrikaner folklore as ‚Äúthe covenant,‚Äù every night until they met the enemy. 
There appeared to be no movement from the Zulu side. On December 12, Pretorius decided to move camp to the Buffalo River, hoping to provoke the Zulus by moving farther into their territory. That day, he sent out two patrols, one under the command of his deputy, Commandant Hans De Lange, and another, under the Scotsman Edward Parker. This latter group saw action when they came upon a small group of Zulus. They killed the warriors and took the women prisoner. 
Pretorius drew up a message for Dingaan on a white cloth, explaining that he was leading a commando to punish the Zulus. If, however, Dingaan was willing to cooperate, Pretorius wrote, he was still willing to make peace‚Äîa generous offer in light of the earlier betrayal. He freed the prisoners and told them to give the message to Dingaan. He received no answer. 
On December 13, the Boers spotted Zulus and what appeared to be a large number of cattle near their camp. Piet Uys had been tricked by such a ploy at the Battle of Italeni. Zulu warriors, crouching behind toughened animal-skin shields, looked like cattle from a distance, and Uys dropped his guard. He was killed in a surprise attack by the ‚Äúcattle.‚Äù 
Pretorius did not make the same mistake, and he sent a 120-strong mounted unit to investigate the ‚Äúcattle.‚Äù They turned out to be Zulus, and in the short fight that followed the Boers killed eight warriors but suffered no casualties. Pretorius now suspected that the Zulus were preparing for battle. 
On December 15 he moved the Boer camp to a position alongside the Ncome River, itself a tributary of the Buffalo River. A scouting expedition that day confirmed the presence of two huge Zulu armies a short distance away. 
Pretorius prepared for battle. His men drew the wagons into a D-shaped formation, one side overlooking a large hippopotamus path facing the Ncome River, another side facing a soil erosion ditch, and the third side facing the open plain. Pretorius chose the site to limit the directions from which the Zulus could attack. 
The laager was large enough to contain all the horses and oxen. The defenders tied the wagons together with leather ropes, and closed off all openings between and below the wagons with a Pretorius innovation, so-called fighting gates, which were slatted wood fixtures through which defenders could fire. They left two small openings, sealed with removable fighting gates, so cavalry could leave the laager. Finally, they attached lanterns to the ends of large ox-whips planted upright in the ground. These dangled in front of the laager and were to serve as forward lighting during the dark hours when Zulu usually attacked. Zulus captured after the battle said they had believed the lights waving in the breeze above the Boer camp were spirits, and that fear of the spirits kept them from attacking that night. 
Battle is joined 
In Pretorius‚Äôs own account of the battle, he wrote that as the mist cleared on the morning of December 16, he saw that the Boer camp was completely encircled by tens of thousands of Zulu warriors, even where the terrain would have made an attack difficult. Estimates placed the number of Zulus at between 15,000 and 25,000, although no official count was possible. Whatever the figure, Pretorius wrote that it was a ‚Äúterrible sight.‚Äù 
The Boers had been ready and armed since two hours before daybreak. The two cannon were in position, and the fighting gates closed. The defenders expected to run out of ammunition for the cannon, and had stacked up suitably sized stones at strategic points along the perimeter to fire as a last resort. The Boers would fire stones that day. 
The front lines of the Zulu force were still, squatting, only about 40 paces from the wagons, waiting for the signal to attack. Pretorius decided to strike first. At his signal, three bursts of fire from the Boer guns and two blasts from the cannon broke the silence. The Boers‚Äô orders were to then hold their fire. As the billows of gunpowder smoke lifted, they saw that the surviving Zulus had fled some 500 paces from their former front line, leaving behind dozens of dying and dead comrades. 
The Boers then heard the noise of the Zulus breaking their spear shafts to make them into short, stabbing weapons. A frontal assault was coming. A few minutes later, the Zulu force stormed the wagons, screaming wildly, shields held high, and assegais in readiness. Withering gunfire ripped through the Zulu ranks, and while some managed to reach the wagons, they were gunned down before they could cut through the wagon canvasses. 
Another group of Zulus tried to attack from inside the erosion ditch by standing on each others‚Äô shoulders and scrambling over the edge. Pretorius ordered Cilliers, the fighting churchman, to see off the attack. He led a group of men out of the relative safety of the wagon perimeter, and they proceeded to kill some 400 Zulus. One Boer, Philip Fourie, was wounded when an assegai struck him in the side. 
The Boers then wheeled one of their cannon out of the laager, pointed it into the ditch, and fired a shot that literally blew apart the assaulting party. The survivors fled the ditch in disarray. This sparked a temporary retreat by the Zulu, and marked the end of the second unsuccessful attempt to break the Boer lines. The wounded Boer, Fourie, returned to the wagon circle for treatment. 
As the Zulus waited for new orders, Pretorius ordered another burst of cannon fire into their ranks, provoking a spontaneous charge against the wagons. Although it was the longest single assault of the nine-hour battle, it was utterly defeated, as the Boers cut down wave after wave of attackers. Gun barrels got so hot men had to hold them with wet cloths for reloading. 
As the third attack fell back, the Boers launched their first surprise counterattack, as the mobile fighting gates swung open and a cavalry unit charged the Zulu lines. Shooting from the saddle, the Boers tried to turn the Zulu lines to their left. Desperate Zulu resistance, which saw hundreds more of their number killed, stopped the encircling action, and the Boer horsemen rode back to the wagons. They regrouped and launched a second attempt, driving the Zulus further away. A third mounted charge finally broke through the Zulu lines. The Boer cavalry then turned and attacked the Zulus from the rear. Pinned between the cavalry and cannon fire from within the wagon circle, the main Zulu force facing the open plain scattered. 
A reserve Zulu force tried to cross the Ncome River to attack the laager but so many warriors were gunned down that their blood stained the water red. Pretorius himself then led another cavalry charge from within the laager. Cut to pieces, with thousands dead, the Zulu army, which had courageously charged repeatedly against a better-armed enemy, finally broke ranks and fled. 
Pretorius divided his cavalry into two units and sent them in pursuit. Mounted Boers killed hundreds of warriors during a three-hour chase. It was during this pursuit that Pretorius was wounded. Two other Boers, including Fourie, suffered nonfatal assegai wounds, but these were the only Boer casualties. An estimated 3,000 Zulus died on the battlefield, and many more died later from wounds. 
The Aftermath 
Early the next morning, Pretorius ordered the camp broken, and marched the commando straight to the Zulu king‚Äôs capital. He was confident the Zulus no longer posed any significant threat, but he hardly expected the sight that awaited him on December 20 at Umgungundhlovo. Dingaan had fled with his wives and cattle, leaving the circular camp of reed huts burning, as a symbol of the destruction of Zulu power. 
On the outskirts of the capital the Boers found the skeletons of Retief and his men. ‚ÄúTheir hands and feet were still bound fast with thongs of ox hide,‚Äù wrote Cilliers, ‚Äúand in nearly all the corpses a spike as thick as an arm had been forced into the anus so that the point of the spike was in the chest.‚Äù Retief, who was identified by the remains of a satin vest he had worn, still had a leather bag draped over his shoulder bone. In it was the treaty, signed by Dingaan, giving the Boers the unoccupied land to the north. According to one of the Boers who saw it, the treaty was astonishingly well preserved‚Äîas if it had been ‚Äúleft in a closed box.‚Äù Pretorius‚Äôs men buried Retief and his party on Christmas Day 1838. 
Dingaan fled north but was captured by a rival tribe, the Swazis. Earlier, he had persecuted the Swazis, and they murdered him in revenge. The new Zulu king, Mpande, was officially installed in 1840, and confirmed the contents of the treaty with the Boers, who established their first republic in southern Africa. Also in 1840, in fulfillment of their covenant, the Boers built a church to mark the Blood River victory. 
The Battle of Blood River entered the Afrikaner psyche as a divinely-inspired victory, and December 16 became a public holiday in South Africa, celebrated each year with festivals, church services, and reenactments. The battle represented the victory of European civilization over the darkness of Africa, of Christianity over heathens. It helped justify white supremacy and the self-appointed right of Afrikaners to rule over, not apart from, the black tribes. 
Yet the Battle of Blood River, in many ways, symbolized all that was wrong with the white settlement of southern Africa, and why that experiment failed. The Boers are to be praised for wanting to settle unoccupied land peacefully, and for seeking the friendship of neighboring peoples, but neither they nor their descendents understood that demography is the arbiter of nations. Those who form the majority population of a territory will rule that territory, no matter how powerful a ruling elite may be. They will determine its culture and society. A majority-European population will create a society that reflects European values and norms. A majority-African population will create a society that reflects African norms. 
The Boers never understood this. Even at the Battle of Blood River they had at least 60 black servants and an indeterminate number of mixed-race servants, who helped load weapons. Parker, one of the Scotsman, had more than 100 black servants. 
To the present day, the overwhelming majority of Afrikaners have black servants who work on farms, in factories, and in homes. Afrikaners failed to understand that by giving the native population the benefits of European civilization, blacks would grow in numbers and overwhelm their society. The Cape Colony and the original Boer republics, which were largely uninhabited by natives when they were settled by Europeans, are today home to tens of millions of Africans. 
The Church of the Vow, built by the Boers in 1840, still stands in the town of Pietermaritzburg, named after Piet Retief. But Pietermaritzburg, supposedly the symbol of the Boer victory over the Zulus, is today part of a municipality called Umgungundhlovo, named after Dingaan‚Äôs capital. It is also the capital of the South African province of Kwa-Zulu Natal, and its population is more than 95 percent black. 
The Church of the Vow stands alone, graffiti-scarred and abandoned, in a dirty downtown slum. Its decay illustrates the fatal error made by the victors of the Battle of Blood River, that of ignoring the demographics of race. If whites had taken possession of those unoccupied lands and kept them for themselves alone the history of South Africa would have been entirely different. 
If the Boers had inhabited and worked their own land rather than rely on black labor, the states they created might still be strong and independent today. Their decision to use non-white labor was a critical error that undid all of the sacrifices of the early pioneers. 
The only way to maintain a civilization is for the majority to occupy its own land with its own people, and to do its own manual labor. This law governs the rise and fall of civilizations, and the victors of Blood River ignored it, to their cost.",1
How Hillary Courts the Black Vote,"Posted on November 6, 2016 How Hillary Courts the Black Vote Ethnomasochism reaches a new low. 
The Democratic presidential primary was one of unprecedented pandering for the non-white vote. As The Guardian summed up one of the debates: ‚ÄúHillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders made a conspicuous play for Latino and African American voters.‚Äù Mrs. Clinton won the ‚Äúconspicuous play‚Äù hands down, and with it, the nomination. The failure of Senator Sanders to win the necessary quotient of non-white votes was repeatedly pointed out by the chattering class up until the time he dropped out. 
In February one black commenter pointedly wrote that Sen. Sanders, ‚Äúhas many miles to go to convince black voters that he can fight for our interests.‚Äù By May, black commenter Steven Thrasher wrote a piece titled, ‚Äú Bernie Sanders isn‚Äôt winning minority votes ‚Äì and it‚Äôs his own fault .‚Äù Mr. Thrasher identified Sen. Sanders‚Äôs problem as ‚Äúfailing to talk about racism at every turn.‚Äù 
This accusation may seem ludicrous, since Sen. Sanders surrendered his stage to Black Lives Matter activists several times. But in comparison to Mrs. Clinton, Mr. Thrasher was right about Sen. Sanders. No mainstream candidate in the history of the United States has more thoroughly debased himself in the quest for the black vote than Mrs. Clinton. Since this helped her win the Democratic nomination, she has continued the strategy. In the few days remaining before November 8th, let‚Äôs take a look at Hillary Clinton‚Äôs most ethnomasochistic moments. 
1) In January of 2016, Mrs. Clinton was at something called the Iowa Brown and Black Forum (with none other than Jorge Ramos ), where she was asked ‚ÄúCan you tell us what the term ‚Äòwhite privilege‚Äô means to you? And can you give me an example from your life or career when you think you have benefitted from it?‚Äù This is how she began her answer: 
Where do I start? I think it is hard when you are swimming in the ocean to know exactly what is happening around you so much as it is when you‚Äôre standing on the shore perhaps watching . . . . I was born white, middle-class, in the middle of America. . . . 
2) Early in the Democratic nomination, Mrs. Clinton‚Äôs campaign released a memo aimed at stifling the rising momentum of Bernie Sanders: 
[W]hereas the electorates in Iowa and New Hampshire are largely rural/suburban and predominantly white, the March [primary] states better reflect the true diversity of the Democratic Party and the nation . . . . It will be very difficult, if not impossible, for a Democrat to win the nomination without strong levels of support among African American and Hispanic voters. We believe that‚Äôs how it should be. emphasis added 
3) Shortly before the South Carolina primary, at Schomburg Center for Research in Black Culture in Harlem, Mrs. Clinton explained how to break down barriers for African Americans: 
Ending systemic racism requires contributions from all of us‚Äîespecially those of us who haven‚Äôt experienced it ourselves. White Americans need to do a better job of listening when African Americans talk about the seen and unseen barriers that you face every day. 
We need to recognize our privilege and practice humility, rather than assume that our experiences are everyone‚Äôs experiences. All of us need to bring our skills to bear‚Äîand especially young people coming up today, who have a passion for social justice and are helping to create new ways to solve intractable problems. 
4) In April of 2016, while on a back radio show, Mrs. Clinton was asked what she always carries in her bag. She immediately answered, ‚Äúhot sauce.‚Äù When one of the black hosts noted that she would be accused of pandering to black people for giving that answer, she asked hopeully, ‚ÄúIs it working?‚Äù 
5) Just a few weeks after a Black Lives Matter supporter murdered five police officers , the Democratic National Convention that convened to nominate Mrs. Clinton passed a resolution, no doubt with her approval, supporting Black Lives Matter : 
[T]he DNC joins with Americans across the country in affirming ‚ÄòBlack lives matter‚Äô and the ‚Äòsay her name‚Äô efforts to make visible the pain of our fellow and sister Americans as they condemn extrajudicial killings of unarmed African American men, women and children. 
White politicians have tried to win elections through public displays of ethnomasochism for decades, but this election has set a new low. And if Mrs. Clinton loses, her pandering could live on in another form. As the Black Lives Matter activist Tef Poe explained , if Mr. Trump wins, ‚Äúyoung niggas such as myself are fully hell bent on inciting riots everywhere we go . . . ain‚Äôt no more rules. We‚Äôve been too nice as is.‚Äù",1
Why Obama Will Win,"Why Obama Will Win Jared Taylor, American Renaissance, August 2008 
It is time to get used to the idea that the next president of the United States will be black. Why will a nation we are so often assured is ‚Äúracist‚Äù elect a black president? And will it make a difference? 
Ever since Hillary Clinton dropped out of the race, the polls have reported consistently that Barack Obama will beat John McCain. The media love to tell us that whites say they support the black candidate and then vote for the white, but there is no reason for whites to lie in this campaign. Mr. Obama will not get a majority of the white vote but he will get enough to beat Mr. McCain. Why will so many whites vote for Mr. Obama? 
First, some support his policies. They want to end the war in Iraq, and they want the standard liberal program of socialized medicine, higher taxes, more handouts, and more government. There has always been a substantial minority of whites who vote this way, and they have a clear favorite in Mr. Obama. 
Second, as many people have pointed out, an enormous number of whites think it is deeply virtuous to vote for a black‚Äînot for an out-and-out race man such as Jesse Jackson or Al Sharpton, but for an unthreatening, well-scrubbed black who speaks standard English and promises to ‚Äúbring us together.‚Äù Even if they live sharply segregated lives, whites thrill to the language of ‚Äúcoming together,‚Äù and they adore blacks who don‚Äôt act or sound black. 
For many whites, voting for Mr. Obama will be an act of high patriotism. Electing him will prove America is not ‚Äúracist,‚Äù and many whites believe that rising above ‚Äúracism‚Äù is America‚Äôs sacred calling. One must never underestimate the importance to whites of feeling virtuous. Most would rather lose a leg than be thought a ‚Äúbigot,‚Äù and a vote for Obama is a painless way to burnish anti-racist credentials. 
Third, young whites will line up for Mr. Obama. They have been swallowing anti-white, multi-culti propaganda all their lives and have not knocked around enough to discover it is false. Some who know their parents will vote for Mr. McCain will make a special point of voting for Mr. Obama. Every new generation thinks it is cooler, hipper, and wiser than any generation that ever lived, and what could be cooler, hipper, or wiser than putting a black man in the White House? For many young whites, a vote for Mr. Obama will be a denial of every uncool, unhip, and especially every even faintly race-realist thing their parents ever said or did. 
Fourth, although the country seems to have a collective memory of no more than two weeks, Americans think everything is ‚Äúhistoric.‚Äù Whenever someone breaks an obscure record in professional baseball we are told history was made. If you ask someone why he waited in line all night to buy the first Apple iPhone he will tell you it‚Äôs a ‚Äúhistoric‚Äù product. Americans love anything that is ‚Äúhistoric,‚Äù and for people who think a few more stolen bases are ‚Äúhistory‚Äù right up there with the Battle of Lepanto, putting a black man in the White House will be the discovery of America, Pearl Harbor, and the Second Coming all rolled into one. Many whites will vote for Mr. Obama because they want to think they helped ‚Äúmake history.‚Äù 
The media, which has its own grim reasons for supporting Mr. Obama, is mesmerized by the same prospect. Editors salivate at the thought of writing headlines like ‚ÄúHistory is Made‚Äù the day after the election, and some will lose all self-control and add an exclamation mark. The emphasis, of course, will be on Mr. Obama as the first black president, implying more to come. The media, which always subtly boost the Democrat, will be even more blatantly partisan this time, downplaying every blunder Mr. Obama makes and highlighting Mr. McCain‚Äôs. 
Fifth, many whites will vote for Mr. Obama‚Äîor at least not vote for Mr. McCain‚Äîbecause the Republicans have nominated the most stunningly unattractive candidate in years. Old and pock-marked, Mr. McCain is thoroughly disliked in the Senate for arrogance that he cannot even hide from voters when he is not speaking from notes. He has dismayed Republicans by promoting amnesty for illegals, and dismayed everyone else by saying America should stay in Iraq for 100 years if it takes that long to ‚Äúwin.‚Äù Mr. Obama therefore has the enormous advantage of running against an opponent that not even Republicans like. 
Mr. Obama will also crush Mr. McCain in face-to-face debates. Mr. McCain cannot put an unscripted sentence together any better than George W. Bush can, and will come across as a thick-witted geezer. Mr. Obama, who is as glib as any politician, gives credence to H.L. Mencken‚Äôs definition of democracy as ‚Äúrule by orators.‚Äù 
But what about America‚Äôs storied ‚Äúracism‚Äù? Isn‚Äôt America brimming with people who can‚Äôt bear the thought of a black president? Americans have been numbed for decades by attractive television-blacks who read the news, forecast the weather, and tell us which brand of toothpaste to buy. Americans get a steady diet of heroic movie-blacks who outsmart and beat up white brutes, solve baffling technical problems, dispense sage advice, and save the world. Even the current Miss USA is black. There are millions of whites who do not want to live with blacks or have much to do with them, but would a black president be much different from nearly eight years of black secretaries of state? The march of blackness may be vaguely worrying to whites but they think there is nothing they can do about it and that they shouldn‚Äôt even if they could. 
The final reason why whites will vote for Mr. Obama is that the Republicans do not have the backbone to attack him in the only way that would work. If they were serious, they would fill the airways with Jeremiah Wright prancing and raving, along with the message: ‚ÄúThis is the man who married Mr. and Mrs. Obama, baptized their children, and whom Mr. Obama calls a ‚Äòfamily member‚Äô.‚Äù They would buy radio ads quoting Michelle Obama‚Äôs thesis in which she says she will always be black first and American second. Mr. McCain has nothing like the stomach for a campaign like this. 
Many blacks probably think he has the stomach for considerably worse: 57 percent think Mr. Obama is in greater physical danger than any white politician, and many say they would have warned him not to run, for fear he would be killed. An assassination would certainly be a shattering event. There is no telling how many cities would go up in flames, and Third-World countries, which have followed the Obama nomination with unprecedented interest, would help make it the most widely reported killing in history. (I have just returned from a Muslim country in which everyone has heard of Mr. Obama and likes him, but most have never heard of John McCain.) Whatever gruesome fantasies blacks may be spinning, however, assassination has gone out of style in America, and white resistance‚Äîsuch as it is‚Äîis dependably nonviolent. Mr. Obama will be perfectly safe. 
In any case, Mr. Obama will win far more white votes than he will lose because he is black. Whites who don‚Äôt want a black president would not vote for a Democrat anyway. As for black voters, even nominal Republicans are said to be running for the doors, but strictly racial voting has always been fine for blacks. Not so for whites, of course. Just try telling your co-workers that you disagree with Mr. McCain but are voting for him because he is white. 
Racially conscious whites will be in a quandary in November. Even if Mr. McCain‚Äôs policies are worse than Mr. Obama‚Äôs should they vote for the white man‚Äîone with an adopted Bangladeshi daughter and who long ago betrayed white interests? Even after years of being softened up with black heroes and figureheads, a black in the White House is a powerful symbol of white dispossession. A mulatto president is an almost explicit endorsement of miscegenation. This is bitter medicine. 
Some whites have argued that a black president would undercut the charges of ‚Äúracism‚Äù whites are forever facing, but they are dreaming. The entire government could look like a meeting of the Mystic Knights of the Sea, but as long as blacks are worse off than whites we will be blamed for it. Sensible whites cannot cheerfully vote for either man; I suspect most will stay home or vote for a minor candidate. 
Aside from the symbolic impact, which cannot be calculated, will President Obama be much different from a President Hillary Clinton? She would lard her cabinet with blacks and Hispanics, nominate ultra-liberal judges, push for amnesty, grovel before non-whites everywhere, and load up the ‚Äúcivil rights‚Äù division of the Justice Department with anti-white sharks. She would certainly make a bigger fool of herself over Hispanics and Asians (see ‚Äú Turning Up the Pressure ,‚Äù AR, May 2008). Our choice, therefore, could not be more disagreeable. On balance, we get to decide which is the more degrading spectacle: deluded white people giving their country away or clear-eyed blacks helping themselves to it. 
President Obama will, however, face special pressures. He can‚Äôt let the pushier brothers walk all over him, but he will have to throw them enough bones to keep them off his back. It will be a tricky balance. Mr. Obama‚Äôs first annual address to the NAACP will be a love feast, but every year after that it will be harder to explain why black unemployment, poverty, and incarceration rates haven‚Äôt changed at all. 
Even Mr. Obama‚Äôs star-struck white supporters will eventually wonder what happened to all that ‚Äúchange‚Äù he promised. There is not going to be change. The system is far too stuck in its self-serving ways for that. With the help of an enlarged Democratic majority in Congress, Mr. Obama may set up some wheezing, byzantine form of socialized medicine, but no one will be happy with it. If Mr. Obama inherits a sick economy, a weak dollar, expensive oil, and shrinking revenues, Americans will not at all like the change they get. 
On the bright side, with Mr. Obama we have a good chance of piquant First-Lady behavior. What will the White House be like with Michelle in charge? Will she want a new exterior paint job? How and whom will she entertain? Will the Big Man‚Äôs guest bedrooms‚Äîin the African tradition‚Äîbe turned over to third cousins from Kenya and the South Side of Chicago? There is no telling with what improprieties large and small Mrs. Obama will entertain us as she makes up her mind whether she is an American. 
It will be an edifying presidency; and whites may be a little less deluded in 2012.",1
"Last Majority White Election, Minorities to Give Democrats White House Through 2060","Last Majority White Election, Minorities to Give Democrats White House Through 2060 Paul Bedard, Washington Examiner, November 6, 2016 
This may be the last year that a Republican will be elected president, as the growth of liberal-leaning minorities all but guarantees that Democrats will hold the majority at least for the next four decades. 
That‚Äôs according to an unusual survey on the impact of minorities, mostly Latin American, done for WalletHub and provided to Secrets . 
The study used two models based on population projections and matched to the overwhelming 65 percent minority turnout for President Obama in 2012 and the underwhelming 50 percent response for George W. Bush in 2004. 
The bottom line: In no presidential election from 2020-60 do the Republicans win. {snip}

Tim Kaine Cheers End of White Majority in Spanish Address,"Tim Kaine Cheers End of White Majority in Spanish Address Julia Hahn, Breitbart, November 5, 2016 
During an Arizona speech delivered in Spanish, Sen. Tim Kaine cheered the demographic transformation of the United States caused by the nation‚Äôs federal immigration policies, telling his Latino audience on Thursday, ‚ÄúYou are the future of America.‚Äù 
‚ÄúBy 2050, communities of color will represent the majority of our population,‚Äù Kaine said. ‚ÄúSo, of course, Latinos will help shape the future of America because you are the future of America.‚Äù 
As the Pew Research Center has documented, this demographic transformation is largely the result of the changes to visa issuance policies enacted into law in 1965 that lifted the immigration controls put in place by Calvin Coolidge during the 1920s. {snip} 
{snip} 
Yet during his remarks, Kaine laid out how a Clinton administration plans to hasten the demographic transformation through expansive immigration policies that would essentially bring about the dissolution of national borders . Kaine explained how a Clinton-Kaine administration would ‚Äúend family detention,‚Äù ‚Äúclose private detention facilities,‚Äù freeze deportations, and would give citizenship‚Äìand, by extension, voting privileges and access to federal benefits‚Äìto the illegal population. 
Kaine also doubled down on his pledge to expand President Obama‚Äôs executive amnesty: 
A few months ago, the Supreme Court put DAPA on hold. That was devastating for millions of families. But it‚Äôs important to note that the Court didn‚Äôt actually rule on the substance of the case. Hillary and I have always said that DAPA is squarely within the President‚Äôs authority, and we will keep fighting for it.

Donald Trump: Minnesota Has ‚ÄòSuffered Enough‚Äô Accepting Refugees,"Donald Trump: Minnesota Has ‚ÄòSuffered Enough‚Äô Accepting Refugees Tessa Berenson, TIME, November 6, 2016 
In a pitch to suspend the nation‚Äôs Syrian refugee program , Donald Trump said Minnesotans have ‚Äúsuffered enough‚Äù from accepting Somali immigrants into their state. 
‚ÄúHere in Minnesota you have seen firsthand the problems caused with faulty refugee vetting, with large numbers of Somali refugees coming into your state, without your knowledge, without your support or approval,‚Äù Trump said at a Minneapolis rally Sunday afternoon. 
He said his administration would suspend the Syrian refugee program and not resettle refugees anywhere in the United States without support from the communities, while Hillary Clinton‚Äôs ‚Äúplan will import generations of terrorism, extremism and radicalism into your schools and throughout your communities.‚Äù

"Little-Loved by Scholars, Trump Also Gets Little of Their Cash","Little-Loved by Scholars, Trump Also Gets Little of Their Cash Peter Olsen-Phillips, Chronicle of Higher Education, November 7, 2016 
It‚Äôs no secret that campaign contributions from higher education have favored Democratic candidates for years. When it comes to the current presidential race, however, data show that the gap between left and right has grown from a rift into a chasm. 
A Chronicle analysis of Federal Election Commission data provided by the Center for Responsive Politics shows Donald Trump raising a tiny fraction of the campaign money that the previous two Republican nominees, Mitt Romney and John McCain, drew from higher-education professionals over comparable time periods. 
Across higher education, donations in congressional and Senate races showed a ratio of Democratic to Republican giving similar to that of the two previous presidential-campaign cycles. But support for Mr. Trump stood at less than 8 percent of what Senator McCain raised from higher-ed professionals, and around 4 percent of the donations that Mr. Romney pulled in over the same time period, once the figures were adjusted for inflation. 
As of June 30, faculty members and others who work in higher education had donated $76,668 to Mr. Trump‚Äôs campaign committee and to support ‚Äúsuper PACs‚Äù‚Äìindependent committees that can raise and spend unlimited funds. By comparison, people working in academe had given $6.4 million to Hillary Clinton. Those figures account for donations of at least $200 that the Center for Responsive Politics has determined come from people associated with higher education. They are the most-recent figures available.

California Set to Let Public Schools Teach Primarily in Spanish,"California Set to Let Public Schools Teach Primarily in Spanish Blake Neff, Daily Caller, November 6, 2016 
California isn‚Äôt even close to a swing state in the 2016 presidential election, but that doesn‚Äôt mean nothing is at stake for voters in the nation‚Äôs largest state. 
After Tuesday‚Äôs vote, hundreds of thousands of California schoolchildren may start attending classes primarily en espa√±ol, thanks to a voter referendum that would repeal the requirement that schools teach primarily in English. 
California‚Äôs Proposition 58 would repeal Proposition 227 , a measure that easily passed nearly two decades ago, in 1998. Proposition 227 required all public schools in the state teach ‚Äúoverwhelmingly‚Äù in English, with limited-English proficiency (LEP) students transitioning to fully English classes as quickly as possible. 
{snip} 
Across the state, the English proficiency of LEP students tripled in just a few years , and math scores rose as well. 
But now, with California‚Äôs immigrant population higher than ever, the state is poised to reverse course. 
Polls indicate the Proposition 58 is likely to pass. Ironically, supporters of the measure place an emphasis on English rather than foreign tongues. They argue that the bill will allow for ‚Äúdual immersion‚Äù programs, where both native English and native Spanish speakers can learn in a bilingual environment. In the long run, they argue, this will increase multilingualism and provide the state with a competitive advantage.

Why American Surrogates Are in Demand for Chinese Families,"Why American Surrogates Are in Demand for Chinese Families Kalee Thompson, Hollywood Reporter, November 4, 2016 
The first time Dianna Barindelli carried a baby that wasn‚Äôt her own was in 2012. ‚ÄúWe were done having kids, but I still wanted to be pregnant,‚Äù says the Modesto, Calif., stay-at-home mom, whose own daughters are 6 and 9. Barindelli signed up with the Center for Surrogate Parenting in Encino, one of the most exclusive surrogacy agencies in the world. In 2014, she matched with a Chinese couple. Unlike many agencies, CSP first shows parent applications to the surrogates, rather than the other way around. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs little things that you‚Äôll connect with people over,‚Äù says Barindelli, who was attracted to pictures of the couple‚Äôs extended travels and their traditional wedding photos. 
The embryo transfer took place in late 2014. Barindelli emailed the mom weekly, sending updates and ultrasound pictures with WeChat, an app that offers instantaneous translation. The intended parents (IPs) planned to be there for the birth, but the baby boy arrived two weeks early, 24 hours before they arrived. Says Barindelli: ‚ÄúI texted and made sure [the mom] was OK with him staying in my room. I cleared everything with her. I didn‚Äôt want her to feel bad that she wasn‚Äôt there.‚Äù 
Barindelli, who used her surrogacy fees to set up a college fund for her girls, is pregnant again, this time with the baby, due Feb. 1, of a Taiwanese couple. She may not be done: Her first Chinese couple emailed her recently, soon after their son‚Äôs first birthday. They still have frozen embryos and hope that Barindelli, now 40, will carry their second child. 
Commercial surrogacy is banned in most parts of the world, as well as in many U.S. states. Until recently, infertile couples, singles and gay would-be dads had a handful of options to turn to when it came to finding a surrogate, among them India, Thailand, Nepal and Mexico, where surrogacy services have cost a quarter of the $100,000 to $200,000 bill typical in the U.S. But in the past few years, those countries have started enforcing laws banning international surrogacy. Meanwhile, China‚Äìthe world‚Äôs most populous country, with a growing wealthy elite and where some doctors believe infertility is more common than in the U.S.‚Äìlifted its decades-long one-child policy. The result is a soaring Chinese demand for U.S. surrogacy services, one that is flourishing particularly in California, with its culturally friendly enclaves, excellent physicians and favorable state laws that regard IPs as a baby‚Äôs legal parents even before birth, if proper court documents are filed. {snip} 
{snip} Despite CSP‚Äôs Southern California location, 51 percent of its clients now are foreigners, up from 15 percent a decade ago. Rival agency Growing Generations (clients have included Sarah Jessica Parker and 30 Rock director Todd Holland) also sees half of its clients coming from overseas, as does Gifted Journeys, a boutique agency in Pasadena. At San Diego‚Äôs Expect Miracles Surrogacy, international clients account for 80 percent of IPs. And of foreigners participating in this permutation of California‚Äôs birth tourism, the number of Chinese IPs is growing the fastest, making up the most common single foreign nationality for many agencies right now. 
{snip} 
Most local agencies have a mix of Caucasian, Latina and African-American surrogates. ‚ÄúI can‚Äôt think of a time when we‚Äôve had an Asian surrogate,‚Äù says Growing Generations‚Äô Bergman. Multiple agency heads say Chinese IPs tend to strongly prefer a Caucasian surrogate. ‚ÄúPeople really have this fantasy because of a lot of the marketing that was done in China,‚Äù says Gifted Journey‚Äôs Wilson-Miller. ‚ÄúThey have this picture of blond surrogates who look like movie stars carrying the baby with their traditional families.‚Äù {snip} 
The concept of cross-race surrogacy can confound friends, family and associates of surrogates and IPs alike. In August, comedian GloZell Green, who is African-American, and her husband, also African-American, had a baby girl via a surrogate. ‚ÄúOur surrogate is a blue-eyed blonde,‚Äù the YouTube star told potential IPs gathered in a Culver City hotel in early October. People in her life ‚Äúkept asking if the baby was going to be white.‚Äù 
Surrogate selection aside, California has the added allure of numerous enclaves where families can be surrounded by Chinese speakers and businesses. ‚ÄúPeople from China can stay in Irvine, for example, and they have Chinese TV on their cable packages. Throughout California there are places they can go and shop and find stuff in Chinese. If they go to Kansas or Oklahoma? It‚Äôs total culture shock,‚Äù says Expect Miracles‚Äô Anderson. {snip} 
Of course, any baby born via surrogate in the U.S. has birthright citizenship. ‚ÄúThe Chinese couples really like that because a lot of them want to come back and forth,‚Äù says Molly O‚ÄôBrien, a fertility lawyer with offices in Torrance who frequently travels to China to participate in information sessions for would-be parents, often sponsored by doctors offices or assisted-reproduction agencies. ‚ÄúMaybe they eventually want that child to be able to go to college here.‚Äù Unlike the U.S., China forbids dual citizenship, and most American-born Chinese babies remain U.S. citizens. ‚ÄúMost Chinese couples just keep that American passport. It‚Äôs only if you want to use the government services that you‚Äôve got to be Chinese,‚Äù says CSP‚Äôs Synesiou.

Protesters Clash After Mount Greenwood Police-Involved Shooting,"Protesters Clash After Mount Greenwood Police-Involved Shooting Laura Podesta and Will Jones, ABC 7 (Chicago), November 7, 2016 
Protesters clashed Sunday afternoon near the site of a deadly police shooting of a 25-year-old man in Chicago‚Äôs Mount Greenwood neighborhood. 
Investigators said Joshua Beal, of Indianapolis, was armed when a confrontation between him and officers resulted in him being fatally shot. However, family members dispute the police narrative. 
Michael Beal, Joshua Beal‚Äôs brother, was charged with aggravated battery to a police officer, resisting arrest and attempting to disarm a police officer, a Cook County State‚Äôs Attorney spokesperson said Monday. He is scheduled to appear in court at 1:30 p.m. Tuesday. 
On Sunday, Mount Greenwood residents squared off against activists demonstrating against the shooting. The clash between Black Lives Matters and Blue Lives Matters groups became tense at times as they exchanged chants such as ‚ÄúKKK‚Äù on one side and ‚ÄúCPD‚Äù on the other side. 
{snip} 
According to police, the shooting occurred after a vehicle leaving funeral services at a nearby cemetery stopped in traffic in front of a Chicago fire house near West 111th Street and South Troy Street. An off-duty firefighter told the driver that they were illegally blocking the fire lane. The occupants exited the vehicle and a verbal/physical altercation ensured, police said. An off-duty Chicago police officer was inside a nearby business and assisted the firefighter. 
A Chicago police sergeant driving to work stopped when he observed a man with a firearm in his hands. After the man ‚Äúfailed to drop his weapon, shots were fired striking the individual multiple times,‚Äù police said. 
{snip} 
According to family, an off-duty officer in an unmarked vehicle cut off one of the vehicles in the funeral procession. The family members and officer got out of their vehicles. After a verbal exchange, gunfire erupted but Beal‚Äôs family said that he did not provoke the officer, and merely disclosing that he had a concealed weapon permit. 
{snip} 
Video circulated online on Sunday that claimed to show Beal holding a gun. 
‚ÄúThe problem is everybody is making their assumptions based on the little stuff they see, the picture, the video. No one knows what happened,‚Äù activist Ja‚ÄôMal Green said. 
The video appears to capture the tense moments before the shooting, showing at least two people with their guns out. In another video, gunshots can be heard.

German Ministry Wants Migrants Returned to Africa: Report,"German Ministry Wants Migrants Returned to Africa: Report Reuters, November 6, 2016 
The German Interior Ministry wants to stop migrants ever reaching Europe‚Äôs Mediterranean coast by picking them up at sea and returning them to Africa, the Welt am Sonntag newspaper reported on Sunday. 
In what would be a huge shift for a country with one of the most generous asylum policies, the ministry says the European Union should adopt an Australian-style system under which migrants intercepted at sea are sent for processing at camps in third countries. 
‚ÄúThe elimination of the prospect of reaching the European coast could convince migrants to avoid embarking on the life-threatening and costly journey in the first place,‚Äù the paper quoted a ministry spokeswoman as saying. 
‚ÄúThe goal must be to remove the basis for people-smuggling organizations and to save migrants from the life-threatening journey.‚Äù 
The ministry‚Äôs proposal calls for migrants picked up in the Mediterranean‚Äìmost of whom set off from conflict-torn Libya‚Äìto be sent to Tunisia, Egypt or other north African states to apply for asylum from there. 
If their asylum applications are accepted, the migrants could then be transported safely to Europe.

Russia Unveils Update of Advanced Nuclear Weapon,"Russia Unveils Update of Advanced Nuclear Weapon 10/26/2016 
EPOCH TIMES 
Russia has unveiled a new nuclear missile that ‚Äúis capable of wiping out parts of the earth the size of Texas or France.‚Äù 
Reports say that the RS-28 missile, dubbed the ‚ÄúSatan 2,‚Äù was unveiled this week, with the first image of the weapon being released to the public by designers at the Makeyev Rocket Design Bureau . It‚Äôs also known as ‚ÄúSarmat‚Äù in Russian. 
The report comes as Moscow has been flexing its military muscle amid tensions with the United States over the war in Syria and lingering fallout from the invasion of Crimea in Ukraine. NATO, meanwhile, has been shoring up its defenses in countries near Russia‚Äôs border amid concerns about its military direction. 
‚ÄúThe prospective strategic missile system is being developed in order to assuredly and effectively fulfill objectives of nuclear deterrent by Russia‚Äôs strategic forces,‚Äù according to a statement from V. Degtar and Y. Kaverin, listed as the bomb‚Äôs chief designer and leading designer, respectively, reported RT , a Russian government-funded news site. 
Earlier this year, the Kremlin-aligned Sputnik News website said the missile could ‚Äúwipe out‚Äù portions of the earth the ‚Äúsize of Texas or France.‚Äù 
The RS-28 will replace the R-36, which was called the ‚ÄúSS-18 Satan‚Äù by NATO when it was introduced in the 1970s. 
Robert Kelley, a former nuclear weapons expert at the U.S. Department of Energy, told NBC News that the new missile most likely had an upgrade in the device‚Äôs electronics, rather than an increase in its explosive payload or range.

Scientists About To Pour $100 Million Into Looking For Aliens Around Weird Star,"Scientists About To Pour $100 Million Into Looking For Aliens Around Weird Star 10/26/2016 
THE DAILY CALLER 
Astronomers are about to pour $100 million into investigating a star that may be surrounded by a large structure built by an alien civilization. 
Researchers at the University of California, Berkeley‚Äôs Breakthrough Listen project of the Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence (SETI) are turning the program‚Äôs $100 million budget into investigating the star‚Äôs unique behavior. 
‚ÄúEveryone, every SETI program telescope, I mean every astronomer that has any kind of telescope in any wavelength that can see Tabby‚Äôs star has looked at it,‚Äù Dr. Andrew Siemion, director of the Berkeley SETI Research Center, said in a press statement . ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs been looked at with Hubble, it‚Äôs been looked at with Keck, it‚Äôs been looked at in the infrared and radio and high energy, and every possible thing you can imagine, including a whole range of SETI experiments. Nothing has been found.‚Äù 
Researchers will repeatedly scan the star for eight hours per night over the next two months to examine its extremely unusually dimming behavior. The star randomly dims by as much as 22 percent of its output at extremely irregular intervals. This is consistent with large orbiting masses, much larger than planets, blocking out some of the star‚Äôs light when they pass in front of it. All the natural forms of large masses which could cause KIC 8462852‚Äôs dimming aren‚Äôt consistent with the star‚Äôs age . 
Scientists found the first possible evidence of this extraterrestrial civilization around KIC 8462852 last October , when astronomers with Yale University and other top schools published a study that used NASA‚Äôs Kepler Space Telescope. 
So far, astronomers haven‚Äôt found a single naturalistic explanation for the star‚Äôs exceedingly unusual dimming, which explains the extremely unusual behavior of the star. Astronomers have examined 500 other stars in the vicinity of KIC 8462852, and seen nothing else like it. 
The dense formations near KIC 8462852 are similar to ‚ÄúDyson Spheres,‚Äù hypothetical, are energy-harvesting ‚Äúmegastuctures‚Äù theoretical aliens could hypothetically build by rearranging the solar system. Scientists have pondered the existence of Dyson Spheres since the 1960s, thinking they could be a potential solution to energy problems faced by an extremely old civilization. SETI scientists have long argued humans could detect distant alien civilizations by looking for technological artifacts like Dyson Spheres orbiting other stars. 
‚ÄúWe spent a long time trying to convince ourselves this wasn‚Äôt real. We just weren‚Äôt able to,‚Äù Ben Montet, a Caltech astronomer who co-authored research on the star, told Gizmodo . ‚ÄúNone of the considered phenomena can alone explain the observations.‚Äù 
The best naturalistic explanation favored by astronomers, involves a huge mass of comets erratically orbiting the star and creating enough dust to dim the light, but a January analysis of the star‚Äôs history renders that hypothesis implausible, since the unprecedented dimming has continued for over a century. In order to dim for such a long time period, the star would need to have millions of times more dust and comets orbiting it than is the case. 
Astronomers estimate that the dimming would require roughly 648,000 giant comets of 200 kilometers in diameter, all aligned to pass in front of the star. The chances of such a formation render it essentially impossible, and there is currently no remotely plausible scientific explanation for what is going on with KIC 8462852. 
Astronomers have previously frequently misjudge abnormal stellar occurrences and, usually, the abnormalities are simply a new phenomenon. 
A graduate student in astronomy, found an usual pulsing radio signal so predictable it seemed to be a sign of intelligent life in 1967. The astronomers even nicknamed the signal LGM-1, for ‚Äúlittle green men,‚Äù and believed they had detected a signal from an extraterrestrial civilization , but it turned out to be the first pulsar.",1

Britain said on Wednesday it will send fighter jets to Romania next year and the United States promised troops, tanks and artillery to Poland in NATO‚Äôs biggest military build-up on Russia‚Äôs borders since the Cold War. 
Germany, Canada and other NATO allies also pledged forces at a defense ministers meeting in Brussels on the same day two Russian warships armed with cruise missiles entered the Baltic Sea between Sweden and Denmark, underscoring East-West tensions. 
In Madrid, the foreign ministry said Russia had withdrawn a request to refuel three warships in Spain‚Äôs North African enclave of Ceuta after NATO allies said they could be used to target civilians in Syria. 
The ships were part of an eight-ship carrier battle group ‚Äì including Russia‚Äôs sole aircraft carrier Admiral Kuznetsov ‚Äì that is expected to join around 10 other Russian vessels already off the Syrian coast, diplomats said. 
NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg said the troop contributions to a new 4,000-strong force in the Baltics and eastern Europe were a measured response to what the alliance believes are some 330,000 Russian troops stationed on Russia‚Äôs western flank near Moscow. 
‚ÄúThis month alone, Russia has deployed nuclear-capable Iskander missiles to Kaliningrad and suspended a weapons-grade plutonium agreement with the United States,‚Äù Stoltenberg said, also accusing Russia of continued support for rebels in Ukraine. 
Those ballistic missiles can hit targets across Poland and the Baltics, although NATO officials declined to say if Russia had moved nuclear warheads to Kaliningrad. 
NATO‚Äôs aim is to make good on a July promise by NATO leaders to deter Russia in Europe‚Äôs ex-Soviet states, after Moscow orchestrated the annexation of the Crimea peninsula in 2014. 
NATO‚Äôs plan is to set up four battle groups with a total of some 4,000 troops from early next year, backed by a 40,000-strong rapid-reaction force, and if need be, follow-on forces. 
As part of that, U.S. Secretary of Defense Ash Carter announced a ‚Äúbattle-ready battalion task force‚Äù of about 900 soldiers would be sent to eastern Poland, as well as another, separate force equipped with tanks and other heavy equipment to move across eastern Europe. 
‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a major sign of the U.S. commitment to strengthening deterrence here,‚Äù Carter said. 
Britain‚Äôs Defence Secretary Michael Fallon said Britain would send an 800-strong battalion to Estonia, supported by French and Danish troops, starting from May. The United States wants its troops in position by June. 
London is also sending Typhoon fighter aircraft to Romania to patrol around the Black Sea, partly in support of Turkey. 
‚ÄúAlthough we are leaving the European Union, we will be doing more to help secure the eastern and southern flanks of NATO,‚Äù Fallon said. 
SYRIAN SHADOW 
Others NATO allies joined the four battle groups led by the United States, Germany, Britain and Canada to go to Poland, Lithuania, Estonia and Latvia. Canada said it was sending 450 troops to Latvia, joined by 140 military personnel from Italy. 
Germany said it was sending between 400 and 600 troops to Lithuania, with additional forces from the Netherlands, Norway, Belgium, Croatia and Luxembourg. 
Stoltenberg said allies‚Äô commitments would be ‚Äúa clear demonstration of our transatlantic bond.‚Äù Diplomats said it would also send a message to Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump, who has complained that European allies do not pay their way in the alliance. 
For the Kremlin, the U.S.-led alliance‚Äôs plans are already too much given Russia‚Äôs grievances at NATO‚Äôs expansion eastwards, although Stoltenberg denied going too far. 
But NATO‚Äôs troop announcements in the Baltic states and Poland were partly overshadowed by the dispute about whether Spain should refuel the Russian warships, which was later resolved by Moscow‚Äôs decision to withdraw its request. 
NATO‚Äôs tensions with Russia have been building since Crimea and the West‚Äôs decision to impose retaliatory sanctions. 
But the breakdown of a U.S-Russia brokered ceasefire in Syria on Oct. 3, followed by U.S. accusations that Russia has used cyber attacks to disrupt the presidential election, have signaled a worsening of ties. 
Even before the break down of the Syrian ceasefire, Russian President Vladimir Putin suspended a treaty with Washington on cleaning up weapons-grade plutonium, signaling he was willing to use nuclear disarmament as a new bargaining chip in disputes with the United States over Ukraine and Syria.

Russia And NATO Engage In One Of The Largest Military Build-Ups Since The Cold War,"  
DAILY CALLER 
  330,000 Russian troops amassing along European borders. 
NATO will contribute a 4,000-strong force to bolster the defenses of its members in the Baltic states and eastern Europe. Four battle groups will be created out of forces by early next year. The battle groups will be bolstered by a 40,000-strong reaction force, and various reinforcements as needed. The plan is the fulfillment of a promise to increase the defenses of former Soviet-bloc members under threat from Russian aggression. 
‚ÄúThis month alone, Russia is deploying nuclear-capable Iskander missiles to Kaliningrad and suspending a weapons-grade plutonium agreement with the United States,‚Äù said Stoltenberg Wednesday while attending a meeting of NATO defense ministers in Brussels, Belgium. The deployment of the missiles to Kaliningrad, a small Russian satellite territory located between Poland and Lithuania, puts Poland and the Baltic states directly in Russia‚Äôs sights. 
U.S. Secretary of Defense Ash Carter announced a battalion of 900 ‚Äúbattle-ready‚Äù soldiers will be deployed to eastern Poland as part of the new commitment. British Defense Secretary Michael Fallon said his country will be sending a battalion of 800 soldiers to Estonia, in addition to a contingent of Typhoon fighter aircraft to Romania. Canada plans to send 450 troops to Latvia, backed by 140 Italians. Germany will contribute 400 to 600 troops to Lithuania. 
Russia steadily built up its military presence on the European border for several months. Russian Defense Minister Sergey Shoigu announced a plan to recruit 30,000 additional forces to be stationed on Russia‚Äôs eastern flank in May, followed by the deployment of the Iskander missiles to Kaliningrad in early October. 
The massive military build-up represents one of the largest since the Cold War, and comes at a time when tensions between the West and Moscow at are dangerously tense.

Reuters Donald Trump‚Äôs Hollywood Walk of Fame star vandalized on video,"Reuters Donald Trump‚Äôs Hollywood Walk of Fame star vandalized on video 10/27/2016 
REUTERS 
Donald Trump‚Äôs star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame was defaced by a vandal wielding a sledgehammer and a pick-axe on Wednesday in an act captured on video, police said. 
Los Angeles police expect to arrest someone for the vandalism, which left Trump‚Äôs name scratched out of the star, the emblem in the middle dislodged and chips missing. 
A video posted at Deadline.com, a Hollywood media industry website, showed a man wearing a hard-hat and reflective vest swinging a sledgehammer and pick-axe in the pre-dawn darkness. 
The area had been cordoned off with traffic barriers and cones, giving it the appearance of a legitimate work site. 
The Republican presidential nominee, real estate developer and reality TV star has faced several large protests during his campaign appearances in California, where polls show him far behind Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton. 
The former host of the NBC show ‚ÄúThe Apprentice,‚Äù Trump received his Walk of Fame star in 2007. A spokeswoman for Trump could not be reached for comment. 
Los Angeles police spokeswoman Liliana Preciado at the scene confirmed investigators have video capturing the vandalism attack and she said police expected to arrest whoever was responsible. 
Los Angeles-based City News Service reported a man identifying himself as James Lambert Otis said he damaged the installation ‚Äúto make a point.‚Äù 
City News reported the man said he had family members who were victims of sexual assault and had intended to remove the star, which he was unable to do, and auction it off to benefit women who have alleged Trump groped them. Trump has denied the allegations. 
Otis could not be reached for comment on the report. 
Trump drew widespread condemnations from voters and a number of Republican elected officials after a 2005 video emerged in which he was heard talking on an open microphone about groping women and trying to seduce a married woman. 
His star on the Walk of Fame was previously targeted. 
In the summer, a street artist erected a tiny wall around the star, complete with miniature American flags and barbed wire. The art piece, which was later removed, made light of Trump‚Äôs campaign pledge to build a wall along the U.S. border with Mexico. 
The Hollywood Chamber of Commerce administers the hundreds of star plaques on sidewalks in the Los Angeles neighborhood. They are purchased for $30,000 each. 
Leron Gubler, president and CEO of the chamber, said in a statement the star would be covered for several days during repairs.",1
New Las Vegas Casino ONLY for Chinese Gamblers,"New Las Vegas Casino ONLY for Chinese Gamblers 10/27/2016 
LOS ANGELES TIMES 
Casino operators know there are no gamblers quite like the Chinese. 
With their affinity for baccarat, the most lucrative game in Las Vegas, Chinese gamblers have long commanded special treatment ‚Äî be it with private Chinese gaming salons, Lunar New Year festivities or performances from pop stars flown in from Hong Kong and Taiwan. 
No one in Las Vegas, however, has built a casino and hotel strictly for Chinese visitors until now. 
The Lucky Dragon Hotel & Casino is billing itself as Las Vegas‚Äô first Asian-themed resort, funded in large part by Chinese investors. The property, set to open Dec. 3 with a traditional lion dance, will offer bilingual staff and signage, a luxury tea bar and a host of restaurants with food that wouldn‚Äôt look or taste out of place in Guangzhou or Shanghai. 
‚ÄúNo General Tso‚Äôs or egg rolls here,‚Äù said David Jacoby, chief operating officer for the resort, which left no Chinese superstition unturned. 
The rose-colored resort‚Äôs front entrance is designed in a dragon motif. A feng shui master blessed its kitchens. The main bar is eight-sided for good fortune. And it‚Äôs hard to find a No. 4 on the property. The unlucky digit is absent from room numbers and the phone directory. The nine-story hotel even skips a fourth floor. 
‚ÄúThis place is heavily feng shui‚Äôed‚Äù Jacoby said. 
With all that attention to detail, you‚Äôd think Lucky Dragon‚Äôs brain trust was born in Beijing. But the idea behind the 203-room boutique resort off the northern end of the Las Vegas Strip was largely conceived by an American veteran gaming executive, Bill Weidner, the former president and chief operating officer of Las Vegas Sands Corp. 
Weidner, an advisor to Lucky Dragon, is no neophyte to the Chinese market. He worked with some of China‚Äôs most powerful government figures to lead Sands‚Äô expansion into Macau when the former Portuguese colony relaxed its monopoly on gaming licenses in 2002. Macau now generates nearly five times the gambling revenue of the Las Vegas Strip, forever changing the fortunes of the global casino industry. 
Weidner was also involved in the development of the $5.5-billion Marina Bay Sands in Singapore before leaving the company in a bitter dispute in 2009. 
Weidner and Jacoby know major Las Vegas gaming resorts like the Sands‚Äô Venetian, MGM or Wynn already cater to China‚Äôs high rollers with VIP parlors and relationships forged in Macau. 
Lucky Dragon, though tiny compared with those properties, addresses what they see as a gap in the market: middle-class Chinese gamblers, Chinese Americans as well as the broader Asian American community. 
‚ÄúLet them fight over the 1% and let us fight over the remaining 99%,‚Äù said Jacoby, who previously worked for Weidner‚Äôs firm, Global Gaming Asset Management, opening a casino resort in the Philippines. 
That pool of Chinese gamers will almost certainly grow. On Dec. 2, Hainan Airlines will fly the first direct flights from China to Las Vegas‚Äôs McCarran International Airport (Lucky Dragon guests are confirmed to be on that flight, Jacoby said). 
Already, a record 206,743 visitors from China traveled to Las Vegas last year, nearly double the number in 2010, according to the Las Vegas Convention and Visitors Authority. 
Meanwhile, ground was broken on another Asian-themed resort, this one much bigger than Lucky Dragon. Resorts World, a Malaysian hospitality and casino giant with decades of Asian gaming experience, is spending up to $4 billion for a 3,200-room property on the North Strip that will feature Chinese architecture such as an ersatz Great Wall. It‚Äôs slated to open in 2019. 
Plans are also underway to build a $2-billion resort on the Strip called Alon Las Vegas. The project is owned by Australia‚Äôs Crown Resort, who count Chinese gamers as a major source of business. 
‚ÄúIt‚Äôs going to be even more of a competitive market,‚Äù said John DeCree, an analyst at Union Gaming in Las Vegas. ‚ÄúEveryone‚Äôs coming for the same customer. It‚Äôs going to be a challenge.‚Äù With 203 rooms, the hotel is small compared with many on the Strip. But with five restaurants, it offers more dining options than many its size. (Isaac Brekken / For The Times) 
Competition could also be fierce for Chinese high rollers, whose gambling activity has been curtailed by a slowing Chinese economy and an anti-corruption campaign at home that, until recently, sent Macau gambling revenues into a two-year slump. 
Las Vegas isn‚Äôt immune to those headwinds. After years of explosive growth, casinos on the Strip experienced a decline in the amount of money bet on baccarat to about $10 billion in 2015. That‚Äôs nearly $2 billion less than 2014, according to the Nevada Gaming Control Board. 
The casino industry uses the card game as a proxy for Chinese gambling activity because of its massive popularity within the culture. That‚Äôs both for practical and superstitious reasons. Baccarat has the best statistical odds of beating the house compared with other games. And as a game of chance over skill, baccarat also plays into Chinese fatalistic attitudes toward luck. 
‚ÄúThe vast majority of baccarat play comes from the Asian market,‚Äù said Jacoby of Lucky Dragon. 
Jacoby‚Äôs casino will offer seven VIP baccarat tables on a second-floor terrace with access to a vast menu of authentic Chinese food. In addition to live seafood flown in from all over the world, the property will serve staples like congee, wonton noodles and dim sum. 
Food is expected to be a big draw because Chinese vacationers overwhelmingly prefer their native cuisine over others. 
Las Vegas has a number of well-regarded Chinese restaurants such as Ping Pang Pong at Gold Coast Hotel & Casino, China MaMa in Chinatown and an outpost of Chengdu Taste, the San Gabriel Valley stalwart for Sichuan cuisine. High-end Chinese food is also served at high-roller rooms such as the Venetian‚Äôs Paiza Club. 
No casino, however, boasts the concentration of Chinese restaurants that Lucky Dragon will, with five altogether. The hope is Chinese tourists staying at other properties will choose to eat ‚Äî and gamble ‚Äî at Lucky Dragon when they venture off the Strip. 
The emphasis on food means Lucky Dragon‚Äôs owners can eschew things that aren‚Äôt particularly important to Chinese tourists, like a whiskey bar or nightclub. And because Chinese tourists often don‚Äôt like to sunbathe, Lucky Dragon‚Äôs pool isn‚Äôt much bigger than the backyard variety. 
Jacoby says his competitors on the Strip offer Chinese gamers a diluted experience by operating a handful of Chinese restaurants and parlors in mega-casinos that have to serve all manner of people, not just Chinese. By comparison, visitors to Lucky Dragon can start conversing in Mandarin with staff as soon as they walk in, he said. 
‚ÄúWe‚Äôre trying to take [the Asian gaming experience] and bring that front and center instead of hiding the most valuable customer in a segregated portion of a large building,‚Äù Jacoby said. 
Though Lucky Dragon will rely heavily on Asian American customers at first, its funding was largely drawn from mainland Chinese investors through the federal EB-5 visa program. The visa allows foreigners and their immediate family to gain permanent U.S. residency in exchange for a minimum investment of $500,000 that also creates American jobs. Rather than focusing on bars and nightclubs, the casino is prioritizing dining options. That includes a tea room, still under construction. (Isaac Brekken / For The Times) 
Chinese investors have dominated the program nationwide, accounting for 80% of applicants awaiting EB-5 visas. Though occasionally subject to fraud, the program has successfully funded a handful of mixed-used projects in New York, the JW Marriott hotel at L.A. Live and the SLS Hotel & Casino across from Lucky Dragon. 
Jacoby declined to say how many Chinese investors are involved in Lucky Dragon, which is expected to employ 800 people. Jacoby also declined to disclose how much the project cost, adding that earlier media reports pegging the price tag at about $370 million were inaccurate. 
The company hit a snag last year when it unsuccessfully sought tax subsidies from the city. But financial commitments from Weidner‚Äôs family and others put the project back on track. 
Lucky Dragon isn‚Äôt the first Las Vegas resort to target a specific demographic. The Hard Rock Hotel & Casino and the Palms Casino Resort opened years ago catering to young partygoers and clubbers before eventually being overshadowed by larger competitors on the Strip such as the MGM Grand and the Cosmopolitan. 
Lucky Dragon‚Äôs early backers even considered building an LGBT resort before settling on their current strategy, one they say will live and die on being able to deliver an authentic Chinese gambling experience. 
‚ÄúWe set out trying to put together a place that would stand alone in Shanghai if you dropped it off down there today,‚Äù Jacoby said. ‚ÄúWe didn‚Äôt want to [have] just gongs, Asian tapestries and caricature-stuff like that.‚Äù",1
World wildlife ‚Äòfalls by 58% in 40 years‚Äô,"World wildlife ‚Äòfalls by 58% in 40 years‚Äô 10/27/2016 
BBC NEWS Global wildlife populations have fallen by 58% since 1970, a report says. 
The Living Planet assessment, by the Zoological Society of London (ZSL) and WWF, suggests that if the trend continues that decline could reach two-thirds among vertebrates by 2020. 
The figures suggest that animals living in lakes, rivers and wetlands are suffering the biggest losses. 
Human activity, including habitat loss, wildlife trade, pollution and climate change contributed to the declines. 
Dr Mike Barrett. head of science and policy at WWF, said: ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs pretty clear under ‚Äòbusiness as usual‚Äô we will see continued declines in these wildlife populations. But I think now we‚Äôve reached a point where there isn‚Äôt really any excuse to let this carry on. 
‚ÄúWe know what the causes are and we know the scale of the impact that humans are having on nature and on wildlife populations ‚Äì it really is now down to us to act.‚Äù 
However the methodology of the report has been criticised. Image copyright CARLOS DREWS / WWF Image caption The report looked at data collected on 3,700 species of vertebrates over the last 40 years 
The Living Planet Report is published every two years and aims to provide an assessment of the state of the world‚Äôs wildlife. 
For freshwater species alone, the decline stands at 81% since 1970 Dr Mike Barrett, WWF 
This analysis looked at 3,700 different species of birds, fish, mammals, amphibians and reptiles ‚Äì about 6% of the total number of vertebrate species in the world. 
The team collected data from peer-reviewed studies, government statistics and surveys collated by conservation groups and NGOs. 
Any species with population data going back to 1970, with two or more time points (to show trends) was included in the study. 
The researchers then analysed how the population sizes had changed over time. 
Some of this information was weighted to take into account the groups of animals that had a great deal of data (there are many records on Arctic and near Arctic birds, for example) or very little data (tropical amphibians, for example). The report authors said this was to make sure a surplus of information about declines in some animals did not skew the overall picture. 
The last report, published in 2014, estimated that the world‚Äôs wildlife populations had halved over the last 40 years. 
This assessment suggests that the trend has continued: since 1970, populations have declined by an average of 58%. 
Dr Barrett said some groups of animals had fared worse than others. 
‚ÄúWe do see particularly strong declines in the freshwater environment ‚Äì for freshwater species alone, the decline stands at 81% since 1970. This is related to the way water is used and taken out of fresh water systems, and also the fragmentation of freshwater systems through dam building, for example.‚Äù 
It also highlighted other species, such as African elephants , which have suffered huge declines in recent years with the increase in poaching, and sharks, which are threatened by overfishing. 
If pressures ‚Äì overexploitation, illegal wildlife trade for example ‚Äì increase or worsen, then that trend may be worse Dr Robin Freeman, ZSL 
The researchers conclude that vertebrate populations are declining by an average of 2% each year, and warn that if nothing is done, wildlife populations could fall by 67% (below 1970 levels) by the end of the decade. 
Dr Robin Freeman, head of ZSL‚Äôs Indicators & Assessments Unit, said: ‚ÄúBut that‚Äôs assuming things continue as we expect. If pressures ‚Äì overexploitation, illegal wildlife trade, for example ‚Äì increase or worsen, then that trend may be worse. 
‚ÄúBut one of the things I think is most important about these stats, these trends are declines in the number of animals in wildlife populations ‚Äì they are not extinctions. By and large they are not vanishing, and that presents us with an opportunity to do something about it.‚Äù Image copyright SCOTT DICKERSON Image caption There are still many gaps in our knowledge of the world‚Äôs vertebrates 
However, Living Planet reports have drawn some criticisms. 
There are some numbers [in the report] that are sensible, but there are some numbers that are very very sketchy Stuart Pimm, Duke University 
Stuart Pimm, professor of conservation ecology at Duke University in the United States, said that while wildlife was in decline, there were too many gaps in the data to boil population loss down to a single figure. 
‚ÄúThere are some numbers [in the report] that are sensible, but there are some numbers that are very, very sketchy,‚Äù he told BBC News. 
‚ÄúFor example, if you look at where the data comes from, not surprisingly, it is massively skewed towards western Europe. 
‚ÄúWhen you go elsewhere, not only do the data become far fewer, but in practice they become much, much sketchier‚Ä¶ there is almost nothing from South America, from tropical Africa, there is not much from the tropics, period. Any time you are trying to mix stuff like that, it is is very very hard to know what the numbers mean. 
‚ÄúThey‚Äôre trying to pull this stuff in a blender and spew out a single number‚Ä¶. It‚Äôs flawed.‚Äù 
But Dr Freeman said the team had taken the best data possible from around the world. 
‚ÄúIt‚Äôs completely true that in some regions and in some groups, like tropical amphibians for example, we do have a lack of data. But that‚Äôs because there is a lack of data. 
‚ÄúWe‚Äôre confident that the method we are using is the best method to present an overall estimate of population decline. 
‚ÄúIt‚Äôs entirely possible that species that aren‚Äôt being monitored as effectively may be doing much worse ‚Äì but I‚Äôd be very surprised if they were doing much better than we observed. ‚Äú",1

Computers that can read your MIND and convert your thoughts,"Computers that can read your MIND and convert your thoughts 10/27/2016 
THE DAILY MAIL Voice-recognition technology can be useful for dictating text when you have no way of typing. But computers could soon be able to decode your thoughts into actual speech or written words, without you even saying a word. This kind of technology sounds like science fiction, but there are a variety of ways scientists are edging towards making it a reality, according to a new review. Computers that can read our minds might enhance the capabilities of already existing speech interfaces with devices, like Siri and Ok Google. But it could be even more important for those with speech difficulties, and even more so for patients who lack any speech or motor function at all. ‚ÄòSo instead of saying ‚ÄúSiri, what is the weather like today‚Äù or ‚ÄúOk Google, where can I go for lunch?‚Äù I just imagine saying these things,‚Äô said Christian Herff, author of a review recently published in the journal Frontiers in Human Neuroscience . Reading someone‚Äôs thoughts might still belong to the realms of science fiction, but scientists are already decoding speech from signals generated in our brains when we speak or listen to someone talking. In the new study, Mr Herff and co-author Dr Tanja Schultz, both from the Karlsruhe Institute of Technology, compared the pros and cons of using various brain imaging techniques to take neural signals from the brain and decode them to text. There are a variety of technologies out there, the authors said, including functional MRI and near infrared imaging that detect neural signals based on the metabolic activity of neurons. Another method can detect electromagnetic activity of neurons responding to speech. But there was one method in particular, called electrocorticography, which stood out in the new review, the authors said. This technique uses a brain-to-text system. demonstrated on epilepsy patients who already had electrode grids implanted for treatment of their condition. The patients read out texts presented on a screen in front of them while their brain activity was recorded. This formed the basis of a database of patterns of neural signals that could now be matched to speech elements or ‚Äòphones‚Äô. When the researchers included language and dictionary models in their algorithms, they were able to decode neural signals to text with a high degree of accuracy. There are a variety of technologies out there, the authors said, including functional MRI (stock image pictured) and near infrared imaging that detect neural signals based on the metabolic activity of neurons COULD HACKERS GET INSIDE YOUR BRAIN? Experts at the University of Washington have revealed how hackers could inserting images into dodgy apps and recording our brain‚Äôs unintentional reaction using brain-computer interfaces. For example, when playing a video game users may see logos of familiar brands pop-up on the screen that just vanish. Hackers put those images in the game and they were recording your ‚Äòbrain‚Äôs unintentional response to them‚Äô using a BCI, which can be a wearable device that monitors stress levels or a cap covered in electrodes. This technology could one day be used by advertisers to gather more information about their customers. Also, police officers and government officials could use this method to convict criminals or as a ‚Äòremote lie detector test‚Äô. ‚ÄòFor the first time, we could show that brain activity can be decoded specifically enough to use ASR (automated speech recognition) technology on brain signals,‚Äô said Mr Herff. ‚ÄòHowever, the current need for implanted electrodes renders it far from usable in day-to-day life.‚Äô To go from here to a functioning thought-detection device will still require some work. ‚ÄòA first milestone would be to actually decode imagined phrases from brain activity, but a lot of technical issues need to be solved for that,‚Äô said Herff. Earlier this year researchers at the University of Rochester revealed a computer program that searches for the brain activity related to certain words and then use this to predict a sentence being thought, even it hasn‚Äôt seen it before. They said the system is able to get the predictions right around 70 per cent of the time. Dr Andrew Anderson, a research fellow at the University of Rochester who led the study, said the technology could be used to help people who have suffered from a stroke to communicate. The researchers, whose study was published in the journal Cerebral Cortex, used brain scans taken with functional magnetic resonance imaging from 14 participants as they silently read 240 unique sentences.",1

The future of TV might everyone taking hallucinogenic drugs, according to the head of Netflix. 
The threats to the streaming TV company might not be Amazon or other streaming services, but instead ‚Äúpharmacological‚Äù ways of entertaining people, Reed Hastings has said. 
And just as films and TV shows are a supposedly improved version of other entertainments, those same things might eventually become defunct, he said. In the same way that the cinema and TV screen made ‚Äúthe opera and the novel‚Äù much smaller, something else might be on the way to do the same thing, the Netflix boss said at a Wall Street Journal event. 
Those challenges could come from anywhere, he said. They might not be another form of screen: ‚ÄúIs it VR, is it gaming, is it pharmacological?‚Äù Mr Hastings asked the event. 
He went on to say that it might be possible that in the coming years someone will develop a drug that will make people get the same experiences that at the moment come from streaming services like Netflix. Apparently making reference to The Matrix, he said that we might be able to take one pill to escape into a hallucination and then another to come back. 
‚ÄúIn twenty or fifty years, taking a personalized blue pill you just hallucinate in an entertaining way and then a white pill brings you back to normality is perfectly viable,‚Äù Mr Hastings said. ‚ÄúAnd if the source of human entertainment in thirty or forty years is pharmacological we‚Äôll be in real trouble.‚Äù 
His references to The Matrix ‚Äì and to being in ‚Äútrouble‚Äù ‚Äì recall arguments that have recently been made by tech billionaires including Elon Musk and Sam Altman. Both have suggested that it might be possible that we are part of a simulated universe ‚Äì something that they said might be part of a virtual reality world, but could just as easily be the result of a drug-induced hallucination. 
Mr Hastings didn‚Äôt indicate whether or not Netflix would look to make such drugs itself, or how it would fend off any companies that did. But it does sound a little like something out Black Mirror, which Netflix is showing the new season of at the moment.",1
Obama Admits to Rigged Elections back in 2008,"Obama Admits to Rigged Elections back in 2008 10/27/2016 
TRUTH REVOLT 
There‚Äôs a lot of accusations going around that the 2016 election is rigged. From Democrats suggesting Russia is tampering with the presidential election to a plethora of documents and undercover video that proves Democrats are trying their darnedest to sway the outcome. 
President Obama has laughed off the notion that Bernie Sanders was forced out by the DNC and believes Donald Trump is out of his mind for suggesting elections are rigged. And of course, Obama would never admit that Hillary Clinton could do something wrong. But candidate Obama, in 2008, sure was concerned that the election might be rigged against him. 
Video of him answering a campaign question has surfaced to put to rest the notion that he doesn‚Äôt believe in the possibility: 
‚ÄúWell, I tell you what: it helps in Ohio that we‚Äôve got Democrats in charge of the machines. [Cheering] But look, I come from Chicago, so I want to be honest, it‚Äôs not as if it‚Äôs just Republicans who have monkeyed around with elections in the past, sometimes Democrats have too. You know, whenever people are in power, they‚Äôre ‚Äî you know, they have this tendency to try to, you know, tilt things in their direction.‚Äù 
Watch above. 
The Freedom Center is a 501c3 non-profit organization. Therefore we do not endorse political candidates either in primary or general elections. However, as defenders of America‚Äôs social contract, we insist that the rules laid down by both parties at the outset of campaigns be respected, and that the results be decided by free elections. We will oppose any attempt to rig the system and deny voters of either party their constitutional right to elect candidates of their choice.",1

Tokyo could ban US troops from stationing on disputed isles,"  
  block the US from being stationed on the islands off Hokkaido in the strategic Sea of Okhotsk, if this helps persuade Russia to give them back. 
The islands are inhabited, and in Russia are called the Southern Kurils ‚Äì but for Japan they are Etorofu, Kunashiri, Shikotan, and the Habomai islet group. These territories, which became Russian after Japan‚Äôs defeat in World War II under the San Francisco Peace Treaty of 1951, saw a rift between the two countries preventing them from signing the peace treaty to formally end the war. Tokyo insists the four islets are not part of the Kuril chain and should be returned under its control. 
In September, Russian President Vladimir Putin told Bloomberg that Russia does not ‚Äútrade territories.‚Äù But ahead of his visit to Tokyo in mid-December, Japan‚Äôs diplomatic sources told Kyodo News that Moscow would hand over Shikotan and Habomai islet group following the peace deal, as stated by the 1956 Japan-Soviet Joint Declaration. 
The sources, however, said Russia may be concerned that the US military could be stationed on the territories after Japan gets them back. According to Article 5 of the Japan-US security treaty, Washington is allowed to station its troops in areas administered by Japan. 
The Japanese government is now looking into the potential consequences, should they exclude the islands from Article 5, the sources said, with one of them adding that Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe could go as far as announcing that the islands do not fall under Article 5. 
Other sources, however, think that ‚Äúa realistic scenario is that the prime minister shows his political will and seeks consent from the United States.‚Äù 
At the same time, ‚ÄúRussia won‚Äôt agree to hand over [the islands] unless the possibility of stationing the US military there is ruled out,‚Äù a source familiar with the Japanese-Russian ties told The Japan Times over the weekend. 
Nevertheless, convincing the US to okay such conditions seems very difficult, a Japanese government source said, adding that ‚ÄúIt could even shake the foundations of the [Japan-US military] alliance.‚Äù 
For Russia, the area around the disputed islands is of ‚Äúextremely high importance‚Äù because it faces the Sea of Okhotsk, a Japanese government source said, and a foreign military in these waters could hamper both essential military drills and the use of a major access route to the Pacific Ocean. 
Tokyo has already rejected the report, saying they are not planning to review Article 5, TASS news agency said, citing Prime Minister Shinzo Abe. Japanese Foreign Minister Fumio Kishida reiterated it, adding that the Japan-US treaty ‚Äúapplies and will apply‚Äù to all territories and waters which are administered by Japan. 
Earlier in the month, Tokyo also denied Nikkei‚Äôs report that Japan and Russia were discussing joint administration of the Kuril Islands. 
‚ÄúThere is no change in Japan‚Äôs fundamental position that Japan will conclude the peace treaty with Russia by resolving the issue of the possession of the four northern islands,‚Äù Japanese Foreign Ministry spokesman Yasuhira Kawamura told Reuters in an email at that time. 
Russia has always insisted that any change in the status of the islands is out of the question, as it would constitute a reassessment of the results of World War II, which is expressly banned by international treaties.",1
41 Days And 8 Months Later: Dissecting The Oregon Standoff Trial,"41 Days And 8 Months Later: Dissecting The Oregon Standoff Trial 10/31/2016 
OPB 
In the shadow of trees covering Chapman Square park in downtown Portland, four of seven defendants acquitted of conspiracy in the occupation of the Malheur National Wildlife Refuge posed for pictures. 
David Fry smiled as he flashed a peace sign. He slung his arms around co-defendants Neil Wampler ‚Äî clutching a hotdog from the victory barbecue and a stack of newspapers with his face on them ‚Äî and Shawna Cox. Jeff Banta stood to the far right. An alternate juror named Sarah Foultner stood between them while a supporter cycled through phones to capture the moment for everyone. 
The prosecution didn‚Äôt picture the trial ending like this. 
‚ÄúDisappointing,‚Äù said U.S. Attorney for Oregon Billy Williams of the not guilty verdicts. ‚ÄúBitterly so.‚Äù 
Just as quickly as the defense proclaimed a victory for rural America, occupation opponents dubbed the result an embarrassing loss for the prosecution. And supporters of other movements ‚Äî #BlackLivesMatter and #NoDAPL to name two ‚Äî wondered aloud about the meaning of justice. 
But 41 days and eight months later, the leaders of the armed occupation in eastern Oregon were found not guilty by a jury of peers. 
Still, questions remain: How did it happen? And what happens next? Ammon Bundy Hometown: Emmett, Idaho NOT GUILTY 
Leader of the Malheur refuge occupation. Before Oregon, Ammon Bundy was less prominent than his siblings in protesting the federal government. Ryan Bundy Hometown: Cedar City, Utah NOT GUILTY 
Eldest of Nevada rancher Cliven Bundy‚Äôs 14 children. Worked alongside his brother, Ammon Bundy, as a leader of the Malheur occupation. The Charges 
Ammon Bundy, Ryan Bundy and five others were charged with conspiracy to impede federal employees from doing their jobs by force, threat or intimidation. 
‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a favorite charge of prosecutors,‚Äù said Portland defense attorney Kevin Sali before the trial began. ‚ÄúWhen people are involved in a conspiracy they can be liable ‚Ä¶ for things their co-conspirators did.‚Äù 
The Bundys, Fry, Banta and Cox also faced weapons charges. (Prosecutors dropped those against Cox .) Ryan Bundy and Kenneth Medenbach were also charged with theft of government property. Internet radio show host Pete Santilli also faced a conspiracy charge but it was later dropped . 
The jury found the defendants not guilty on all but one charge. They failed to reach consensus on Ryan Bundy‚Äôs theft charge stemming from the removal of government surveillance cameras at the refuge. 
In light of the verdict, questions swirled about whether the prosecution brought the proper charges. 
Williams, the U.S. Attorney for Oregon, said prosecutors could have brought criminal trespass charges and tried the occupiers in state court. But misdemeanor trespassing didn‚Äôt seem to pass for muster ‚Äî prosecutors wanted to bring felonies. 
‚ÄúIf there had been some other federal statute that specifically addresses the conduct, we would have considered using it,‚Äù Williams said in an interview with OPB‚Äôs Amelia Templeton . ‚ÄúWe have and still believe we brought the most applicable and appropriate charges under the evidence, which is our duty.‚Äù A watch tower at the Malheur National Wildlife Refuge. Andy Dunbar, a rancher who lives adjacent to the refuge, explained his view of the occupation in court. Amelia Templeton/OPB The Prosecution 
Some described the prosecution‚Äôs case as a ‚Äúslam dunk.‚Äù In basketball, a slam dunk is a show of force. 
Mike Arnold, Ammon Bundy‚Äôs previous attorney, told OPB‚Äôs Anna Griffin he thinks the prosecution brought felony charges to make a powerful statement with ‚Äúserious prison time.‚Äù 
‚ÄúTheir goal is to prevent any sort of activity like this in the future from the actual defendants themselves and other like-minded folks,‚Äù Arnold said. 
Prosecutors brought mounds of evidence to the table ‚Äî sometimes literally, like when they brought a large display of firearms and ammunition into the courtroom. 
And rarely did defendants dispute the facts of the case. They admitted to illegally taking over a federal facility, even to bringing their arms. 
‚ÄúIt didn‚Äôt bother me to be arrested because I‚Äôm where I want to be right now,‚Äù Medenbach said on the stand . ‚ÄúLike the Bundys, I‚Äôve been called by a higher power ‚Ä¶ we all know this is what God called us to do.‚Äù 
But prosecutors missed the dunk. And just like in basketball, a missed dunk in the courtroom can be humiliating. 
Juror No. 4 ‚Äî who earlier sparked a fellow juror‚Äôs dismissal by questioning his impartiality ‚Äî wrote the Oregonian/OregonLive saying the prosecution came off as arrogant in its case. 
‚ÄúThe air of triumphalism that the prosecution brought was not lost on any of us,‚Äù the juror wrote. 
The prosecution moved through its case quickly. Prosecutors rested after 13 days. They cross-examined Ammon Bundy for just 15 minutes . Their closing argument lasted less than two hours. 
Williams admitted the hurry with which prosecutors prepared their case may have hurt it. He called the legal timeline ‚Äúextraordinary.‚Äù 
The prosecution focused heavily on the occupiers‚Äô intent behind the refuge takeover. But the jury ultimately determined the prosecution failed to prove impeding federal employees was the occupiers‚Äô goal ‚Äî even if the occupation actually did impede employees. The Defense 
Matt Schindler, Medenbach‚Äôs hybrid counsel, delivered a thunderous closing argument on Oct. 19. 
The charge all seven occupiers faced was conspiracy to impede federal employees from doing their jobs by threat, force or intimidation. 
‚ÄúI just sat through five weeks of a trial about threatening federal employees without hearing a single threat,‚Äù Schindler said in his closing argument. 
The defense tried to make its case bigger than the Bureau of Land Management and U.S. Fish and Wildlife employees in Harney County. 
Five defendants ended up taking the stand, speaking at length about the U.S. Constitution, land management, divinity, and the 2014 standoff in Bunkerville, Nevada. Ryan Bundy questioned his wife on the stand. David Fry giggled when prosecutors asked him about using government computers. Medenbach reveled in the glory of public testimony after decades of protesting the federal government. 
In their closing arguments, defense attorneys attempted to instill into the jurors a sense of political responsibility. 
‚ÄúWe‚Äôre counting on you to stop government overreach,‚Äù Marcus Mumford, Ammon Bundy‚Äôs attorney, told the jury. ‚ÄúOur trust is in you.‚Äù 
A jury found seven defendants charged in the occupation of the Malheur National Wildlife Refuge not guilty, following a trial that lasted several weeks. The Verdict 
Defense attorneys expressed shock at the verdict; even they did not expect such a result. It came despite scrutiny from U.S. District Court Judge Anna Brown and prosecutors for lack of organization . 
Defendants and their supporters erupted into tearful celebration outside the federal courthouse in downtown Portland (and streamed it live online, just like much of the occupation). 
‚ÄúWe came to Oregon ‚Äî to Harney County ‚Äî seeking justice,‚Äù defendant Neil Wampler said after his acquittal, ‚Äúand today we found it.‚Äù 
But despite defendants‚Äô and supporters‚Äô cries of victory, Juror No. 4 wrote in his letter to the Oregonian that the verdict was not an endorsement of the occupiers‚Äô political beliefs. 
‚ÄúIt should be known that all 12 jurors felt that this verdict was a statement regarding the various failures of the prosecution to prove ‚Äòconspiracy‚Äô in the count itself ‚Äî and not any form of affirmation of the defense‚Äôs various beliefs, actions or aspirations,‚Äù the juror wrote. 
Defendants and their supporters celebrated a not guilty verdict in the trial of seven people involved in the occupation of the Malheur National Wildlife Refuge. The Celebration 
The mood was jubilant among occupiers and their supporters, who grilled, milled and posed for cameras in downtown Portland on the Friday following the verdict. 
Many people have said they fear the verdict will embolden defendants and their supporters. Cox and Fry both said they would participate in protests like the Oregon Standoff again. 
‚ÄúIf I have a compelling urge to come out here to join a protest, if I think it‚Äôs a legitimate reason to come, I‚Äôll absolutely protest,‚Äù Fry told OPB. Teressa Raiford speaks at a Don‚Äôt Shoot PDX-organized rally on Portland State University‚Äôs campus. Bradley W. Parks/OPB 
The reaction was different just a few blocks away. 
Don‚Äôt Shoot PDX, a Portland activist group supportive of the Black Lives Matter movement, was holding what was supposed to be a rally, unrelated to the trial, at Portland State University. 
‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know how I can keep telling people to protest,‚Äù lead organizer Teressa Raiford told the crowd. Raiford seemed exhausted. 
The occupiers‚Äô acquittal came the same day more than 100 protesters in North Dakota were forcibly removed from the construction site of the Dakota Access Pipeline and arrested. It came weeks after Don‚Äôt Shoot PDX protesters were pushed out of City Hall and pepper-sprayed by Portland police. 
Raiford expressed anger at having to discuss the Malheur trial verdict. She and countless others on social media highlighted what many see as a double-standard in how law enforcement and the justice system punish people of color. With the exception of David Fry, defendants in the occupation case were all white. All jury members were also white. 
‚ÄúForty-one days at a compound on federal land,‚Äù Raiford said, pointing to weapons at the refuge, occupiers‚Äô refusal to leave, and threats made by occupiers against the FBI. 
‚ÄúThe difference is we would have been murdered,‚Äù Raiford said. 
Jarvis Kennedy, of the Burns, Oregon, Paiute tribe told OPB‚Äôs Amanda Peacher he was angry with the verdict. Kennedy and the Paiute tribe have been vocal opponents of the Malheur occupation from the start. However, Kennedy added he was now more motivated to fight for Native lands and rights . 
Don‚Äôt Shoot PDX eventually marched past the occupation supporters‚Äô barbecue Friday, where they staged a die-in near the courthouse steps and burned an American flag . 
After a brief shouting match, Bundy supporters went back to the grill and Don‚Äôt Shoot PDX continued to City Hall. A member of the Pacific Patriots Network at the Malheur National Wildlife Refuge in January. Many wonder if the verdict in the Oregon occupation trial will embolden militia groups to take up armed land battles throughout the West. Dave Blanchard/OPB The Implication 
Ammon and Ryan Bundy are still in federal custody, despite an animated effort by Marcus Mumford to win his client‚Äôs release upon receiving the verdict. 
After arguing with Judge Brown for Ammon Bundy to be let go, Mumford was tackled by U.S. Marshals, allegedly tased, briefly detained and later released. 
The Bundy brothers still face charges for the 2014 standoff in Bunkerville led by their father, Cliven Bundy. 
Seven Oregon occupiers still await trial in February, though the status of those proceedings could be in limbo. 
Shawna Cox called Thursday‚Äôs outcome ‚Äújust one win‚Äù in a larger movement to change how the federal government manages land in the American West. 
U.S. Attorney Billy Williams seemed to hope more people would shun the Bundys‚Äô form of protest. 
‚ÄúThere are a good number of folks in rural America who are of the mind that you don‚Äôt take arms and take over a federal facility to prove your point,‚Äù Williams said. 
The Oregon verdict will certainly color the conversation around the impending trial in Nevada. The result there ‚Äî where the penalties for alleged crimes are slightly more harsh than Oregon ‚Äî has the potential to make even bigger waves in the so-called patriot movement . 
But occupiers and their supporters cooking out in downtown Portland took heart in the Oregon verdict and envisioned a long fight ahead of them on behalf of rural Americans. 
Under downtown shade-trees, defendant Jeff Banta approached supporter David Zion Brugger, who decorated his hat and shirt with ‚ÄúNOT GUILTY‚Äù buttons, and shook his hand. 
In a hushed voice, Banta said, ‚ÄúSee you down the road.‚Äù Share On:",1
"Nuclear tensions between US, Russia reach ‚Äòdangerous‚Äô point","Nuclear tensions between US, Russia reach ‚Äòdangerous‚Äô point 10/31/2016 
PRESS TV 
US-Russian relations have slipped to their lowest point since the end of the Cold War, with tensions now spilling over to nuclear pacts and each side accusing the other of cheating, experts say. 
‚ÄúI would have to say that, without question, this is the low point in US-Russian relations since the end of the Cold War,‚Äù Steven Pifer, an arms control expert at the Brookings Institution, told NPR. 
The relationship took a turn for the worse two years ago with the conflict in Ukraine and slid lower last year with Russia‚Äôs air campaign in Syria, noted Pifer, a former US ambassador to Ukraine. 
This year, tensions have continued to mount with Russian and US aircraft buzzing each other over the Baltic and Washington accusing Moscow of trying to interfere in the US presidential elections, he added. 
Bickering over nuclear issues has also increased markedly in recent months. 
Early this month, Russia moved a battery of nuclear-capable missile launchers within range of three Baltic states, in what US officials said was a gesture to express displeasure with NATO. A Russian serviceman walks past Russian Iskander-M missile launchers before a rehearsal for the Victory Day parade, with the Moscow International Business Center also known as ‚ÄùMoskva-City‚Äù seen in the background, at a range in Moscow, Russia, May 5, 2016. (Photo by Reuters) 
In late October, Russia unveiled images of a new intercontinental ballistic missile dubbed the Satan 2, which, it says, can carry up to 15 separate warheads powerful enough to destroy an area the size of Texas. 
The US, in September, flew three long-range nuclear bombers over Eastern Europe to participate in NATO military exercises. 
These developments have worried nuclear arms experts. 
‚ÄúWe are in a dangerous situation,‚Äù Hans Kristensen, director of the Nuclear Information Project at the Federation of American Scientists, told NPR. ‚ÄúCertainly a situation that is much more dire or tense than it was 10 years ago.‚Äù 
In 1987, four years before the Soviet Union collapsed, Washington and Moscow signed a long-negotiated treaty ‚Äì known as the Intermediate Range Nuclear Forces Treaty ‚Äì to eliminate their arsenals of nuclear and conventional ground-launched ballistic and cruise missiles with ranges of 500 to 5,500 kilometers. 
‚ÄúSince May 2013, the Obama administration has repeatedly raised concerns with Russia regarding its lack of compliance with the INF Treaty,‚Äù a senior administration official told NPR on condition of anonymity. 
The official said Washington has called for a rare meeting of the treaty‚Äôs Special Verification Commission ‚Äúin the coming weeks‚Äù to try to resolve the matter. 
‚ÄúI actually think this is a good step,‚Äù Pifer said of the decision. 
The US claims that an intermediate-range missile being developed by Russia is not in line with the INF Treaty and wants clarification from Moscow. 
‚ÄúWhat the administration has said is that they provided enough information to the Russians so that the Russians could identify the missile in question. The Russians thus far have said no, they haven‚Äôt got enough information, so you‚Äôre in that kind of war of words,‚Äù Pifer added. President Putin speaks during a news conference. (File photo by AFP) 
The war of words further escalated in early October when Russian President Vladimir Putin announced the suspension of a Cold War deal with the US to dispose of weapons-grade plutonium. 
‚ÄúThat, I believe, was a little bit of a poke at President Obama, who attaches a lot of importance to the nuclear nonproliferation agenda,‚Äù Pifer said. 
Tensions are bound to mount even further over the next few months as the US and its NATO allies prepare to move thousands of troops as well as heavy military equipment to countries along and near Russia‚Äôs border, namely Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania. A US Army convoy rolls through Liepupe, Latvia, on its way from Estonia to Germany. (Photo by European Pressphoto Agency) 
‚ÄúThis is a gradual sort of escalation of tensions between the two sides that goes beyond discourse and just disagreements over a treaty,‚Äù Kristensen said. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs getting pretty deep now.‚Äù 
The rising tensions between the two nuclear powers have other experts worried. 
‚ÄúWe could head into a nuclear conflict which would devastate humanity,‚Äù American writer and retired professor James Petras told Press TV earlier this month. 
‚ÄúWe need to move away from this saber-rattling from Washington into a position that could come to terms with peaceful co-existence, but I don‚Äôt see that on the horizon in present or the near future with either Hillary Clinton or Donald Trump as presidential candidates,‚Äù he said.",1

"Joint Drills Between China, Saudis To ‚ÄòFight Terrorism‚Äô","Joint Drills Between China, Saudis To ‚ÄòFight Terrorism‚Äô 10/31/2016 
SPUTNIK NEWS 
China is improving its Special Forces combat capability to protect national interests abroad. Sputnik spoke with Russian experts about the first antiterrorist drills of the Special Forces of China and Saudi Arabia. 
The joint drills demonstrating combat skills and tactics took place for two weeks on the ground, in the vicinity of the Chinese city of Chungqing. 
The drills came to an end on Thursday and according to reports, 25 members of the Special Forces from each side took part in the exercises. Among the observers were Afghan military experts, who drew attention to the training that was focused on hostage rescue and improvement of overall combat training. 
Saudi Arabia is the first country in the Arab East with whom China has held bilateral military exercises. 
Expert from the Diplomatic Academy of China, Gao Fei, believes that it is natural for China and Saudi Arabia to have a partnership in this sphere. 
‚ÄúSaudi Arabia is a major regional power and the largest oil-producing country. It competes with Russia for the title of the world‚Äôs leading oil producer. In regard to oil reserves, it also holds the first place in the world,‚Äù Fei said. 
He further said that the country plays an important role in economics, politics and security in the whole region. In short, Saudi Arabia is an influential regional power. 
According to Fei, ‚ÄúLast month, China surpassed the US as world‚Äôs largest importer of oil. Cooperation between China and Saudi Arabia as an importer and supplier of oil shows mutual benefit and common interests.‚Äù 
In addition, China is already a major player in the international arena; its diplomacy has its own specifics. It not only gives meaning to its own interests, but also in international affairs takes the role of the responsible power. 
The expert further said that in the long term ‚Äúcooperation between China and Saudi Arabia will contribute to solving existing global problems, form a new world order, help search for consensus on specific issues and contribute to expansion joint interest.‚Äù 
The choice of Saudi Arabia as China‚Äôs partner to conduct anti-terrorist exercises is not surprising, according to an expert at the Russian Institute for Strategic Studies, Ajdar Kuratov. 
Kuratov said that Saudi Arabia is the main economic partner of China in the Middle East, a region where growth of China‚Äôs presence is particularly noticeable. 
China‚Äôs leadership is likely quite concerned with terrorism against the country and its citizens. Cases such as hostage taking on airplanes and other public places and attacks on public buildings are a big concern for the country.",1

‚ÄúChinese intelligence has repeatedly infiltrated US national security entities and extracted information with serious consequences for US national security, including information on the plans and operations of US military forces and the designs of US weapons and weapons systems,‚Äù a draft annual report for 2016 said, as cited by the Washington Free Beacon. 
The final version of the report of the US-China Economic and Security Review Commission is to be released November 16. 
The hacks allowed Beijing to gain ‚Äúinsight into the operation of US platforms and the operational approaches of US forces to potential contingencies in the region,‚Äù it goes on. 
According to the document, China applied efforts at ‚Äúcyber and human infiltration‚Äù of national security sectors, including the FBI and the US Pacific Command. The report says that Washington ‚Äúfaces a large and growing threat to its national security from Chinese intelligence collection operations.‚Äù 
Chinese spies reportedly hacked into secret US war plans, gaining information about nuclear weapons, and snooping into electrical power grids and financial networks. US Diplomatic, economic, and defense industrial sectors have also been the targets of China. 
‚ÄúUS critical infrastructure entities are a major target of Chinese cyber operations, and China is capable of significantly disrupting or damaging these entities,‚Äù the report said. 
The Chinese allegedly hacked into secret data of the MQ-9 Reaper drone, which has been a staple of US airstrikes in Iraq, Afghanistan and Pakistan over the past 9 years. 
US academics who work for the groups involved in China studies have also been reportedly targeted by Beijing. The document names an American student in China, Glenn Duffie Shriver, as a target. Shriver was convicted of conspiracy to spy for China in 2010. He was released in 2013. 
Obama administration officials have not escaped China‚Äôs alleged digital predation. 
‚ÄúAmong the information extracted were 5.6 million fingerprints, some of which could be used to identify undercover US government agents or to create duplicates of biometric data to obtain access to classified areas,‚Äù the report said. 
Several organizations allegedly contribute to China‚Äôs intelligence operations, including the Ministry of State Security (MSS), the People‚Äôs Liberation Army (PLA), and Communist Party military, as well as the PLA General Political Department and the Party‚Äôs United Front Work Department.",1

Could we see violence no matter who wins on November 8th? Let‚Äôs hope that it doesn‚Äôt happen, but as you will see below, anti-Trump violence is already sweeping the nation. If Trump were to actually win the election, that would likely send the radical left into a violent post-election temper tantrum unlike anything that we have ever seen before. Alternatively, there is a tremendous amount of concern on the right that this election could be stolen by Hillary Clinton. And as I showed yesterday, it appears that voting machines in Texas are already switching votes from Donald Trump to Hillary Clinton . If Hillary Clinton wins this election under suspicious circumstances, that also may be enough to set off widespread civil unrest all across the country. 
At this moment there is less than two weeks to go until November 8th, and a brand new survey has found that a majority of Americans are concerned ‚Äúabout the possibility of violence‚Äù on election day‚Ä¶ 
A 51% majority of likely voters express at least some concern about the possibility of violence on Election Day; one in five are ‚Äúvery concerned.‚Äù Three of four say they have confidence that the United States will have the peaceful transfer of power that has marked American democracy for more than 200 years, but just 40% say they are ‚Äúvery confident‚Äù about that. 
More than four in 10 of Trump supporters say they won‚Äôt recognize the legitimacy of Clinton as president, if she prevails, because they say she wouldn‚Äôt have won fair and square. 
But many on the left are not waiting until after the election to commit acts of violence. On Wednesday, Donald Trump‚Äôs star on the Walk of Fame was smashed into pieces by a man with a sledgehammer and a pick-ax‚Ä¶ 
Donald Trump took a lot of hits today, and not just in the Presidential race. With less than two weeks to go before America decides if the ex- Apprentice host will pull off a surprise victory over Hillary Clinton, Trump‚Äôs star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame was destroyed early Wednesday morning by a man dressed as a city construction worker and wielding a sledgehammer and pick-ax in what looks to be a Tinseltown first. 
And there were two other instances earlier this year when Donald Trump‚Äôs star was also vandalized. One came in January, and the other happened in June ‚Ä¶ 
This is of course not the first time the GOP candidate‚Äôs star has been attacked or defaced since Trump announced his White House bid in summer 2015. The most extreme measure was a reverse swastika being sprayed on the star at 6801 Hollywood Blvd in late January. In June this summer, a mute sign was painted on Trump‚Äôs star in a seemingly protest against the antagonistic language and policies some have accused Trump of promoting and reveling in during the campaign. In both cases, Trump‚Äôs star was quickly cleaned and back as new within a day. 
We have seen anti-Trump violence on the east coast as well. Earlier this month, someone decided to firebomb the Republican Party headquarters in Orange County, North Carolina. On the building next to the headquarters, someone spray-painted ‚ÄúNazi Republicans get out of town or else‚Äù along with a swastika. 
There have also been other disturbing incidents of anti-Trump violence all over the nation in recent days. A recent Lifezette article put together quite a long list, and the following is just a short excerpt from that piece‚Ä¶ 
On Oct. 15 in Bangor, Maine, vandals spray-painted about 20 parked cars outside a Trump rally. Trump supporter Paul Foster, whose van was hit with white paint, told reporters, ‚ÄúWhy can‚Äôt they do a peaceful protest instead of painting cars, all of this, to make their statement?‚Äù 
Around Oct. 3, a couple of Trump supporters were assaulted in Zeitgeist, a San Francisco bar, after they were allegedly refused service for expressing support for Trump, GotNews reports. ‚ÄúThe two Trump supporters were attacked, punched, and chased into the street by ‚Äòsome thugs‚Äô that a barmaid called out from the back.‚Äù Lilian Kim of ABC 7 Bay Area tweeted a photo of the men, in which one was wearing a Trump T-shirt and the other was wearing a ‚ÄúBlue Lives Matter‚Äù shirt. 
On Sept. 28 in El Cajon, California, an angry mob at a Black Lives Matter protest beat 21-year-old Trump supporter Feras Jabro for wearing a ‚ÄúMake America Great Again‚Äù baseball cap. The assault was broadcast live using the smartphone app Periscope. 
There is a move to get Trump supporters to wear red on election day, but in many parts of America that might just turn his supporters into easy targets. Let‚Äôs certainly hope that we don‚Äôt see the kind of violent confrontations at voting locations that many experts are anticipating. 
Of course there are also many on the right that are fighting mad, and a Hillary Clinton victory under suspicious circumstances may be enough to push them over the edge. 
For example, this week former Congressman Joe Walsh said that he is ‚Äúgrabbing my musket‚Äù if Donald Trump loses the election‚Ä¶ 
Former Rep. Joe Walsh appeared to call for armed revolution Wednesday if Donald Trump is not elected president. 
Walsh, a former tea party congressman from Illinois who is now a conservative talk radio host, tweeted, ‚ÄúOn November 8th, I‚Äôm voting for Trump. On November 9th, if Trump loses, I‚Äôm grabbing my musket. You in?‚Äù 
And without a doubt, many ordinary Americans are stocking up on guns and ammunition just in case Hillary Clinton is victorious. The following comes from USA Today ‚Ä¶ 
‚ÄúSince the polls are starting to shift quite a bit towards Hillary Clinton, I‚Äôve been buying a lot more ammunition,‚Äù says Rick Darling, 69, an engineer from Harrison Township, in Michigan‚Äôs Detroit suburbs. In a follow-up phone interview after being surveyed, the Trump supporter said he fears progressives will want to ‚Äúdeclare martial law and take our guns away‚Äù after the election. 
Today America is more divided than I have ever seen it before, and the mainstream media is constantly fueling the hatred and the anger that various groups feel toward one another. 
Ironically, Donald Trump has been working very hard to bring America together. In fact, he is solidly on track to win a higher percentage of the black vote than any Republican presidential candidate since 1960 . 
If Hillary Clinton and the Democrats win on November 8th, things will not go well for Hillary Clinton‚Äôs political enemies. The Clintons used the power of the White House to go after their enemies the first time around, and Hillary is even more angry and more bitter now than she was back then. 
And the radical left is very clear about who their enemies are. This is something that I discussed on national television earlier this month ‚Ä¶ 
As I write this, it is difficult for me to even imagine how horrible a Hillary Clinton presidency would be. 
But at this point that appears to be the most likely outcome . 
Out of all the candidates that we could have chosen, the American people are about to put the most evil one by far into the White House. 
Perhaps Donald Trump can still pull off a miracle and we can avoid that fate, but time is rapidly slipping away and November 8th will be here before we know it. Share On:",1
Genetically Modified Crops in U.S. Fail to Deliver Expected Yields,"Genetically Modified Crops in U.S. Fail to Deliver Expected Yields 10/31/2016 
ALL GOV 
The controversy over genetically modified crops has long focused on largely unsubstantiated fears that they are unsafe to eat. 
But an extensive examination by The New York Times indicates that the debate has missed a more basic problem ‚Äî genetic modification in the United States and Canada has not accelerated increases in crop yields or led to an overall reduction in the use of chemical pesticides. 
The promise of genetic modification was twofold: By making crops immune to the effects of weedkillers and inherently resistant to many pests, they would grow so robustly that they would become indispensable to feeding the world‚Äôs growing population, while also requiring fewer applications of sprayed pesticides. 
Twenty years ago, Europe largely rejected genetic modification at the same time the United States and Canada were embracing it. Comparing results on the two continents, using independent data as well as academic and industry research, shows how the technology has fallen short of the promise. 
An analysis by The Times using U.N. data showed that the United States and Canada have gained no discernible advantage in yields when measured against Western Europe, a region with comparably modernized agricultural producers like France and Germany . Also, a recent National Academy of Sciences report found ‚Äúthere was little evidence‚Äù that the introduction of genetically modified crops in the United States had led to yield gains beyond those seen in conventional crops. 
At the same time, herbicide use has increased in the United States, even as major crops like corn, soybeans and cotton have been converted to modified varieties. And the United States has fallen behind Europe‚Äôs biggest producer, France, in reducing the overall use of pesticides, which includes both herbicides and insecticides. 
One measure, contained in data from the U.S. Geological Survey , shows the stark difference in the use of pesticides. Since GM crops were introduced in the United States two decades ago for crops like corn, cotton and soybeans, the use of toxins that kill insects and fungi has fallen by a third, but the spraying of herbicides, which are used in much higher volumes, has risen 21 percent. 
By contrast, in France, use of insecticides and fungicides has fallen 65 percent and herbicide use has decreased 36 percent.

It has been a devastating period for the Hillary Clinton campaign. First, the FBI re-opened the investigation into her e-mail scandal and now, Julian Assange has promised that what‚Äôs in the next batch of e-mails to be published to Wikileaks will lead to her arrest. 
Since the first week of October, there have been 21 batches released totaling 35,594 e-mails. According to a message on Twitter, there are more than 50,000 remaining. 
In a broadcast for Russia Today, a London reporter said, ‚ÄúAssange will be releasing more material in what he says will provide enough evidence to see Hillary Clinton arrested.‚Äù 
These will be the nail in Hillary Clinton‚Äôs coffin, she added. 
Assange assured Russia has no involvement in his e-mail hacking like Democrats are claiming. The DNC servers, he said, were ‚Äúripe for hacking‚Äù and ‚Äúriddled with holes.‚Äù

Army says 2-star general committed suicide,"Army says 2-star general committed suicide 10/31/2016 
MSN 
The Army said Friday it has determined that suicide was the cause of death of a two-star general who was found dead in his home on a military base in Alabama. 
Maj. Gen. John Rossi was found dead July 31 at Redstone Arsenal, two days before he was to assume command of Army Space and Missile Defense Command. 
He is the first Army general to commit suicide on active duty since record-keeping began in 2000, according to the Army. Military suicides soared earlier this decade and remain a major source of concern; they typically have affected lower-ranking military members. 
Rossi, a West Point academy graduate and an air defense artillery officer by training, had just moved onto Redstone Arsenal and was scheduled to be promoted to lieutenant general when he took command of Space and Missile Defense Command. 
A written statement by the Army on Friday made no mention of what might have prompted Rossi to take his own life. 
The Rossi family issued a statement through the Army expressing thanks for wide support and urging those who may need suicide-prevention help to seek it immediately. 
‚ÄúTo the Army, he was Maj. Gen. Rossi,‚Äù it said. ‚ÄúTo us, he was John ‚Äî husband, dad.‚Äù 
‚ÄúWe ask for the time and space to grieve in private, and for the Army to continue to better understand suicide, and to help and treat those in need,‚Äù the family statement added. ‚ÄúFor our family, this has been an incredibly painful time, and we ask that you continue to keep us in your thoughts and prayers. To all the other families out there, to the man or woman who may be facing challenging times, please seek assistance immediately. Compassionate and confidential assistance is available.‚Äù",1
Hillary Reboots ‚ÄòVast Right-Wing Conspiracy‚Äô Playbook,"Hillary Reboots ‚ÄòVast Right-Wing Conspiracy‚Äô Playbook 10/31/2016 
LIFEZETTE 
Before even 24 hours had passed since the FBI director informed Congress on Friday that it was reopening the probe into Hillary Clinton‚Äôs emails, Clinton suggested the director was in cahoots with the Republican Party. 
‚ÄúWe‚Äôve made it very clear that, if they are going to be sending this kind of letter that is only going originally to Republican members of the House, that they need to share whatever facts they claim to have with the American people,‚Äù Clinton said on Friday, after initially being blindsided by the FBI‚Äôs announcement. 
The claim wasn‚Äôt true. All you had to do is turn the page and find Democratic members of Congress who had also received the letter from the FBI. But it shows how ready Clinton is to fight anyone in the government who dares investigate or question her. It is likely a habit Clinton picked up when she was first lady, from 1993 to 2001. 
Clinton‚Äôs opening salvo, though weak, is a sign of more to come. Her coming attack on the FBI and its director, James Comey, will likely begin in earnest on Monday, with her operatives using the letter to Congress as proof Clinton is the victim of a political conspiracy. 
Clinton previewed her attack in Daytona Beach, Florida, on Saturday, when she said the letter was ‚Äúunprecedented and deeply troubling.‚Äù 
Clinton will also turn the issue into one of ‚Äútransparency‚Äù ‚Äî even though FBI investigations are inherently not transparent. In Daytona, she called on Comey to ‚Äúexplain everything right away, put it all right on the table‚Äù ‚Äî a demand she knows will go unheeded. 
But many of Clinton‚Äôs allies in the media are likely to demand to see the emails found on former Rep. Anthony Weiner‚Äôs laptop. 
It‚Äôs a strategy that could work, even with only a few days left until Election Day. 
Such attacks on law enforcement worked fairly well for Clinton in 1998, when she and her husband, then-President Bill Clinton, vilified independent counsel Kenneth Starr. Starr had been tasked by Bill Clinton‚Äôs own attorney general to investigate corruption charges, but likely rued the day he ever took the job. 
In 1994, Bill Clinton faced questions from many, including The New York Times, about an investment the Clintons made in a company called Whitewater Development Corp. Bill Clinton‚Äôs attorney general, Janet Reno, made Robert Fiske the independent counsel. 
Fiske would later be replaced by Starr. Starr‚Äôs investigation would later reach into charges that President Clinton had lied in the Paula Jones sexual harassment civil trial. With explosive charges being published by the Drudge Report and Newsweek in January 1998 that Bill Clinton had seduced an intern, Monica Lewinsky, the Clintons could have been expected to admit the truth and take the punishments. 
Instead, the Clinton White House and the Democrats began attacking Starr and the Republicans. 
On Jan. 27, 1998, Hillary Clinton went on NBC‚Äôs ‚ÄúThe Today Show‚Äù and goaded the press into covering the opposition rather than President Bill Clinton, who had lied about his affair with Lewinsky just one day earlier. 
Matt Lauer asked if Hillary Clinton had said the fight against Starr would be the ‚Äúlast great battle‚Äù of the Clinton White House. 
‚ÄúWell, I don‚Äôt know if I‚Äôve been that dramatic,‚Äù Hillary Clinton replied. ‚ÄúBut I do believe that this is a battle. I mean, look at the very people who are involved in this ‚Äî they have popped up in other settings. This is ‚Äî the great story here for anybody willing to find it and write about it and explain it is this vast right-wing conspiracy that has been conspiring against my husband since the day he announced for president.‚Äù 
The Starr report on the Clinton scandals was released months later. But what the Clintons are really proud of that is that the Democrats actually gained seats in the 1998 midterm elections, helping to cause a backfire against the GOP. 
The GOP didn‚Äôt have anywhere near the two-thirds majority in the Senate to remove Bill Clinton. In early 1999, the U.S. Senate acquitted Bill Clinton on two charges: obstruction of justice, and perjury. 
It taught the Clintons the wrong lesson: to fight authorities if authorities questioned them ‚Äî even authorities within the Democratic Party. Clinton will be targeting and attacking President Obama‚Äôs own FBI director as Obama leaves office.",1
Here is Elon Musk‚Äôs True Mars On Earth Plan,"Here is Elon Musk‚Äôs True Mars On Earth Plan 11/01/2016 
GAME N GUIDE 
Elon Musk, the founder of SpaceX recently held a Reddit Ask Me Anything session at 6:00 p.m. ET on Oct. 23. The session was said to be a follow-up to the executive‚Äôs speech in Mexico last month. Musk unveiled his plans for a refueling site and eventually habitation in the methane-rich planet. SpaceX is said to have raised more questions lately than it has revealed. The inventor and conglomerate went to Twitter to announce the session, Engadget reported. For instance, the company‚Äôs plan on colonizing Mars is yet to be discussed as well as the reliability of its space rockets and how it can be improved. In addition, the company also previously revealed that it would be reusing their rockets but have kept mum on how. Previously, Musk had a speech at the International Astronautical Congress in Guadalajara, Mexico in September. In the said Congress, Musk revealed his plans of sending humans to Mars apparently costing a whooping $10 billion each. Moreover he stated that humans will be turned into a multi-planetary species within the span of 40 years to a century. Musk revealed his vision with massive reusable rockets launching into a parking orbit stating that the rockets may be refueled by propellant tankers. Additionally, Musk plans to launch a thousand spaceships with a hundred people each en masse for Mars. He further revealed that a refueling station would be placed on the red planet to harvest methane fuel so settlers may come back to Earth. Hence, the first rocket to be sent is the Dragon spacecraft to search for a site to plant the refueling station followed by a spaceship with equipment to build the refueling station, LA Times reported. Musk went on to describe his ideal vision for human habitation on Mars. Musk revealed that glass panels with carbon fiber frames would be brought to the red planet to build geodesic domes on the planet‚Äôs surface. Furthermore, several miner and tunneling droids would also be sent to Mars. The droids are expected to be used to build large quantities of pressurized space for industrial operations along with glass domes for green living.

Asteroid Warning System Found ‚ÄòCity-Killer‚Äô Object Heading Toward Earth,"Asteroid Warning System Found ‚ÄòCity-Killer‚Äô Object Heading Toward Earth 11/01/2016 
DAILY CALLER 
NASA‚Äôs new asteroid warning system detected a large ‚Äúcity-killer‚Äù asteroid hurtling toward Earth less than a week before it narrowly missed. 
The rock, officially named 2016 UR36, was first detected Oct. 25 by a telescope in Hawaii and passed by Earth five days later. The asteroid missed by a distance of only 310,000 miles, around 1.3 times further away than the Moon. That‚Äôs incredibly close in space terms. 
2016 UR36 could be up to 82 feet across, roughly comparable in size to the meteor that exploded over Russia in February 2013, causing hundreds of injuries . 
If 2016 UR36 had slammed into Earth, it would have struck with a force 55 times stronger than the atomic bomb that destroyed Hiroshima near the end of World War II. That‚Äôs more than enough force to level a city. 
NASA director Charles Bolden told reporters in 2013 that the only response to a such a late detection of an asteroid set to collide with Earth was to ‚Äú Pray .‚Äù 
Global asteroid detection programs found more than 15,176 near-Earth objects of all sizes with 1,562 new near-Earth objects being identified this year alone, according to International Astronomical Union‚Äôs Minor Planets Center . These newly discovered near-Earth objects are part of a much larger population of more than 700,000 known asteroids in our Solar System. 
NASA and its European partners are now focused on finding objects that are 450 feet in diameter or larger, which could devastate a city or country if they struck Earth. 
In the event an asteroid couldn‚Äôt be prevented from hitting Earth, the Planetary Defense Coordination Office would work with Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), the Department of Defense, and other federal agencies to coordinate disaster response.",1
Oregon Standoff Acquittal Sparks Fears of New Land Disputes,"Oregon Standoff Acquittal Sparks Fears of New Land Disputes 11/01/2016 
AGWEB 
The stunning acquittal of seven people who occupied a federal wildlife sanctuary in Oregon during an armed standoff raised fears Friday that the verdict could embolden other militant groups in a long-running dispute over government-owned Western lands. 
Meanwhile, a juror said the decision was a rejection of the prosecution‚Äôs conspiracy case, not an endorsement of the defendants‚Äô actions. 
Supporters of Ammon Bundy celebrated the verdict and said it could invite more confrontations. The government‚Äôs top federal land official, Interior Secretary Sally Jewell, issued a statement urging all employees to ‚Äúremain vigilant and report any suspicious activity.‚Äù 
An activist from Boise, Idaho, who once camped by a memorial to occupier LaVoy Finicum at the site where he was shot dead by police, predicted that the verdict would encourage others to act. 
‚ÄúI think a lot more people will be revolting, rebelling and standing up against what we see as a tyrannical government,‚Äù William C. Fisher said in a telephone interview. 
The 41-day takeover of the Malheur National Wildlife Refuge last January in remote eastern Oregon was part of a larger debate about the use of federal lands in the West. The militants led by Bundy, a small business owner from Arizona, wanted to hand the refuge over to local officials, saying the federal government should not have dominion over it. 
The U.S. government owns nearly half of all land in the West, compared with only 4 percent in other states, according to the Congressional Overview of Federal Land Ownership. 
One of the jurors in the case asserted Friday that the panel was not endorsing militancy to resolve those issues. 
The juror, identified only as Juror No. 4, wrote in an email to The Oregonian/OregonLive that the verdicts were a ‚Äústatement‚Äù about the prosecution‚Äôs failure to prove a conspiracy charge ‚Äúand not any form of affirmation of the defense‚Äôs various beliefs, actions or aspirations.‚Äù 
The acquittal of the white occupiers came on the same day that officers in riot gear evicted protesters from private land in the path of the Dakota Access oil pipeline in rural North Dakota. Officers fired bean bags and pepper spray as they surrounded demonstrators, many of them Native Americans who have spent months fighting over tribal rights and the project‚Äôs environmental effects. At least 117 people were arrested. 
‚ÄúAre we going to look at these protests the same way?‚Äù asked John Freemuth, a public land policy expert at Boise State University. ‚ÄúI certainly think the tribes will have a point if they find themselves arrested and in jail and these Oregon guys get off.‚Äù 
Bundy, his brother Ryan Bundy and five others were charged with conspiring to impede federal workers from their jobs at the refuge. 
Chris Rasmussen, a defense lawyer in an armed standoff case that happened two years ago at Bundy‚Äôs father‚Äôs ranch in Nevada, said it is ‚Äúobvious‚Äù that Oregon prosecutors gambled in seeking convictions on felony conspiracy charges instead of misdemeanor trespassing charges. 
But prosecutors had few other options for serious charges because the defendants never attacked anyone, said Laurie Levenson, a professor at Loyola Law School in Los Angeles and a former federal prosecutor. 
Rather than attempting to retake the refuge headquarters and risking a gunbattle, authorities took a cautious approach. They closed nearby roads and stayed miles away while urging the occupiers to abandon the land. 
‚ÄúThe upside of not confronting them was it was less likely there would be violence,‚Äù Levenson said. ‚ÄúThe downside was it was less likely that they could use the assault charge.‚Äù 
The standoff finally ended when the Bundys and other key figures were arrested in a Jan. 26 traffic stop outside the refuge. That‚Äôs when Finicum was killed. Most occupiers left after his death, but four holdouts remained until Feb. 11, when they surrendered following lengthy negotiations. 
Bundy remains in jail because he still faces charges in the standoff at his father‚Äôs Nevada ranch. 
Joel Hansen, Cliven Bundy‚Äôs attorney, said Friday that he thinks the jury in Oregon ‚Äúsaw through the lies‚Äù of a government that ‚Äúis trying to prove these Bundybrothers and their compatriots were some kind of terrorists.‚Äù 
For Hansen and some others in the rural West, ownership of public land is a constitutional question that has not been settled. 
‚ÄúThere is a seething anger among those who use the land,‚Äù he said, citing the feelings of ranchers, loggers, miners and Indians. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs all part of tyrannical oppression. Their goal is to manage them out of business to get them off the land.‚Äù 
The Oregon occupiers had chosen, perhaps inadvertently, a part of Oregon where locals and the feds had a recent history of working together. Few who live near the sanctuary welcomed the occupiers, most of whom were from out of state. 
Not long before the takeover began on Jan. 2, locals and federal officials had determined the fate of large swaths of land, Harney County Judge Steve Grasty, the top local administrative official, said last summer in an interview. 
The High Desert Partnership in Harney County, a group that includes the Bureau of Land Management, the Nature Conservancy and timber business owners, had been working quietly to determine land stewardship, which Jewell credited in her statement on Friday.",1
"Ron Paul: Blame Government, Not Markets For Monopoly","Ron Paul: Blame Government, Not Markets For Monopoly 11/01/2016 
EURASIA REVIEW 
When Time-Warner announced it planned to merge with another major communications firm, many feared the new company would exercise near-total monopoly power. These concerns led some to call for government action to block the merger in order to protect both Time-Warner‚Äôs competitors and consumers. 
No, I am not talking about Time-Warner‚Äôs recent announced plan to merge with AT&T, but the reaction to Time-Warner‚Äôs merger with (then) Internet giant AOL in 2000. Far from creating an untouchable leviathan crushing all competitors, the AOL-Time-Warner merger fell apart in under a decade. 
The failure of AOL-Time-Warner demonstrates that even the biggest companies are vulnerable to competition if there is open entry into the marketplace. AOL-Time-Warner failed because consumers left them for competitors offering lower prices and/or better quality. 
Corporate mergers and ‚Äúhostile‚Äù takeovers can promote economic efficiency by removing inefficient management and boards of directors. These managers and board members often work together to promote their own interests instead of generating maximum returns for investors by providing consumers with affordable, quality products. Thus, laws making it difficult to launch a ‚Äúhostile‚Äù takeover promote inefficient use of resources and harm investors, workers, and consumers. 
Monopolies and cartels are creations of government, not markets. For example, the reason the media is dominated by a few large companies is that no one can operate a television or radio station unless they obtain federal approval and pay federal licensing fees. Similarly, anyone wishing to operate a cable company must not only comply with federal regulations, they must sign a ‚Äúfranchise‚Äù agreement with their local government. Fortunately, the Internet has given Americans greater access to news and ideas shut out by the government-licensed lapdogs of the ‚Äúmainstream‚Äù media. This may be why so many politicians are anxious to regulate the web. 
Government taxes and regulations are effective means of limiting competition in an industry. Large companies can afford the costs of complying with government regulations, costs which cripple their smaller competitors. Big business can also afford to hire lobbyists to ensure that new laws and regulations favor big business. 
Examples of regulations that benefit large corporations include the Food and Drug Administration‚Äôs (FDA) regulations that raise costs of developing a new drug, as well as limit consumers ability to learn about natural alternatives to pharmaceuticals. Another example is the Dodd-Frank legislation, which has strengthened large financial intuitions while harming their weaker competitors. 
Legislation forcing consumers to pay out-of-state sales tax on their online purchases is a classic case of business seeking to use government to harm less politically-powerful competitors. This legislation is being pushed by large brick-and-mortar stores and Internet retailers who are seeking a government-granted advantage over smaller competitors. 
Many failed mergers and acquisitions result from the distorted signals sent to business and investors by the Federal Reserve‚Äôs inflationary monetary policy. Perhaps the most famous example of this is the AOL-Time-Warner fiasco, which was a direct result of the Fed-created dot.com bubble. 
In a free market, mergers between businesses enable consumers to benefit from new products and reduced prices. Any businesses that charge high prices or offer substandard products will soon face competition from businesses offering consumers lower prices and/or higher quality. Monopolies only exist when government tilts the playing field in favor of well-connected crony capitalists. Therefore those concerned about excessive corporate power should join supporters of the free market in repudiating the regulations, taxes, and subsides that benefit politically-powerful businesses. The most important step is to end the boom-bust business cycle by ending the Federal Reserve.

DOJ Tried Repeatedly To Kill FBI‚Äôs Clinton Foundation Investigation,"DOJ Tried Repeatedly To Kill FBI‚Äôs Clinton Foundation Investigation 11/01/2016 
THE DAILY CALLER 
Senior-level Justice Department officials pushed back heavily on an ongoing FBI investigation of the Clinton Foundation, according to a bombshell report from The Wall Street Journal. 
The newspaper laid out numerous examples, based on law enforcement sources, of senior DOJ officials intervening to quash the probe. 
Prosecutors with the U.S. attorneys office in the Eastern District of New York ‚Äî which Loretta Lynch led before taking over as attorney general last year ‚Äî refused to allow FBI investigators probing the Clinton family charity to review emails found on devices turned over this year by two of Clinton‚Äôs lawyers during the separate investigation into the mishandling of classified information on Clinton‚Äôs private email system. 
The rationale, according to The Journal , was that the devices were covered by partial immunity and limited-use agreements that the Clinton lawyers ‚Äî Cheryl Mills and Heather Samuelson ‚Äî agreed to with the DOJ. Information recovered from the laptops could only be used in the email investigation and not in others. 
As part of the immunity agreement, the FBI and Justice Department agreed to destroy Mills‚Äô and Samuelson‚Äôs devices, a revelation that sparked outrage from congressional Republicans when it was announced earlier this month. 
The Journal‚Äôs report largely confirms reporting in August from The Daily Caller News Foundation‚Äôs Richard Pollock that the FBI and several U.S. attorneys offices were conducting an unorthodox, joint investigation into the Clinton Foundation.

CNN reported at around the same time that a Clinton Foundation probe was tabled by the Justice Department. Pollock‚Äôs report and the new piece from The Journal undermine CNN‚Äôs reporting. 
While the investigation has gone forward, the Justice Department has stymied the investigation at several turns, according to The Journal. 
The DOJ refused to grant the FBI the power to issue subpoenas or conduct formal interviews. It also refused to convene a grand jury to weigh evidence in the case. 
More pushback occurred in August, when a senior DOJ official contacted the FBI‚Äôs deputy director, Andrew McCabe, to voice his displeasure that New York field office agents were continuing the investigation even though the DOJ had declined to provide investigative support. 
The official was ‚Äúvery pissed off‚Äù that the FBI was continuing its efforts, according to The Journal. 
The call occurred on Aug. 12, a day after CNN reported details of FBI-DOJ discord over whether to investigate the Clinton Foundation. It was also a day after Pollock reported that an investigation was underway. 
McCabe figures prominently in The Journal‚Äôs reporting and in the overlapping Clintonworld investigations. 
It was revealed last week that McCabe‚Äôs wife, Jill, received nearly $470,000 in contributions to a Virginia state senate campaign last year from Gov. Terry McAuliffe‚Äôs super PAC. 
McAuliffe is a close Clinton ally and is the subject of a separate FBI investigation. 
According to The Journal, McCabe refocused the Clinton Foundation investigation a week after FBI director James Comey announced in early July that he would recommend to the Justice Department that charges not be filed against Clinton for mishandling classified information in her emails. 
The charity probe would be led by the FBI‚Äôs New York office with help from the Little Rock office, according to The Journal. FBI field offices in Los Angeles and Washington were also involved in the Clinton Foundation investigation. 
The Los Angeles office subpoenaed bank records related to the Clinton Foundation after obtaining information during a separate public corruption case. The office in Washington was investigating McAuliffe‚Äôs financial relationships from before he joined the Clinton Foundation as a board member. 
After Comey‚Äôs announcement on the Clinton email investigation in July, McCabe decided that the Washington FBI office would focus on the separate McAuliffe matter. He recused himself from that investigation because of the donations his wife received from McAuliffe‚Äôs super PAC in 2015. 
While the FBI has insisted that McCabe is not compromised in any of the investigations ‚Äî the email probe, the Clinton Foundation, or the McAuliffe matter ‚Äî The Journal reports that some agents believe he has issued ‚Äústand down‚Äù orders in the Clinton Foundation inquiry. U.S. Attorney General Loretta Lynch looks on after announcing federal action related to North Carolina, at the U.S. Department of Justice (Getty Images) 
That claim came from FBI agents lower on the chain of command from senior-level officials. Still other sources denied that McCabe issued a ‚Äústand down‚Äù order. They asserted that McCabe ordered investigators to continue on their investigative path. 
McCabe‚Äôs Aug. 12 phone conversation with the senior DOJ official would seem to suggest that he supported the investigation. 
‚ÄúAre you telling me that I need to shut down a validly predicated investigation?‚Äù McCabe asked the DOJ official, according to a Journal source who was familiar with the conversation. 
‚ÄúOf course not,‚Äù the official reportedly said, after a brief pause. 
The new report also details a presentation that FBI officials made to the Justice Department in February to lay out the case against the Clinton Foundation. 
Some of the Journal‚Äôs sources said that the DOJ‚Äôs career public integrity prosecutors did not believe that the case was strong. 
‚ÄúOthers said that from the start, the Justice Department officials were stern, icy and dismissive of the case,‚Äù The Journal reported. 
DOJ officials told the FBI at the meeting additional investigative tools ‚Äî subpoenas, interviews or a grand jury ‚Äî would not be authorized.",1
Dakota Access Pipeline: More Than 100 Arrested as Protesters Ousted From Camp,"Dakota Access Pipeline: More Than 100 Arrested as Protesters Ousted From Camp 11/01/2016 
NBC NEWS 
Authorities used pepper spray and fired bean bags at activists demonstrating against a controversial North Dakota oil pipeline as the standoff there reached a new peak Thursday, according to officials. 
Armed soldiers and police in riot gear removed the demonstrators using trucks, military Humvees, and buses Thursday afternoon, according to The Associated Press. Two helicopters and an airplane scanned the operation from the air. 
At least 141 protesters were arrested as of midnight Thursday (1 a.m. ET) after law enforcement slowly closed in and tensions escalated, the Morton County Sheriff‚Äôs Department said in a statement. 
Seven protesters used ‚Äúsleeping dragon‚Äù devices, which typically involve PVC or other pipe, to attach themselves to items, and fires were set on a highway and improvised fire bombs were thrown at law enforcement, the Morton County Sheriff‚Äôs Department said in a statement. 
One woman allegedly fired three shots from a revolver at police, an emergency services official said. No one was hit. 
The chairman of the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe criticized law enforcement‚Äôs ‚Äúmilitarized‚Äù response to the camp and called for demonstrations to remain peaceful, but stressed that activists would not give up their cause. 
‚ÄúMilitarized law enforcement agencies moved in on water protectors with tanks and riot gear today. We continue to pray for peace,‚Äù Dave Archambault II said in a statement Thursday evening. 
‚ÄúWe won‚Äôt step down from this fight,‚Äù he added. ‚ÄúAs peoples of this earth, we all need water. This is about our water, our rights, and our dignity as human beings.‚Äù 
Archambault also called on activists to ‚Äúremain in peace and prayer.‚Äù‚ÄúAny act of violence hurts our case and is not welcome here,‚Äù he said. 
Law enforcement were holding a line north of the Backwater Bridge early Friday morning, the sheriff‚Äôs department. 
A woman who was being arrested pulled a .38 caliber revolver and fired three shots at law enforcement, ‚Äúnarrowly missing a sheriff‚Äôs deputy,‚Äù North Dakota State Emergency Services Spokeswoman Cecily Fong told NBC News. The woman was taken into custody and no shots were fired by law enforcement, she said. 
The protesters were ousted from the camp that authorities said was on private property in the path of the pipeline late Thursday afternoon, Morton County Sheriff Kyle Kirchmeier told the AP. 
The sheriff said that while the camp was secure, officers were still dealing with protesters in the surrounding area, according to the AP. Kirchmeier added that authorities would maintain a presence in the area for the time being to keep protesters off the land. Fong confirmed to NBC News that the camp was cleared. 
Protesters allegedly started two fires on the Backwater Bridge protest site and threw Molotov cocktails at law enforcement Thursday night, Fong said. 
About 250 protesters had gathered at the camp and another 80 demonstrators with a dozen horses were at the site of a county road, according to a statement from the Morton County Sheriff‚Äôs Department. 
Protesters on horseback galloped toward the law enforcement line before wheeling around and some had begun throwing objects at the officers, Fong said. Demonstrators also allegedly set four DAPL construction vehicles ablaze, Fong said Thursday evening. 
‚ÄúThey‚Äôve definitely escalated, they‚Äôre throwing rocks and debris,‚Äù she said. A handful of officers suffered minor injuries, she said. 
Officers fired bean bag rounds and used pepper spray on protesters, Fong said. 
Authorities also used a long-range acoustic device with a high-pitched tone to disperse the protesters, who set tires on fire on the highway Thursday afternoon, according to a post on the Morton County Sheriff‚Äôs Department Facebook page . Demonstrators stand next to burning tires as armed soldiers and law enforcement officers assemble on Oct. 27, 2016, to force Dakota Access pipeline protesters off private land where they had camped to block construction.

The department said they repeatedly told the demonstrators they were ‚Äúfree to go,‚Äù asking them to move to a separate camp further south and let authorities put out the flames. 
The protesters also set an area on fire near a bridge on a county road, according to a statement from the sheriff‚Äôs department. 
The protesters, comprised of a group that includes Native Americans and environmental activists, had been camped on private property since Sunday near the $3.8 billion Dakota Access Pipeline, near the town of Cannon Ball. 
The 1,172-mile pipeline would run within a half-mile of the Standing Rock Sioux reservation. Opponents of the project say the pipeline could adversely impact drinking water and would disturb sacred burial sites. 
Hundreds of protesters from Standing Rock and other tribes have set up camp for months in protest a few miles away from where Thursday‚Äôs confrontation occurred, close to where the Missouri and Cannonball rivers meet. 
Thursday‚Äôs incident came less than a week after more than 80 people were arrested and authorities used pepper spray on demonstrators. The arrests came during a five-hour conflict with police and around 300 protesters, some of whom stubbornly parked cars on the highway near the camp to block authorities from reaching them, according to the AP. They also set a small fire at one of two blockades they set up on the highway. 
The majority of the protesters were retreating from the area of confrontation on the highway outside the camp, but had not fully left the area of private land, according to the AP. About 200 protesters remained in the area, listening to tribal elders speak and praying as authorities continued to approach. Play

Law enforcement officials began taking steps to remove roadblocks and protesters of the Dakota Access Pipeline near Highway 1806 at around 11:15 a.m. local time (12:15 p.m. ET), Kirchmeier said in a statement. 
‚ÄúProtesters‚Äô escalated unlawful behavior this weekend by setting up illegal roadblocks, trespassing onto private property and establishing an encampment, has forced law enforcement to respond at this time,‚Äù he said in the statement. 
‚ÄúI can‚Äôt stress it enough, this is a public safety issue,‚Äù the sheriff said. ‚ÄúWe cannot have protesters blocking county roads, blocking state highways, or trespassing on private property.‚Äù 
The protesters had created a camp in the pipeline‚Äôs path on private property known as the Cannonball Ranch on the side of the highway and set up the roadblocks along on Sunday, according to the statement. 
Highway 1806 remained closed Thursday between Fort Rice and Cannonball, according to the sheriff department‚Äôs statement. Various counties, cities, state agencies and out-of-state law enforcement were helping the Morton County Sheriff‚Äôs Department, the statement said. 
Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton‚Äôs campaign weighed in on the protests Thursday evening. 
‚ÄúFrom the beginning of this campaign, Secretary Clinton has been clear that she thinks all voices should be heard and all views considered in federal infrastructure projects,‚Äù Spokeswoman Xochitl Hinojosa said in a statement. 
‚ÄúNow, all of the parties involved ‚Äî including the federal government, the pipeline company and contractors, the state of North Dakota, and the tribes ‚Äî need to find a path forward that serves the broadest public interest,‚Äù Hinojosa said. ‚ÄúAs that happens, it‚Äôs important that on the ground in North Dakota, everyone respects demonstrators‚Äô rights to protest peacefully, and workers‚Äô rights to do their jobs safely.‚Äù 
Protest camp coordinator Mekasi Horinek told NBC affiliate KFYR on Wednesday that the protesters had no plans of leaving their encampment. 
‚ÄúWe don‚Äôt have any plans on retreating. If they‚Äôre going to come in here and they‚Äôre going to arrest one of us, they‚Äôre going to arrest every one of us,‚Äù Horinek said. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre going to stand in unity, we‚Äôre going to stand in prayer, we‚Äôre going to stand in peace.‚Äù 
Standing Rock Sioux Tribe chairman Dave Archambault II told NBC News on Sunday the tribe had asked the U.S. Department of Justice to intervene in the escalating situation with law enforcement. 
‚ÄúThe DOJ should be enlisted and expected to investigate the overwhelming reports and videos demonstrating clear strong-arm tactics, abuses and unlawful arrests by law enforcement,‚Äù Chairman Dave Archambault II said.",1
Vatican Makes Unprecedented Agreement With Chinese Gov‚Äôt,"Vatican Makes Unprecedented Agreement With Chinese Gov‚Äôt 11/01/2016 
DAILY CALLER 
The Vatican and Beijing reached an agreement that will elevate the Chinese government above the Church, reports the Wall Street Journal. 
The question of who has the authority to ordain bishops has been at the heart of a decades-old dispute between China and the Vatican. 
The new agreement will give China the power to select bishops with only limited input from the Vatican. Furthermore, the Vatican will stop ordaining bishops for underground churches without the authorization of the Chinese government. While the pope will be acknowledged as the head of the Catholic Church in China, the Chinese government will have the last word on all appointments. The state will be able to pick individuals loyal to Beijing. 
The new deal is likely to help repair ties between the Vatican and the Chinese government, but the full restoration of diplomatic relations is still a long way off. 
The Chinese government and the Vatican have been estranged since the Communist Party of China (CPC) expelled Vatican envoy Antonio Riberi from the country in 1951, banned missionaries, and began oppressing organized religion. Pope Francis has been actively pursuing rapprochement with China. 
China insists on appointing its own bishops, claiming that oversight by the Holy See, the judicial body within the Catholic Church, constitutes unnecessary foreign intervention in Chinese affairs. China also opposes attempts by the Vatican to appoint bishops for underground churches without state authorization. 
In China, all Catholic organizations must register with the Chinese Patriotic Catholic Association. The Vatican expressed frustration over the Chinese government‚Äôs 2010 appointment of a bishop without Pope Benedict XVI‚Äôs approval. The Vatican called the move, one of a number of such occurrences, a ‚Äú painful wound ‚Äù to the Church. 
The new agreement could thaw relations between Beijing and the Vatican, giving the world‚Äôs largest religious organization access to the world‚Äôs most populous country. For China, normal interactions with the Vatican could improve its international image, potentially reducing criticisms of China‚Äôs human rights record. 
Negotiations for the new agreement reportedly began in April. Having reached an accord, negotiators are waiting for papal approval and a formal decision from the Chinese government. Once the agreement passes, it will mark an unprecedented shift in the Vatican‚Äôs interactions with foreign governments. The Vatican would officially accept the appointment of eight bishops, three of which were previously excommunicated. 
Some observers expect members of underground churches in China to protest the accord. 
‚ÄúIf the Vatican should be perceived as abandoning them, it could be seen as a betrayal‚Äù and ‚Äúcause serious divisions in the Chinese Catholic Church,‚Äù Richard Madsen, a professor of sociology at the University of California at San Diego, told the WSJ. ‚ÄúThe government would probably actually like this. Its action over the years show that it would like to see the church weakened, and a deeper division in the church would help accomplish that,‚Äù he added, highlighting his suspicions of Beijing‚Äôs intentions. 
China has a documented propensity for dominating and oppressing religion in order to better preserve state power. Christians played an important role in the shift from a dictatorship to a democracy in South Korea, and now there are an estimated 100 million Christians in China. 
Having failed to eradicate religion, the Chinese government, which is officially atheist, set up state-run churches with pastors loyal to China. These churches advocate morality, not scripture, and that the state is superior to religion. 
‚ÄúWe have to remember first of all we are a citizen of this country. We are a citizen of the Kingdom of God, but that comes second,‚Äù Pastor Wu Weiqing of the state-owned Haidian Church in Beijing told BBC. He further stated that if Jesus were alive today, he would probably be a member of the Communist Party. While the deal between the Vatican and Beijing could give the Catholic Church greater access to Chinese Christians, it could also give the Chinese government greater control over the Church and organized religion. 
Pope Francis ‚Äúwould not accept any agreement that would harm the integrity of faith of the universal Church,‚Äù the Bishop of Hong Kong, Cardinal John Tong argued in July, according to the WSJ. 
The future of the Catholic Church in China remains shrouded in uncertainty. The new agreement between Beijing and the Vatican could be a positive step forward or a dangerous surrender of religious power to political organizations like the Chinese Patriotic Catholic Association and the State Administration for Religious Affairs.",1

The exercises will see hundreds of heavily-armed and battle-ready Russian and NATO troops placed within a few hundreds miles of each. Montenegro‚Äôs Deputy Prime Minister Dusko Markovic said: ‚ÄúThis is an opportunity to work with NATO during the four-day exercise to determine our capacity and the capabilities of our response to natural disasters, as well as to recognise our weaknesses and eliminate them in time. ‚ÄúMontenegro has demonstrated the ability as a future member of NATO, not only through organising this exercise, but also bearing its burden. ‚ÄúMontenegro has demonstrated the ability to not only willing to accept but also help realise partnership goals.‚Äù Slavic Brotherhood 2016 will involve Russian troops and Serbian and Belarusian forces.

"FBI sees no ties between Trump, Putin","FBI sees no ties between Trump, Putin 11/01/2016 
PRESS TV 
The US Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) has found no clear links between Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump and Russia, officials say, proving false allegations by the candidate‚Äôs Democratic rival Hillary Clinton. 
The FBI spent most of the summer to verify claims by the Clinton campaign that Trump was linked to President Vladimir Putin, and Moscow was trying to influence the November 8 vote in his favor. 
However, the bureau failed to find any indications of the alleged ties after scrutinizing advisors close to Trump, investigating the real estate mogul‚Äôs financial ties and even his emails, the New York Times reported Tuesday, citing law enforcement officials. 
Clinton‚Äôs campaign voiced concerns about Moscow‚Äôs intervention after a series of emails belonging to various ranks of the Democratic Party were released by the anti-secrecy website Wikileaks. 
American intelligence officials blamed the hacks on Russia and even threatened to come up with countermeasures of the same nature. President Barack Obama and high-ranking officials in his administration also blamed Russia for the breaches. 
Under immense pressure from Clinton‚Äôs supporters, who were mad at Trump for calling Putin a great leader, the FBI started its investigation into the claims. 
The Clinton campaign has called on the FBI to publicly discuss their findings about the case, as they did with their new investigation into Clinton‚Äôs new emails. 
FBI chief James Comey told Congress on Friday that he was reopening investigations into Clinton‚Äôs emails after finding a trove of new emails on a laptop belonging to former representative Anthony Weiner, who was once married to Clinton‚Äôs top aide Huma Abedin. 
At some point during its investigation, the FBI questioned Paul Manafort, Trump‚Äôs former campaign boss, who has reportedly had extensive business ties in Russia and other former Soviet states, especially Ukraine, the Times noted. 
The bureau‚Äôs agents also investigated an email channel between Trump and the Alfa Bank, one of Russia‚Äôs biggest banks. 
After weeks of detailed investigation, the FBI concluded that the connection was nothing more than marketing emails or spam 
Trump has rejected Clinton‚Äôs allegations against Russia, and has pledged to work with Moscow and earn Putin‚Äôs respect.",1
"NATO, Russia To Hold Parallel Exercises In Balkans","NATO, Russia To Hold Parallel Exercises In Balkans 11/02/2016

Russia‚Äôs military and NATO forces are holding parallel military exercises in two neighboring Balkan countries. 
Russian troops will participate in war games in Serbia while NATO is conducting military drills in Montenegro, media reported on Monday. 
Russian forces‚Äô 13-day military exercise in Serbia is named ‚ÄúThe Slavic Brotherhood 2016‚Äù and begins on Wednesday. 
It will include 150 Russian paratroopers, 50 air force staffers, three transport planes and an unspecified number of troops from Serbia and Belarus, Russia‚Äôs Defense Ministry said. 
The five-day NATO drill in Montenegro started on Monday and involves responding to floods and chemical attacks. It will involve 680 unarmed personnel from seven NATO countries and 10 partner states. 
In the past both Serbia and Montenegro were constitutional republics of the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia. 
Both countries are socialist republics and traditional Russian Christian Orthodox allies. In 2003 this state union was re-formed into Serbia and Montenegro, and in 2006 the two became independent states. 
Since their split, the two Balkan neighbors seem to have headed in different directions strategically. 
Montenegro has taken a pro-Western stance which has been awarded by NATO with an offer to join the Northern Atlantic Alliance. 
The NATO invitation to Montenegro has met strong opposition from Russia. 
Meanwhile, Montenegrin officials have accused Russia of staging an alleged coup in October to topple its pro-Western government because of the NATO accession bid. 
Serbia, a NATO partner, has held exercises with the Western alliance, but not such a large one or with foreign troops and equipment participating on its soil.",1
S Korea coast guard opens fire on China boats,"S Korea coast guard opens fire on China boats 11/02/2016 
PRESS TV 
South Korean coast guard vessels have opened fire on Chinese trawlers allegedly fishing illegally off South Korea‚Äôs coast, prompting Beijing to censure Seoul. 
On Wednesday, senior coast guard official Kim Jung-shik said the order to fire machine guns had been given during a confrontation with some 30 Chinese fishing boats. 
The Chinese vessels had been allegedly operating illegally near South Korea‚Äôs Yellow Sea border with North Korea on Tuesday. 
‚ÄúThey tried to ram our ships although we repeatedly warned them,‚Äù Yonhap news agency quoted Kim as saying. 
The South Korean coast guard forces initially fired into the air but were later ordered to fire on the bows of the trawlers. 
‚ÄúI thought our officers would be in danger if I allowed any more resistance so we ended up using the crew service weapon,‚Äù Kim said. 
Two Chinese boats were seized in the incident, which reportedly caused no casualties. 
The machine gun shootout is the first of its kind since the South Korean coast guard declared in September that it would apply a ‚Äúmore aggressive‚Äù firearms policy with Chinese boats. 
The shooting left Beijing ‚Äústrongly dissatisfied‚Äù with China‚Äôs Foreign Ministry calling on Seoul to ‚Äúdiscipline‚Äù its coast guard. 
‚ÄúUsing destructive weapons can easily hurt fishermen and we urge the ROK (South Korea) side to ‚Ä¶ avoid using any excessive or extreme tools in their law enforcement activities,‚Äù said China‚Äôs Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying. 
Numerous incidents have occurred in recent years between South Korea‚Äôs coast guard and Chinese fishing boats venturing across international waters in search of fish. 
On October 10, Seoul said it had lodged a formal complaint with Beijing over the alleged sinking of a South Korean coast guard vessel by Chinese fishermen on October 7. 
On September 29, three Chinese fishermen died after their fishing boat was set on fire by South Korean coast guard members who threw grenades into their vessel.",1

Such technology will go a long way to defending allies against the Chinese menace and battling Moscow‚Äôs ‚Äúaggression‚Äù in the Baltics. 
The missile system is sponsored by an office created by Carter in 2012, the Strategic Capabilities Office, which is currently being lead by Will Roper, a protege‚Äô of the Secretary‚Äôs. During a panel at the Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS) on Friday Roper told an audience, ‚ÄúHow you offset the adversaries trying to offset your offset? It‚Äôs very simple to do that, you just don‚Äôt talk about your best capabilities‚Ä¶We are keeping our best ideas behind the door and probably always will,‚Äù according to Breaking Defense. 
After the panel, he continued, ‚ÄúWe thought it was important to come out (in public) with ATACMS for the Army because there‚Äôs been a lot of writing, a lot of speeches, on the need for the Army to go cross-domain.‚Äù High ranking officials in the US military have been calling for the ATACMS to extend its capabilities seaward for some time, and Roper responded to these concerns saying, ‚Äúit‚Äôs time for us to show it isn‚Äôt just a theoretical idea, it‚Äôs something we can potentially get to quickly with something that we already have.‚Äù 
During a morning session at CSIS Carter spoke of the new innovative features of the ATACMS, and how the SCO tries to maximize the potential of existing systems. 
‚ÄúA prominent theme of SCO‚Äôs work is spearheading creative and unexpected new ways to use our existing missiles and advanced munitions, and across varied domains‚Äù, he said, adding, ‚Äú‚Ä¶ By integrating an existing seeker onto the front of the missile, they‚Äôre enabling it to hit moving targets, both at sea as well as on land. With this capability, what was previously an Army surface-to-surface missile system can project power from coastal locations up to 300 kilometers into the maritime domain.‚Äù 
Carter detailed the SCO‚Äôs plans to utilize seeker technology that the Defense Department has already developed so the missile system can hit targets both on sea and land. 
Lockheed Martin was awarded the $174 million contract for the long range artillery rocket system in May 2015. Ken Musculus, vice president of tactical missiles at the defense contractor said at the time that ATACMS is ‚Äúreliable and proven in combat, which is why it continues to be our customers‚Äô choice for long-range strike requirements.‚Äù",1
Russia-US Plutonium Deal No Longer In Effect,"Russia-US Plutonium Deal No Longer In Effect 11/02/2016 
RUSSIA TODAY President Vladimir Putin has signed an act suspending a 2000 agreement between the US and Russia on reprocessing weapons-grade plutonium extracted from decommissioned warheads. 
The bill has already been published on Russia‚Äôs official legal information website, meaning it‚Äôs now in force. 
It mentions that a decision to restore the agreement can only be made by Russia‚Äôs president. 
The deal between Moscow and Washington was ratified in 2000. As a means to safely utilize weapons-grade plutonium, it suggested a specific procedure to turn it into nuclear plant fuel. Starting from 2018, it was planned to reprocess 34 tons (68,000 pounds) of plutonium, which would have been enough to produce thousands of nuclear weapons, RIA Novosti reported. 
Yet, while Russia has prepared the infrastructure necessary for the process, the US said it found the procedure too costly and instead opted for mixing plutonium with special dilutants to store it indefinitely. 
Russia suspended the deal ‚Äú due to drastic changes of circumstances, the rise of threat to strategic stability as a result of hostile actions of the US towards the Russian Federation and the inability of the US to provide for the accepted obligations to utilize the excess weapons-grade plutonium in accordance with the agreement ,‚Äù the new bill read. 
For the agreement to be resumed, Washington should reduce the US military presence on the territory of NATO members that joined the bloc after 2000, cancel its Magnitsky Act which bans entry to the US to a list of Russian citizens, as well as lift other anti-Russian sanctions and compensate the loss Moscow suffered as a result of such policy. 
The bill on suspension ‚Äì which is a ‚Äú forced measure ,‚Äù according to Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov ‚Äì was first submitted by the president‚Äôs office earlier this month and then approved by parliament. 
Commenting on the suspension of the deal, Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Sergey Ryabkov has said that it would not affect any of Moscow‚Äôs other commitments related to international nuclear security and does not interfere with the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty.",1
Half Of Russians Fear Syria Could Spark WW3,"Half Of Russians Fear Syria Could Spark WW3 11/02/2016 
RUSSIA TODAY Almost half of all respondents in a recent Russian opinion poll said they feared that the aggravation of relations between Russia and the West caused by the ongoing crisis in Syria could develop into a global military conflict. 
The share of those who see the probability of World War Three in the near future as high or very high is now at 48 percent and those who appraise it as low or very low comprise 42 percent of society, the privately-owned public opinion research center Levada reported on Monday. The remaining 10 percent of respondents said they couldn‚Äôt give a simple answer to the question. 
When researchers asked citizens if they considered it possible that Russia and the West would eventually find a mutually acceptable solution to the crisis, 35 percent answered that this scenario was likely or very likely. Thirty-nine percent evaluate the probability of such an outcome as low or very low and 26 percent said that they couldn‚Äôt answer the question. 
Just over half ‚Äì 52 percent ‚Äì of Russians said they approve of their country‚Äôs involvement in the Syrian conflict and 26 percent said they had a negative or sharply negative attitude to this. Just under a quarter ‚Äì 23 percent ‚Äì couldn‚Äôt answer the question about their personal view on the subject. Those who thought that Russia should continue the operation and those who thought that airstrikes should be stopped were divided 49 percent against 28 percent respectively, with 24 percent finding the question too difficult to answer. 
The level of awareness about the situation in Syria and the Russian Air Force operation against Islamic State (IS, formerly ISIS/ISIL) terrorists there remained fairly high. Eighteen percent said they were very closely following developments in Syria and 64 percent revealed partial familiarity with the issue. Just under a fifth ‚Äì 17 percent ‚Äì said that they were not interested in news about Syria. 
A similar poll conducted a year ago by the independent Levada Center showed that over 70 percent of Russian citizens supported the air operations against IS terrorists in Syria, and almost a half of them agreed that it was right for Russia to support the government of Syria‚Äôs democratically-elected President Bashar Assad. 
A different poll conducted earlier this month by the state-run research center VTSIOM showed that 73 percent of Russians believed that Western criticism of the air force‚Äôs counter-terrorism operation in Aleppo, Syria, was ungrounded and prejudiced. Only 6 percent said the allegations of wrongdoing on the part of the Russian military have some basis in reality. 
Russia first deployed an air force contingent in Syria in 2015, after receiving a request for military help from the Syrian government, which is currently battling Islamic State and affiliated groups. Russian war planes began launching airstrikes on terrorists in Syria on September 30, 2015. Their work has aided the Syrian military in achieving considerable success in driving jihadist forces out of the country.",1
FBI Releases Clinton Foundation Investigation Records,"FBI Releases Clinton Foundation Investigation Records 11/02/2016 
DAILY CALLER 
The FBI on Tuesday released documents related to a now-closed federal investigation of an alleged pay-to-play scheme involving Bill Clinton and the Clinton Foundation. 
The documents, which are heavily redacted, regard the investigation of Clinton‚Äôs last-minute pardon of Marc Rich, a billionaire fugitive who was wanted in the U.S. for tax evasion. 
The Jan. 20, 2001 pardon sparked the last controversy to befall the scandal-plagued Clinton administration. Rich‚Äôs ex-wife, Denise, donated more than $1 million to various Clinton and Democratic entities, including the Democratic National Committee, Hillary Clinton‚Äôs New York Senate campaign and the Clinton Foundation. 
The release provides little in the way of information that has not already been publicized. But the dump is noteworthy for two reasons. It reminds voters that the Clinton White House and Clinton Foundation were embroiled in an investigation concerning pay-to-play allegations. The Clinton Foundation is reportedly being investigated at the present by multiple FBI field offices. 
It also comes as the FBI is locked in a bitter standoff with the Clinton Foundation and the Justice Department over FBI director James Comey‚Äôs handling of the Hillary Clinton email investigation. 
The newly-released files include one entry which shows that ‚Äúthe required pardon standards and procedures were not followed‚Äù prior to the Rich pardon. 
Roger Adams, the U.S. Pardon Attorney at the time, testified to Congress in Feb. 2001 that ‚Äúnone of the regular procedures were followed‚Äù ahead of the Rich reprieve. 
Former Attorney General Eric Holder is also mentioned in the file. It cites Holder‚Äôs testimony that he was the only person who worked at DOJ ‚Äî he was deputy attorney general at the time ‚Äî about the Rich pardon. From the FBI‚Äôs Clinton Foundation investigation files 
A grand jury was convened to weigh the merits of the case, but no indictments were handed down. Ironically, the law enforcement official who closed the case was FBI director Comey. He served as deputy attorney general in the George W. Bush administration. 
The FBI‚Äôs website suggests that more Clinton Foundation investigation records could be coming in the future. 
‚ÄúThis initial release consists of material from the FBI‚Äôs files related to the William J. Clinton Foundation , a non-profit 501(c)(3) organization,‚Äù the site reads. ‚ÄúThe bulk of these records come from a 2001 FBI investigation into the pardon of Marc Rich (1934-2013), aka Marcell David Reich, by President Clinton in 2001; it was closed in 2005.‚Äù 
The FBI did not respond to a request for more information on future releases. 
Update: Clinton campaign press secretary Brian Fallon questioned the release. 
The FBI issued a statement late Tuesday afternoon saying that the file was released in response to a FOIA request. 
‚ÄúThe FBI‚Äôs Records Management Division receives thousands of FOIA requests annually which are processed on a first in, first out (FIFO) basis,‚Äù the statement reads. 
‚ÄúBy law, FOIA materials that have been requested three or more times are posted electronically to the FBI‚Äôs public reading room shortly after they are processed. Per the standard procedure for FOIA, these materials became available for release and were posted automatically and electronically to the FBI‚Äôs public reading room in accordance with the law and established procedures.‚Äù",1
Russia‚Äôs Most Potent Weapon: ‚ÄúHoarding Gold‚Äù,"Russia‚Äôs Most Potent Weapon: ‚ÄúHoarding Gold‚Äù 11/02/2016 
SHTFPLAN.COM 
This article was written by Jay Syrmopoulos and originally published at The Free Thought Project . 
Editor‚Äôs Comment: He who holds the gold makes the rules? Fresh attempts at containing Russia and continuing the empire have been met with countermoves. Russia appears to be building strength in every way. Putin and his country have no intention of being under the American thumb, and are developing rapid resistance as the U.S. petrodollar loses its grip and China, Russia and the East shift into new currencies and shifting world order. 
What lies ahead? It will be a strong hand for the countries that have the most significant backing in gold and hard assets; and China and Russia have positioned themselves very well. Prepare for a changing economic landscape, and one in which self-reliance might be all we have. 
Russia is Hoarding Gold at an Alarming Rate ‚Äî The Next World War Will Be Fought with Currencies 
by Jay Syrmopoulos 
With all eyes on Russia‚Äôs unveiling their latest nuclear intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM), which NATO has dubbed the ‚ÄúSATAN‚Äù missile , as tensions with the U.S. increase, Moscow‚Äôs most potent ‚Äúweapon‚Äù may be something drastically different. 
The rapidly evolving geopolitical ‚Äúweapon‚Äù brandished by Russia is an ever increasing stockpile of gold, as well as Russia‚Äôs native currency, the ruble. 
Take a look at the symbol below, as it could soon come to change the entire hierarchy of the international order ‚Äì potentially ushering in a complete international paradigm shift ‚Äì and much sooner than you might think. 
image: http://thefreethoughtproject.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/bankofrussia-e1475520013798.png 
The symbol is the new designation of the Russian ruble, Russia‚Äôs national currency. 
Similar to how the U.S. uses the dollar sign ($), the U.K. uses the pound sign (¬£), and the European Union uses the euro symbol (‚Ç¨), Russia is about to begin exporting its symbol internationally. 
After the failed ‚Äúreset‚Äù in U.S./Russian relations by the Obama administration, and the continued deterioration of the countries relationship, Washington began targeting entire sectors of the Russian economy, as well as specific individuals, meant to impose an economic burden so severe that it would force Moscow into compliance. 
Instead of decimating Russia, what it precipitated was a Russian response of gradually weaning themselves off of the hegemony of the U.S. petrodollar, and working with China to create an alternative to the SWIFT payment system that isn‚Äôt solely controlled by Western interests (see Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank , New Development Bank). 
According to the Corbett Report : 
New reports indicate that China is ready to launch its SWIFT alternative, and for those who have their ear to the ground this is the most significant move yet in the unfolding process of de-dollarization that is seeing the BRICS-led ‚Äúresistance bloc‚Äù breaking away from the financial stranglehold of the US-led ‚ÄúWashington Consensus.‚Äù 
For those who don‚Äôt know, SWIFT stands for the Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication and is shorthand for the SWIFTNet Network that is used by over 10,500 financial institutions in 215 countries and territories to transmit financial transaction data around the world. SWIFT does not do any of the clearing or processing for these transactions itself, but instead sends the payment orders that are then settled by correspondent banks of the member institutions. Still, given the system‚Äôs near universality in the financial system, it means that virtually every international transaction between banking institutions goes through the SWIFT network. 
This is why de-listing from the SWIFT network remains one of the primary financial weapons wielded by the US and its allies in their increasingly important financial warfare campaigns. 
Recently, financial guru Jim Rickards, author of the book ‚ÄúCurrency Wars,‚Äù wrote that ‚ÄúRussia is poised for a major comeback in its economy. Russian bonds and stocks and the Russian currency, the ruble, will all benefit.‚Äù Rickards believes a ‚Äústrong turnaround‚Äù is coming within Russia, and that this comeback will benefit the ruble. 
While still suffering from the economic warfare being waged by the U.S., Russia has realized that as long they are subservient to the petrodollar, there remains a clear and present danger of the Russian economy being devastated by the whims of Washington. 
The Bank of Russia, that nation‚Äôs central bank, is extremely clear about its mission, and monetary policy declaring on its website: 
Monetary policy constitutes an integral part of the state policy and is aimed at enhancing well-being of Russian citizens. The Bank of Russia implements monetary policy in the framework of inflation-targeting regime, and sees price stability, albeit sustainably low inflation, as its priority. Given structural peculiarities of the Russian economy, the target is to reduce inflation to 4% by 2017 and maintain it within that range in the medium run. 
In layman‚Äôs terms, that means that monetary policy, similar to nuclear weapons and the military, are ‚Äúan integral part of the state policy‚Äù in Russia. While many analysts have noted the increased build-up in Russia‚Äôs military arsenal, seemingly few have highlighted the massive build-up of Russian gold reserves over the past decade. 
Below is a chart showing Russian gold reserves between 1994 and last year, 2015: 
Since 2006, there has been a year-on-year increase that reveals a significant upward trend. The chart clearly reveals that Russia‚Äôs state policy of increasing state monetary assets, in the form of gold. Additionally, the Russian government has been converting state rubles into gold assets. From 2006 to 2015, Russia‚Äôs state holdings of gold tripled. 
Within just the past year Russia has substantially increased its gold holdings 
According to the Business Insider : 
In July of this year, the central bank of Russia added 200,000 ounces of gold to its reserves. The one-month uptick in Russian gold reserves ‚Äî 200,000 ounces ‚Äî is approximately equal to the entire annual output of Barrick Gold‚Äôs Turquoise Ridge gold mine in Nevada. 
At that same rate ‚Äî 200,000 ounces per month ‚Äî in a mere five months, Russia would add to state gold reserves the equivalent of the entire annual output of Barrick‚Äôs massive Goldstrike mine in Nevada. 
Currently, Russian gold reserves rank seventh in the world. It‚Äôs clear that there is a concerted effort by Russian authorities to build up the country‚Äôs gold reserves as part of a national strategy to negate the effects of economic warfare waged by the United States. 
Rickards, in his 2011 book ‚ÄúCurrency Wars,‚Äù theorized that Russia and China could combine their gold reserves to form a global gold-backed currency to compete against the U.S. dollar. Currently, Russian reserves stand at roughly 1,500 tonnes, with Chinese reserves totaling over 1,800 tonnes (according to China ‚Äî it‚Äôs likely more), which would amount to a combined total of roughly 3,300 tonnes of gold. 
The U.S. is about to lose overarching control of policymaking within the International Monetary Fund (IMF), thus the U.S. lockup on global gold is about to vanish, according to Business Insider. 
Imagine for a moment the distinctly real possibility that Russian-Chinese alliance could exercise indirect (or even direct) control over the IMF‚Äôs gold reserve of over 2,800 tonnes. Russian, Chinese and IMF gold combined would equal roughly 6,100 tonnes, and would allow for direct competition with the U.S. gold reserves, estimated at 8,100 tonnes. 
Russia and China have realized that the petrodollar is wielded by Washington as it‚Äôs weapon of choice when opposing a well-armed state, and clearly see the writing on the wall ‚Äì thus working together to create a new global financial paradigm. 
The reality is that the United States is $20 trillion dollars in debt, and eventually the time will come when the U.S. economy begins to implode ‚Äî and all the fiat currency people are stuck holding will essentially be worth nothing more than the paper it‚Äôs printed on. Hard assets, such as gold and silver, should be bought and taken custody of while there is still an opportunity to do so, as a means of hedging against the potentially disastrous results of the U.S. using the petrodollar as a ‚Äúweapon.‚Äù 
Ultimately, the United States, Russia and China are all controlled by centralized power-hungry tyrants attempting to command powerful global bureaucracies like the IMF, the World Bank, SWIFT, New Development Bank and the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank. 
It‚Äôs not Russian nuclear weapons that people should fear, as the policy of mutually assured destruction essentially voids any benefit of a state launching a first-strike nuclear attack. The true threat to America is our economic house of cards, built upon the back of a neoliberal trade policy that puts the ‚Äúrights‚Äù of corporations over that of people .

China Airport Security Robot Gives Electroshocks,"China Airport Security Robot Gives Electroshocks 11/02/2016 
ACTIVIST POST 
While debate surrounds the threat of autonomous ‚Äúkiller robots,‚Äù the mechanized replacement of humans continues across the workforce. 
The industrial robotics industry is logging record sales worldwide, and there appears to be no sign of a slowdown. As you can see in the graphic below, 2015 sales surged 12% over a previous record year to reach almost 1/4 million units. 
There are many factors driving this growth, which you can read about here; but one point worth noting is that the two leading countries are the US and China, with China leading the way. 
The nature of robotics is also changing, as new developments in artificial intelligence are giving robots an increasing range of potential uses. One key area, of course, is security. Robot security guards have already begun appearing at prisons , care facilities , and schools, in various locations around the world. 
One U.S. robot company, Gamma 2 Robotics, has designed several models for mass production. Their latest ‚Äì RAMSEE ‚Äì can be seen in the video below. A true mass roll-out of this fully autonomous security guard could significantly impact the 1.5 million humans that are currently employed in some form of security patrol. 
RAMSEE advertises the following capabilities: Is a physical presence that autonomously patrols without supervision Provides real-time data: intruders, motion, heat, fire, smoke, gases & more Is a human-machine interface that creates a powerful force multiplier 
Significantly, Gamma 2 Robotics has partnered with Hexagon Safety & Infrastructure: ‚Äúthe global leader in public safety and security solutions.‚Äù 
However, RAMSEE is missing one thing: weapons. For that, we have to travel to China, where they seem to have embraced police robots full throttle. 
In late 2015, I covered an announcement from China‚Äôs Xinhua news agency where they announced the development and deployment of 3 weaponized ‚Äúanti-terrorism‚Äù robots that would be far more active than a mere patrol: 
‚ÄúThe toy-sized robots can coordinate with each other on the battlefield,‚Äù said the report, following their unveiling at the 2015 World Robot Conference in Beijing. 
The first model is known as a ‚Äúreconnaissance‚Äù robot, which scouts for poisonous gases, dangerous chemicals and explosives before transmitting its findings back to base.If this initial investigation detects a simple bomb is the source of danger, the second robot model ‚Äì a small explosive ordnance disposal (EOD) machine ‚Äì would be sent in to diffuse it. 
But with other, more complicated threats, an attacker robot would start its mission, armed with ‚Äúminor-caliber weapons, recoilless rifles and grenade launchers‚Äù. 
‚ÄúWith a sighting telescope, a trigger and a safe installed, the attacker can hit its target from a long distance,‚Äù Xinhua said. 
The local police force in Beijing was reported to be among the buyers for the three robots , which are priced at 1.5 million yuan (¬£156,000) for the set by manufacturers HIT Robot Group, who are based in the northern city of Harbin. 
‚ÄúApart from anti-terror operations, they can also be applied in fire fighting, public security, forestry and agriculture,‚Äù the company‚Äôs sales manager Chen Deqiang said, according to Xinhua. 
If we have learned anything about anti-terrorism efforts, authorities consider front-line deployment to be areas of public travel. We were given the TSA based on such notions, and have since witnessed its intrusive role in airports, and soon-to-be at other public transportation if authorities have their way. 
China has gone to the next level with a robot TSA of sorts called AnBot that is equipped with what is essentially a taser-like device that is being fittingly compared to a cattle-prod. 
Image Credit 
It was first introduced at a tech show earlier in the year, and was speculated to have been designed for protest suppression. For now, its first job is to patrol China‚Äôs Shenzhen airport. 
Most alarming, however, is that it is tied to one of the most powerful supercomputers on the planet. 
The back end of this ‚Äúintelligent security robot‚Äù is l inked to China‚Äôs Tianhe-2 supercomputer , where it has access to cloud services . AnBot conducts patrols, recognizes threats and has multiple cameras that use facial recognition. 
These cloud services give the robots petascale processing power , well beyond onboard processing capabilities in the robot. The supercomputer connection is there ‚Äúto enhance the intelligent learning capabilities and human-machine interface of these devices,‚Äù said the U.S.-China Economic and Security Review, in a report released Tuesday that examines China‚Äôs autonomous systems development efforts . [emphasis added] 
( Source ) 
This link to ‚Äúcloud services‚Äù is a new trend in robot artificial intelligence that also has been referred to as the Wikipedia for Robots ‚Äì essentially an Internet Cloud Brain. Through robot-to-robot information sharing they can speed up their learning process ‚Ä¶ autonomously. Examples have included robots that can learn to cook, and robots that can learn the tasks involved in care-giving. However, when applied to policing, things become much more ethically troubling. 
People were outraged in the U.S., for example, when a robot in Dallas was used to deliver a pound of C-4 explosive to a U.S. citizen whom the police deemed a sufficient threat worthy of immediate execution. At least, in that case, a human made the decision. But it is being viewed as a tip-toe along the path to the widespread use of ‚Äúkiller robots‚Äù much as we have seen with the use of drones. Discussion was once limited to overseas ‚Äì egregious enough ‚Äì but there has been a growing voice of those who are urging weaponized domestic police drones. 
As John Vibes wrote , it might be inevitable: 
The Taser corporation is planning on building a drone that is equipped with a stun gun, according to a recent report by the Wall Street Journal. 
Not only will the drones be equipped with tasers, but there is also talk of them being autonomous, meaning that an actual human won‚Äôt necessarily be needed to fly the drone. 
This is actually already being done in India , the first country to have approved the use of drones attached with ‚Äúnon-lethal‚Äù weapons. And, just this week, British tabloid, The Sun , had a feature entitled ‚ÄúVladimir Putin‚Äôs Russia is preparing an army of robots and drones to take on its enemies, Deputy PM Dmitry Rogozin admits.‚Äù Given the available facts, this title no longer seems so deliberately sensational. 
Clearly we are entering a potentially dangerous convergence of expanding robotic artificial intelligence along with the political will to continue allowing robots more and more autonomy as they carry out the traditional duties of the military and police. Some experts argue that the precision of robotics will curb many of the abuses we have seen from our military and police. But is that the trend we are actually seeing? Or will automated systems of violent control inevitably lead to even greater industrial-level suppression and killing?

WikiLeaks Documents Reveal United Nations Interest In UFOs,"WikiLeaks Documents Reveal United Nations Interest In UFOs 11/02/2016 
HUFFINGTON POST 
Revelations in a set of hacked emails released by WikiLeaks earlier this month have sparked new conversations about UFOs and speculation that extraterrestrials have been visiting Earth. But a very significant ‚Äï and possibly overlooked ‚Äï group of WikiLeaks items relevant to the topic was released on May 18, 2015. 
WikiLeaks posted more than half a million U.S. State Department diplomatic documents from 1978 detailing America‚Äôs interactions with countries all around the world ‚Äï including Grenada Prime Minister Eric Gairy‚Äôs efforts to organize a United Nations-based committee to research and investigate global UFO reports. 
Many of the documents, written by American UN officials, indicated how closely they were monitoring Grenada‚Äôs UFO-related activities. 
One document , from Nov. 18, 1978, revealed my involvement in helping Grenada to produce a credible UFO presentation. 
I had an opportunity in early 1978 to meet Gairy in New York to present an idea about how I thought the UN would pay attention to his UFO crusade. Through his ambassadors, I gave him a copy of a documentary record album, ‚ÄúUFOs: The Credibility Factor,‚Äù that I produced for CBS Inc. in 1975. 
Gairy and I met, and after I convinced him I could bring a very credible group of speakers to the UN, he agreed to sponsor my proposal (see image below). Shortly after a handshake deal, he made me a temporary delegate-adviser of Grenada and the rest was, well, history. COURTESY OF LEE SPEIGEL This 1978 letter from Grenada to Lee Speigel confirmed that country‚Äôs commitment to sponsor Speigel‚Äôs UFO presentation at the United Nations. 
The following image shows part of the group I brought together in July 1978 to meet with UN Secretary-General Kurt Waldheim. He wanted to know what we were planning to do at our November event in front of the Special Political Committee, which included representatives from the Committee on the Peaceful Uses of Outer Space. COURTESY OF LEE SPEIGEL On July 14, 1978, producer Lee Speigel (now a Huffington Post writer) brought together a group of military, scientific and psychological experts to meet with United Nations Secretary-General Kurt Waldheim to discuss Speigel‚Äôs upcoming presentation to the U.N. Special Political Committee later that year. Topic: The importance of establishing an international UFO committee. Pictured from left: USAF astronaut Col. Gordon Cooper, astronomer Jacques Vallee, astronomer/astrophysicist Claude Poher, astronomer J. Allen Hynek, Grenada Prime Minister Sir Eric Gairy, Waldheim, Morton Gleisner of the Special Political Committee, Lee Speigel, researcher Leonard Stringfield and University of Colorado psychologist David Saunders. 
Another cable posted on WikiLeaks , from Nov. 24, 1978, refers to Ambassador Richard Petree‚Äôs meeting with Grenada representatives ‚Äúto discuss their UFO resolution. Ambassador Petree acknowledged the high level of interest in UFOs among some elements of the private sector and scientific community ‚Ä¶ and pointed to the budgetary impact as a major concern of the U.S. and other countries.‚Äù 
On Nov. 28, 1978, the day after our presentation at the UN, this document was sent through official channels, detailing the actual UFO event, describing what each of the invited scientific and military speakers had to say to the member nations. 
A few days after that, on Dec. 2, 1978, a follow-up cable was transmitted, including the following: 
Subsequent to the introduction of the Grenadian UFO resolution, Misoff [Mission Officer] has engaged in two separate informal negotiating sessions, which included representation from Austria, USSR and Grenada, in an attempt to arrive at a mutually acceptable compromise solution to the problem. 
A draft decision to be taken by the Special Political Committee (SPC) has been agreed upon by the participants in the informal negotiations, subject to concurrence of their respective capitals. We think referral of the [UFO] matter to the Outer Space Committee (OSC) without a preordained mandate as to what action is to be taken, provides the flexibility the OSC needs to take whatever action it deems appropriate. 
It will also obviate the need to vote on a resolution (and gamble on the results). 
The following week brought forth another document , on Dec. 8, 1978, which stated: 
‚ÄúThe General Assembly invites interested member states to take appropriate steps to coordinate on a national level scientific research and investigation into extraterrestrial life, including unidentified flying objects, and to inform the secretary-general of the observations, research and evaluation of such activities.‚Äù 
It was further suggested that Grenada‚Äôs views on UFOs could be discussed in 1979. Unfortunately, that didn‚Äôt come to pass, as Grenada Prime Minister Gairy was overthrown in a 1979 coup. 
Needless to say, without the Gairy-based initiative on UFOs, it was quietly relegated to Grenada‚Äôs back burner. 
This is the tip of the UFO-UN iceberg. It shows how the subject of UFOs wasn‚Äôt merely officially ridiculed or slapped aside. There was, and perhaps still is, some interest there, just waiting to emerge.",1
Suspect captured in ‚Äòambush-style‚Äô killings of two Iowa cops,"Suspect captured in ‚Äòambush-style‚Äô killings of two Iowa cops 11/02/2016 
USA TODAY 
Authorities captured a 46-year-old male suspect without incident Wednesday, hours after an early-morning ‚Äúambush-style‚Äù killing of two police officers in the Des Moines metro area. 
The suspect in the back-to-back killings was identified as Scott Michael Greene, said Urbandale police spokesman Sgt. Chad Underwood. Before capturing him, police had described Greene, who was last seen driving a blue Ford F-150 with an Iowa license plate, as armed and dangerous. 
Greene was taken into custody by the Dallas County Sheriff‚Äôs Department while walking along a rural road in Redfield, about 35 miles west of where the shootings occurred. 
According to police, Greene flagged down a passing Department of Natural Resources officer, handed over his ID and told the officer to call police. No shots were fired and there was no struggle, according to police. 
The suspect was taken by ambulance to a Des Moines hospital with an unknown injury. 
In a late morning news conference, police identified the slain officers as Urbandale Police Officer Justin Martin and Des Moines police Sgt. Anthony ‚ÄúTony‚Äù Beminio. 
The attacks began around 1:06 a.m. CT, when police departments from both cities responded to reports of gunfire at the intersection of 70th Street and Aurora Avenue in Urbandale. 
The first officers arriving on the scene found Martin fatally wounded. About 20 minutes later, some two miles away, Beminio was was shot near the intersection of Merle Hay Road and Sheridan Ave. while responding to reports of the first officer‚Äôs shooting. Beminio was transported to Iowa Methodist Medical Center, where he died. Scott Michael Greene (Photo: Des Moines Police) 
Both officers were gunned down in their patrol cars. 
‚ÄúIt doesn‚Äôt look like there was any interaction between these officers and whoever the coward is that shot them while they sat in their cars,‚Äù a visibly emotional Parizek told reporters.

Des Moines police, fearing officers were being singled out, paired up its patrol officers so none were on the street alone, Parizek said. 
‚ÄúThere‚Äôs literally a clear and present danger if you‚Äôre a police officer,‚Äù he said. 
Police did not offer many details on how investigators identified Greene as a suspect. Underwood said he was identified ‚Äúthrough a series of leads and a series of investigative tips.‚Äù 
As of an early-morning news conference, police were still notifying the family members of the slain officers and planned to withhold the officers‚Äô names, years of service and other details until later in the day, Parizek said. 
Attorney General Loretta Lynch condemned the killings, saying ‚Äúviolence has no place in the United States of America.‚Äô‚Äô 
‚ÄúLet me be clear, there is no message in murder,‚Äô‚Äô the attorney general said, referring to simmering distrust between law enforcement and many communities across the country. ‚ÄúViolence creates nothing; it only destroys.‚Äô‚Äô A Des Moines police officer was found fatally shot in a vehicle near the intersection of Merle Hay Road and Sheridan Avenue in Des Moines on Wednesday, Nov. 2, 2016. (Photo: Brian Powers, The Des Moines Register) 
It‚Äôs the first time Des Moines has seen a police officer shot and killed in the line of duty since two officers were gunned down in separate incidents in 1977. 
Two Des Moines officers, Susan Farrell and Carlos Puente-Morales, died earlier this year when their vehicle was struck head-on by a wrong-way drunk driver. 
The killing of the Urbandale officer appeared to be the city‚Äôs first for an officer shot in the line of duty, Underwood said at the news conference. 
Parizek thanked the community for its support when the department lost Farrell and Puente-Morales, as well as with this tragedy. 
‚ÄúI don‚Äôt even know where to begin on how bad this year is,‚Äù he said. But, ‚Äúthis is what we do. We come in day in and day out, we go out there and provide the same level of service regardless of what‚Äôs going on in our personal and professional lives.‚Äù Officers investigate the scene at Merle Hay and Sheridan ave. where an officer was found shot at about 1:26 A.M. on on Wednesday, Nov. 2, 2016, in Urbandale. 
In a statement, Iowa Gov. Terry Branstad called the attack on the officers ‚Äúan attack on the public safety of all Iowans.‚Äù 
‚ÄúWe call on Iowans to support our law enforcement officials in bringing this suspect to justice,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúOur thoughts and prayers go out to the families of the police officers who were tragically killed in the line of duty as well as the officers who continue to put themselves in harm‚Äôs way.‚Äù 
Iowa Sen. Joni Ernst extended her thoughts and prayers to the families of the officers killed. 
‚ÄúAlthough the investigation is still unfolding, what appears to be an ambush attack of police in the line of duty is an attack on the community at large and all of the men and women who risk their lives every day to protect us,‚Äù Ernst said. ‚ÄúThis was a senseless act of violence and it cannot be tolerated.‚Äù

Warning or threat? Hillary hints at second civil war if Trump wins,"Warning or threat? Hillary hints at second civil war if Trump wins 11/02/2016 
While speaking to supporters in Cincinnati on Monday, Democrat Hillary Clinton hinted at a second civil war if GOP nominee Donald Trump wins, Breitbart.com reported. 
Charlie Spiering wrote: 
‚ÄúHe has a dark and divisive vision for America that could tear our country apart,‚Äù Clinton said to supporters in Cincinnati, Ohio on Halloween. 
Clinton specifically referred to the Civil War, suggesting that the country faced a similar threat of divisiveness from Donald Trump. 
‚ÄúAbraham Lincoln understood a house divided against itself cannot stand, and that was over the greatest of challenges ‚Äì the challenge posed by slavery ‚Äì and we fought a civil war,‚Äù she said. 
She warned voters that it was time for the country to take the divisions in the country seriously. 
‚ÄúBut we also have to take stock of how divided we are today, the kinds of divisions that need to be healed to bring people together,‚Äù she added, failing to admit that her side is the one that has divided America by race, class and gender. 
She also claimed that Trump would start a nuclear war if a foreign leader got under his skin. 
‚ÄúI know there are some who will say that any discussion of this topic could be fear-mongering, but I don‚Äôt think so,‚Äù she said at a rally in Kent, Ohio, earlier in the day. 
A post at Barracuda Brigade observed: 
Liberals especially the Clinton are always projecting. Anything that they accuse the other side of is what they are doing. She suggests that her message is one of ‚Äúhope and change‚Äù when in fact it is just more of the same. 
Moreover, Trump has spent a great deal of time talking about policies and issues while Clinton & Co. have done absolutely nothing but engage in fear-mongering and fingerpointing. 
Still, we have to ask ‚Äî was Clinton‚Äôs ‚Äúhint‚Äù a ‚Äúwarning‚Äù or a ‚Äúthreat?‚Äù

U.S. militia girds for trouble as presidential election nears,"U.S. militia girds for trouble as presidential election nears 11/02/2016 
REUTERS 
Down a Georgia country road, camouflaged members of the Three Percent Security Force have mobilized for rifle practice, hand-to-hand combat training ‚Äî and an impromptu campaign rally for Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump. 
‚ÄúHow many people are voting for Trump? Ooh-rah!‚Äù asks Chris Hill, a paralegal who goes by the code name ‚ÄúBloodagent.‚Äù 
‚ÄúOoh-rah!‚Äù shout a dozen militia members in response, as morning sunlight sifted through the trees last weekend. 
As the most divisive presidential election in recent memory nears its conclusion, some armed militia groups are preparing for the possibility of a stolen election on Nov. 8 and civil unrest in the days following a victory by Democrat Hillary Clinton. 
They say they won‚Äôt fire the first shot, but they‚Äôre not planning to leave their guns at home, either. 
Trump‚Äôs populist campaign has energized militia members like Hill, who admire the Republican mogul‚Äôs promise to deport illegal immigrants, stop Muslims from entering the country and build a wall along the Mexico border. Trump has repeatedly warned that the election may be ‚Äúrigged,‚Äù and has said he may not respect the results if he does not win. At least one paramilitary group, the Oath Keepers, has called on members to monitor voting sites for signs of fraud. 
Armed paramilitary groups first gained prominence in the early 1990s, fueled by confrontations in Ruby Ridge, Idaho and Waco, Texas, culminating in a militia sympathizer‚Äôs 1995 bombing of a federal office building in Oklahoma City that killed 168 people. 
Their numbers dwindled following that attack but have spiked in recent years, driven by fears that President Barack Obama will threaten gun ownership and erode the power of local government. The Southern Poverty Law Center, which tracks extremist groups, estimates there were 276 active militias last year, up from 42 in 2008. 
In recent years, armed groups have confronted federal authorities in a series of land-use disputes in the western United States. Federal officials fear more clashes could come after seven militants were acquitted on conspiracy charges for occupying a federal wildlife refuge in Oregon. 
Many fear Clinton would push the county further to the left. 
‚ÄúThis is the last chance to save America from ruin,‚Äù Hill said. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm surprised I was able to survive or suffer through eight years of Obama without literally going insane, but Hillary is going to be more of the same.‚Äù 

EXTREMIST GROUPS EMBOLDENED 
The Oath Keepers, a prominent anti-government force that sent gun-toting members to the 2014 race riots in Ferguson, Missouri, called on members last week to monitor voting sites on election day for any signs of fraud. 
An hour south of Atlanta, the Three Percent Security Force started the day around the campfire, taking turns shooting automatic pistols and rifles at a makeshift target range. They whooped with approval when blasts from one member‚Äôs high-powered rifle knocked down a tree. 
The group operates independently, but is affiliated with a national armed movement that calls for members to defend individual rights in the face of what they see as an overreaching federal government. The movement draws its name from the notion that no more than 3 percent of the American population fought in the Revolutionary War against Britain. 
Amid the war games, Hill weighed plans for a possible armed march on Washington if Clinton wins. 
He said he doesn‚Äôt want his members leading the way, but they will defend the protesters if need be. His group will not hesitate to act if a President Clinton tries to disarm gun owners, he said. 
‚ÄúI will be there to render assistance to my fellow countrymen, and prevent them from being disarmed, and I will fight and I will kill and I may die in the process,‚Äù said Hill, who founded the militia several years ago. 
Trump‚Äôs candidacy has emboldened extremist groups to speak more openly about challenging the rule of law, said Ryan Lenz, a researcher at the Southern Poverty Law Center. 
‚ÄúPrior to this campaign season, these ideas were relegated to sort of the political fringe of the American political landscape,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúNow these ideas are legitimized.‚Äù 
Over the past week, some prominent Trump supporters have hinted at violence. 
‚ÄúIf Trump loses, I‚Äôm grabbing my musket,‚Äù former Illinois Representative Joe Walsh wrote on Twitter last week. Conservative commentator Wayne Root fantasized about Clinton‚Äôs death while speaking at a Trump rally in Las Vegas on Sunday. 
Back in Georgia, the Three Percent Security Force wrapped up rifle practice in the midday sun. They then headed further into the trees to tackle an obstacle course with loaded pistols at their sides, ready for whatever may come. 
‚ÄúWe‚Äôve building up for this, just like the Marines,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúWe are going to really train harder and try to increase our operational capabilities in the event that this is the day that we hoped would never come.‚Äù Share On:",1

Putin grants Steven Seagal Russian citizenship,"Putin grants Steven Seagal Russian citizenship 11/03/2016 
DAILY MAIL President Vladimir Putin signed off Thursday on a decree granting Russian citizenship to American action hero actor Steven Seagal, the latest high-profile passport handout to a Western celebrity. Hollywood star Seagal and judo-loving Kremlin tough guy Putin have struck up a bromance in recent years, with Seagal visiting Russia repeatedly and defending Moscow‚Äôs 2014 annexation of Crimea from Ukraine. ‚ÄòHe was asking quite insistently and over a lengthy period to be granted citizenship,‚Äô Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told journalists. ‚ÄòHe is well known for his warm feelings towards our country and has never hidden them.‚Äô DUAL CITIZENSHIP IN THE U.S. Americans are allowed to hold dual citizenship, such as Steven Seagal now has with Russia. U.S. law does not mention dual nationality not does it require its citizens to choose one nationality over the other. People that become U.S. citizens are asked to make a pledge of loyalty to the U.S., renouncing all previous allegiances, but the statement is more symbolic than contractual. However, there are rare cases in which a U.S. citizen can forfeit their citizenship by becoming the citizen of another nation. That can happen in instances when an American citizen joins the armed forces of a foreign nation or they make a declaration of allegiance to a foreign state with the express purpose of relinquishing their U.S. nationality. Seagal is the latest in a string of high-profile Westerners to be granted Russian citizenship after buddying up with Putin. Veteran French actor Gerard Depardieu was given a Russian passport in 2013 after the star became a tax exile in ire over rate hikes in his native country. Putin has also handed out citizenship to American boxer Roy Jones Jr after sipping tea with him in Crimea and to American mixed martial artist Jeff Monson. Seagal‚Äôs fame peaked in the late 1980s and early 1990s with films such as ‚ÄòUnder Siege‚Äô and ‚ÄòAbove the Law‚Äô, but he remains hugely popular in eastern Europe and was granted Serbian citizenship in January. Like Depardieu, he has previously hung out with Putin, a fellow martial arts fan, and other strongmen leaders from the former Soviet Union. After Russia‚Äôs annexation of Crimea, Seagal called Putin ‚Äòone of the great living world leaders‚Äô and even performed with his blues band in the annexed Black Sea peninsula. In August, veteran Belarussian leader Alexander Lukashenko made Seagal eat one of his homegrown carrots in an awkward encounter that drew mockery online.",1
New bionic eye implant connects directly to brain,"New bionic eye implant connects directly to brain 11/03/2016 
RUSSIA TODAY Scientists may have made a significant breakthrough in restoring human sight, as a woman who had been blind for seven years has regained the ability to see shapes and colours with a bionic eye implant. 
The 30-year-old woman had a wireless visual stimulator chip inserted into her brain by University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA) surgeons in the first human test of the product. As a result, she could see colored flashes, lines, and spots when signals were sent to her brain from a computer. 
The woman, who wished to remain anonymous, suffered no significant adverse side effects in the process, according to a statement. 
The device, which was developed as part of the Orion 1 programme by Second Sight, uses technology to restore sight by bypassing the optic nerve to stimulate the brain‚Äôs visual cortex, according to chairman Robert Greenberg. 
It is designed for those who cannot benefit from the Argus II retinal system that was unveiled at Manchester Royal Eye Hospital last year, but has limited application, as it depends on the patient having some retinal cells. 
This new system goes one step further by sending signals directly to the brain. It has the potential to restore sight to those who have gone completely blind for virtually any reason, including glaucoma, cancer, diabetic retinopathy, or trauma, according to the manufacturer. 
The next step is to connect the implant to a camera on a pair of glasses, and the company plans to seek FDA approval in 2017 to get the go ahead to conduct these trials. 
UCLA neurosurgeon Nader Pouratian, who implanted the stimulator, said the results of the surgery are promising. 
‚ÄúBased on these results, stimulation of the visual cortex has the potential to restore useful vision to the blind, which is important for independence and improving quality of life,‚Äù he said.",1
American Express disowns Pink Floyd singer Roger Waters because of pro-Palestinian views,"American Express disowns Pink Floyd singer Roger Waters because of pro-Palestinian views 11/03/2016 
MONDOWEISS When it comes to aiding Israeli Apartheid, American Express is just another brick in The Wall, according to a new report. Roger Waters, lead singer behind Pink Floyd, lost a multimillion dollar American Express sponsorship for his 2017 US+Them tour after expressing solidarity this month with Palestinian students trying to end Israel‚Äôs apartheid system of military occupation using the same protest tactic that helped dismantle South African Apartheid (and, earlier, America‚Äôs Jim Crow): Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions, or BDS. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm going to send out all of my most heartfelt love and support to all those young people on the campuses of the universities of California who are standing up for their brothers and sisters in Palestine and supporting the BDS movement,‚Äù Rogers said, according to CBS News , ‚Äúin the hope that we may encourage the government of Israel to end the occupation.‚Äù American Express decided it would be a good idea to leak the cancellation of the contract to the New York Post , where Page Six‚Äôs Emily Smith has the exclusive story . ‚ÄúRoger is putting on a huge show. The company was asked to sponsor his tour for $4 million, but pulled out because it did not want to be part of his anti-Israel rhetoric,‚Äù an American Express spokesman told the paper. ‚ÄúWe never committed to sponsoring Roger Waters‚Äô upcoming tour. When we were approached with the options, we passed on making a bid.‚Äù American Express had helped sponsor Waters‚Äô Oldchella Desert Trip festival (Coachella for the senior set featuring Neil Young, Bob Dylan, Paul McCartney, and the Rolling Stones) where he made the comments expressing support for human rights. But without anybody even asking them, American Express decided it had to go out of its way to bash Waters for ‚Äúputting on a huge show.‚Äù Noteworthy about American Express‚Äôs decision is that it comes even as Waters included more mainstream political views, like featuring in the performance a line of children wearing shirts that said ‚ÄúDerriba el muro,‚Äù (Tear down the wall). He also showed Trump in a Klan outfit, and the show featured a floating pig balloon that calls the Republican candidate an ‚ÄúIgnorant, lying, racist, sexist pig,‚Äù CBS reported. Waters more mainstream kinds of leftist protest didn‚Äôt make up for his audacious display of solidarity with his fellow human beings living and dying under a ceaseless occupation. American Express has also sponsored Beyonce‚Äôs performances, where she has used art to make reference to police oppression of communities of color . But AmEx lost its nerve when Waters brought up Palestinian rights. According to the New York Post , Waters has known that there are consequences for standing up against the occupation, and that keeps others silent. ‚ÄúI have been accused of being a Nazi and an anti-Semite for the past 10 years. My industry has been particularly recalcitrant in even raising a voice [against Israel] . . . I‚Äôve talked to a lot of them, and they are scared s ‚Äì ‚Äì tless. If they say something in public, they will no longer have a career. They will be destroyed,‚Äù he said, according to the Post. But Waters is already famous, and 75, so the stakes aren‚Äôt the same as for young artists. Update (11/1/16) This article originally quoted the New York Post as saying that Citi had assumed sponsorship of the tour after American Express dropped out, but after publication a representative of Citi contacted us with this clarification: In your article ‚Äú American Express disowns Pink Floyd singer Roger Waters because of pro-Palestinian views ‚Äù, it mentions that ‚ÄúCitibank grabbed the opportunity to sponsor one of the biggest and best acts of the 20th century.‚Äù However, Citi is not a sponsor of Roger Waters‚Äô upcoming tour. Two weeks ago, Citi offered a limited time pre-sale of tickets for cardmembers for select shows, as we do for thousands of concerts by different artists every year. The pre-sale has ended and we have no plans to work with this artist in the future.

Police fire rubber bullets at pipeline protesters,"Police fire rubber bullets at pipeline protesters 11/03/2016 
KGW 
Police in riot gear shot rubber bullets and used pepper spray on demonstrators ‚Äî who call themselves water protectors ‚Äî on the shoreline of the Cantapeta Creek, just north of the Standing Rock Sioux Indian Reservation on Wednesday. 
After a few relatively peaceful days at the campground, where thousands have gathered to demonstrate against a controversial North Dakota oil pipeline, demonstrators put out calls on social media to ‚Äúmake your way to the river‚Äù for a ‚Äúriver action,‚Äù but to do so ‚Äúin prayer.‚Äù 
In a Facebook Live stream, Cempoalli Twenny , who says he is at Standing Rock to protect the water, said, ‚ÄúThe pipeline is getting really close to the river now, so it‚Äôs crunch time.‚Äù 
Demonstrators on the shoreline prayed, played drums, sang, and waded into the river towards the base of the hill where armed police stood. 
It was a ‚Äú100 percent peaceful protest,‚Äù according to activist Erin Schrode, who was shot in the lower back with a rubber bullet while standing on the shoreline opposite police. Schrode had joined others from the camp in solidarity as they prayed on the shoreline. 
A confrontation erupted after law enforcement dismantled a wooden bridge that demonstrators constructed to access the sacred site. 
‚ÄúI was shot in point blank range,‚Äù said Schrode, who says she is shaken but physically will recover. ‚ÄúAnother water protector was also shot at twice at point blank range, but the rubber bullet hit the water, and not him.‚Äù 
In a press release, the Morton County Sheriff‚Äôs Department said it used ‚Äúless-than-lethal ammunition to control the situation‚Äù when a man threw bottles at officers on the police line and when another charged the police line. ‚ÄúOfficers also deployed pepper spray and tear gas to disperse the group of protesters who came across the water and camp at officers,‚Äù the release said. 
Even as law enforcement warned protesters to leave the area and return to their camp, demonstrators could be heard yelling back at police. 
‚ÄúThere was absolutely no provocation of any kind,‚Äù said film director Josh Fox, who was also on scene. ‚ÄúThe police pepper sprayed people sitting in the water.‚Äù 
Law enforcement vehicles and personnel have been stationed on a hill overlooking the shoreline in question for a number of days, and the hill is recognized as a burial ground and sacred site by the Standing Rock Sioux. 
On Monday, people who identified themselves as water protectors waded across the creek to the hill to request that law enforcement move off the sacred area. 
According to the Morton County Sheriff‚Äôs Department public information officer, the police remained there ‚Äúto prevent criminal trespass on private property.‚Äù 
Wednesday, the Department said The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers gave Morton County orders to remove a wooden pedestrian bridge that had been constructed across the river and arrest any individuals who cross the river for criminal trespass. 
‚ÄúI was facing the line of officers from across the river and all of a sudden, I felt as if someone swung a mallet with all their might against my lower back. It obliterated me,‚Äù said Schrode. ‚ÄúI turned around and I had no idea what just happened. And there was an officer pointing his gun in my direction from a boat.‚Äù 
Morton County called the situation a ‚Äústandoff‚Äù and, in a press release, stated that ‚Äúprotesters involved in this activity are violating numerous federal and state laws.‚Äù 
E‚Äôsha Hoferer , who is a member of the Walker River Paiute Tribe and who says he is in Standing Rock to protect the water for his children and grandchildren, told NBC News before Wednesday‚Äôs encounter with law enforcement that the construction of the pipeline is ‚Äúdesecrating a lot of sacred sites‚Äù and that ‚Äúa lot of the traditional ecological knowledge that we have ‚Äì that Standing Rock has ‚Äì shows that we have ceremonial sites up there, sacred sites, burial sites,‚Äù referring to the hill at the center of the standoff. 
The last big clash between police and demonstrators took place on Thursday, October 27, when 141 protesters were arrested .",1

EPOCH TIMES 
The FBI investigation into the Clinton Foundation is likely to lead to an indictment, sources with the federal law enforcement agency said. 
Those sources said that the probe into the Clinton Foundation is being taken as a ‚Äúvery high priority,‚Äù reported Fox News on Wednesday evening. The news outlet described them as ‚Äúseparate sources‚Äù within the agency. 
Agents have interviewed several people involved in the foundation case, looking for possible pay-to-play links between then-secretary of state Hillary Clinton and the Clinton Foundation. The White Collar Crime division of the FBI is conducting the investigation. 
‚ÄúThere is an avalanche of new information coming in every day,‚Äù a source told Fox News. 
Sources, meanwhile, told Fox that FBI agents collected a significant amount of evidence even before WikiLeaks started releasing emails linked to the Democratic National Committee and the Clinton campaign. 
As FBI agents are ‚Äúactively and aggressively pursuing this case,‚Äù they‚Äôll interview the same people again‚Äîpossibly some for a third time, the report stated. They‚Äôll also look into what Hillary Clinton and her aides told them in previous interviews. 
While on the air, Fox News reporter Bret Baier, citing unnamed sources, said that Clinton‚Äôs private email server has been breached by at least five separate foreign intelligence hackers. 
‚ÄúI pressed again and again on this very issue, and these sources said, ‚ÄòYes, the investigations will continue‚Äô‚Äù if Clinton defeats rival Donald Trump on Election Day, Baier said on Fox News. 
‚ÄúAnd barring some obstruction in some way, they believe they‚Äôll continue to likely an indictment,‚Äù Baier added .",1
Assad: US waging proxy war in Syria against Russia & Iran,"Assad: US waging proxy war in Syria against Russia & Iran 11/03/2016 
BLACKLISTEDNEWS.COM Despite claiming humanitarian motives, US actions in Syria are meant to undermine the power of Russia and Iran, with Washington trying to achieve this goal by directly supporting terrorists, Syrian President Bashar Assad has said. The US‚Äô secret collaboration with terrorists is the reason why all attempts at a ceasefire and political transition in Syria have so far failed, the Syrian leader told Serbian newspaper Politika. The interview was also published by the Syria‚Äôs SANA news agency.
‚ÄúSupporting the terrorists is a war of attrition against Syria, against Iran, against Russia, that‚Äôs how they look at it. That‚Äôs why not only this ceasefire ‚Äì every attempt regarding ceasefire or political moving or political initiative, every failure of these things, the United States was to blame,‚Äù the Syrian president said. 
Assad was referring to the deal negotiated by the US and Russia in September, which it was hoped would pave the way for a lasting truce in Syria. In practice, the agreement was derailed by armed groups, which had rejected it from the very beginning. The US pledged to convince the so-called moderate opposition to stick to the bargain and separate from terrorists, who would then be legitimate targets for a joint Russian-American air campaign. Washington didn‚Äôt deliver on this promise, however. 
According to the Syrian president, a lasting ceasefire was not what Washington sought from the deal in the first place. 
‚ÄúThey always ask for ceasefire only when the terrorists are in a bad situation, not for the civilians. And they try to use those ceasefires in order to support the terrorists, bring them logistic support, armament, money, everything, in order to re-attack and to become stronger again,‚Äù he said. 
Sometimes the US support for terrorist groups goes through its allies such as Turkey, Saudi Arabia and Qatar, Assad believes, while occasionally they provide direct support even to Islamic State (IS, formerly ISIS/ISIL), a group that the Washington-led coalition was supposedly formed to defeat. An example of this came during an American attack on Syrian Army troops near Deir Ez-Zor, which happened while the US-Russian truce was in force, and which the US claimed was the result of a mistake. 
‚ÄúThey attacked a very big area. They didn‚Äôt attack a building to say, ‚Äòwe made a mistake.‚Äô They attacked three big hills, not other groups neighboring these hills,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúIn less than one hour, ISIS attacked those hills. It means that ISIS gathered their forces to attack those hills. How did ISIS know that the Americans would attack that Syrian position? It means they were ready, they were prepared.‚Äù 
Humanitarian mask, like in Yugoslavia, Afghanistan or Iraq Western media are currently focusing on civilian suffering in Syria and alleged atrocities committed by the Syrian government and its allies to justify deeper involvement in the war by whatever means the White House chooses, Assad said in the interview. 
‚ÄúYou have a black-and-white picture; very, very bad guy against very, very good guy. It‚Äôs like the narrative of George W. Bush during the war on Iraq and on Afghanistan,‚Äù he described. 
‚ÄúThe war in your country has been portrayed in the same way; as a humanitarian war where the West wanted to intervene in order to protect a certain community against the aggressors from the other community,‚Äù Assad said, referring to the Balkan Wars and the partitioning of Yugoslavia. ‚ÄúSo, many people in the world believe that story, the same in Syria; they use the same mask, the humanitarian mask.‚Äù 
While stressing any wrongdoing on the part of the government forces, the West ignores whatever atrocities the opposition commits, the president said. 
‚ÄúThe terrorists killed during the last three days more than 80 innocent civilians in Aleppo, and wounded more than 300. You don‚Äôt read anything about them in the Western mainstream media,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúThey only single out some pictures and some incidents in the area under the control of the terrorists just to use them for their political agenda in order to condemn and to blame the Syrian government, not because they are worried about the Syrians.‚Äù 
‚ÄúThey don‚Äôt care about our children, or about innocents, and about civilization, about infrastructure,‚Äù he added. ‚ÄúBut actually, they only care about using everything that would serve their vested interests.‚Äù 
The Syrian president doesn‚Äôt expect the US approach to Syria to change, regardless of who wins the presidential election next week, he told the newspaper. Both Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump would be bad for his country, he said. 
‚ÄúWe don‚Äôt see any good signs that the United States is going to change dramatically its policy toward what‚Äôs happening in the world‚Ä¶ or to obey the international law, or to care about the United Nation‚Äôs Charter,‚Äù he said. 
‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not about who‚Äôs going to be president; the difference will be very minimal, each one of them is going to be allowed to leave his own fingerprint, just personal fingerprint, but doesn‚Äôt mean change of policies. That‚Äôs why we don‚Äôt pin our hopes, we don‚Äôt waste our time with it.‚Äù 
A year without interference to stop war Assad reiterated his assessment that if Syria were left to settle its problems without foreign interference, it would take it no more than a year to end the conflict, saying that ‚Äúit is not very complicated internally.‚Äù 
‚ÄúOf course, that looks not realistic, because everybody knows that the United States wanted to undermine the position of Russia as a great power in the world, including in Syria. Saudi Arabia has been looking how to destroy Iran for years now, and Syria could be one of the places where they can achieve that, according to their way of thinking,‚Äù he said. 
‚ÄúBut if we say that we could achieve that situation where all those foreign powers leave Syria alone, we don‚Äôt have a problem in solving our problem.‚Äù 
The president said Syria has existed as a multiethnic multiconfessional entity for centuries and has significant experience in overcoming differences. 
‚ÄúWithout all different colors of the society ‚Äì Christians, Muslims, and the different sects and ethnicities ‚Äì you won‚Äôt have Syria. So, every Syrian citizen should feel fully free in practicing his rituals, his traditions, his beliefs. He should be free in order to have a stable country. Otherwise you won‚Äôt have Syria as a stable country,‚Äù Assad said. 
The war has been a huge ordeal for Syrian society, but it has made Syrians as a nation more united, not less, he added. 
‚ÄúMany Syrians before the war didn‚Äôt tell the difference between being fanatic and being extremist, between being extremist and being terrorist. Those borders weren‚Äôt clear for many,‚Äù the president said. ‚ÄúBecause of the war, because of the destruction, because of the heavy price that affected every Syrian, many Syrians learned the lesson and now they know that the only way to protect the country and to preserve the country is to be homogenous, to live with each other, to integrate, to accept, to love each other.‚Äù 
‚ÄúThat‚Äôs why I think the effect of the war, in spite of all the bad aspects of any war like this war, but this aspect was positive for the Syrian society. So, I‚Äôm not worried about the structure of Syrian society after the war. I think it‚Äôs going to be healthier,‚Äù Assad added.",1
November supermoon biggest in nearly 70 years,"November supermoon biggest in nearly 70 years 11/03/2016 
USA TODAY 
Supersized! November supermoon will be biggest in nearly 70 years. The supermoon occurs when the moon is slightly closer to Earth than it typically is, and the effect is most noticeable when it occurs around the same time as a full moon. 
It can appear 14% bigger and 30% brighter than usual, according to NASA. 
The word supermoon was coined in 1979 by astrologer Richard Nolle, AccuWeather‚Äôs Mark Paquette says. Nolle used the term to describe a new or full moon that occurs when the moon is at or near its closest approach to Earth. 
Instead of a supermoon, astronomy site Slooh.com is calling it a ‚Äúmega beaver moon,‚Äù which includes the moon‚Äôs folklore name for November. 
According to the Old Farmer‚Äôs Almanac , the November moon was named the beaver moon partly because, ‚Äúfor both the colonists and the Algonquin tribes, this was the time to set beaver traps before the swamps froze, to ensure a supply of warm winter furs.‚Äù

RT crew comes under fire as Aleppo militants launch massive new assault (VIDEO),"RT crew comes under fire as Aleppo militants launch massive new assault (VIDEO) 11/03/2016 
RUSSIA TODAY RT‚Äôs Murad Gazdiev and his crew came under fire in Aleppo as militant groups holding the eastern part of the city launched a new assault on government-held western areas, trying to break the blockade, after rejecting an offer to leave the city with their arms. 
The neighborhood ‚Äú has been relatively quiet for the past two days and we wanted to see what was happening there ,‚Äù RT‚Äôs Gazdiev reported from Aleppo. ‚Äú There are still dozens of civilians there, not everyone managed to leave. ‚Äù 
The rebels apparently launched a major new offensive against the government-held part of the city, radio communications intercepted by the Syrian military indicate. 
‚Äú There were apparently two or three suicide car bombs blown up very close to us. We hid. We saw many shells landing meters away from us, ‚Äù Gazdiev said. 
The Syrian Army helped the RT crew along with civilians being evacuated from the area. 
Earlier on Wednesday, the Russian military said that last week‚Äôs attempts by the militants to break through the blockade around the city had failed, and suggested that they leave Aleppo through one of two corridors opened for that purpose. 
Russia and Syria halted airstrikes on eastern Aleppo two weeks ago amid a flurry of criticism from the West over civilian casualties in the city. Moscow said civilians were being held by the militants as human shields, but agreed to keep warplanes away from the city. 
The offer to leave Aleppo by Friday night was rejected by some groups controlling the eastern part of the city. 
Russia‚Äôs earlier attempts to allow militants to leave and civilians to be evacuated from eastern Aleppo were thwarted by the more belligerent groups, which opened fire at anyone trying to use the corridors ‚Äì both those meant for armed people and unarmed civilians.",1
US-led airstrike kills at least 30 Afghan civilians,"US-led airstrike kills at least 30 Afghan civilians 11/03/2016 
PRESS TV 
At least 30 Afghan civilians, including women and children, have lost their lives in Afghanistan in an airstrike carried out by the so-called US-led military alliance in the country‚Äôs volatile north. 
Local Afghan officials said more than two dozen civilians were also injured in the aerial assault which took place in the northern province of Kunduz on Thursday. 
‚ÄúAfghan forces and coalition troops conducted a joint operation against the Taliban insurgents. In the bombardment, 30 Afghan civilians were martyred and 25 others were wounded,‚Äù media outlets quoted provincial spokesman, Mahmood Danish, as saying. 
Airstrike sparks anti-US protest rally 
Following the deadly airstrike, dozens of the relatives of those killed in the US-led raid staged a demonstration outside the governor‚Äôs office in Kunduz to condemn the attack as they were carrying the bodies of the victims. 
‚ÄúI am heartbroken. I have lost seven members of my family. I want to know, why these innocent children were killed? Were they Taliban?‚Äù said Taza Gul, a 55-year-old laborer, adding, ‚ÄúNo, they were innocent children.‚Äù

Taliban militants briefly overran the city of Kunduz, the provincial capital with the same name, in early October. They had briefly seized control of the city a year earlier but they were pushed out of Kunduz weeks later. They now seek to gain full control over the city. 
Taliban militants were removed from power following the 2001 US-led invasion of Afghanistan, but they have stepped up their activities in recent months, attempting to overrun several provinces. 
Afghan forces have been engaged in fierce clashes with Taliban to contain the ongoing insurgency across various parts of the violence-wrecked country. 
The rising violence in Afghanistan comes despite the presence of thousands of foreign troops in the country.",1
"Protesters, Police Still Clashing Over Disputed North Dakota Pipeline","Protesters, Police Still Clashing Over Disputed North Dakota Pipeline 11/03/2016 
NPR 
Police used pepper spray and what they called nonlethal ammunition to remove Dakota Access Pipeline protesters from federal land Wednesday. Demonstrators say they were trying to occupy land just north of the Standing Rock Sioux Reservation where construction of the controversial pipeline is scheduled. 
This was the first significant clash between law enforcement and protesters since demonstrations turned violent last week and more than 100 people were arrested. 
According to the Morton County, N.D., Sheriff‚Äôs Department, a group of people began building a wood pedestrian bridge across a creek north of the main protest camp early Wednesday morning. The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers owns the land and had asked law enforcement to remove any protesters who try to reach it. 
Officers in boats pulled the makeshift bridge apart and warned protesters they would be arrested if they continued to trespass. After a several-hour standoff with police, protesters dispersed and returned to their main camp. 
During the standoff, a few protesters watched from across the nearby Cannonball River. They waded into the water ‚Äî some chest-deep ‚Äî to shout support for colleagues closer to officers. 
‚ÄúI decided to get into the river and just be a presence there,‚Äù says Stephanie Jasper of Tampa Bay, Fla. She watched as law enforcement pushed protesters back toward the main camp, and says she saw officers use pepper spray. She says it was a chaotic sight as a police helicopter hovered overhead. 
Several protesters standing in the river held mirrors directed at law enforcement officers lined up on the other side and at police on the river in boats. 
‚ÄúEverybody was just sharing love to these officers and explaining why it is we‚Äôre here and questioning why they were,‚Äù says Jasper. 
One law enforcement official had a very different view of the protest. ‚ÄúIn my 27 years in law enforcement, I have never seen such an absolute disregard for the law or other people‚Äôs rights because of someone else‚Äôs ideology,‚Äù said Cass County, N.D., Sheriff Paul Laney. 
The Standing Rock Sioux Tribe says the Dakota Access Pipeline construction route crosses land that is sacred to its members. And the tribe worries a pipeline spill could pollute local water. The tribe wants the federal government to stop work on the pipeline and conduct a full environmental impact study of the pipeline. 
The Morton County Sheriff‚Äôs Department says one person was arrested for ‚Äúconspiracy to commit obstruction of a government function.‚Äù In a press release, the agency says the protester was buying canoes and kayaks for others to cross the creek.",1

Juror explanation for Ammon Bundy verdict,"Juror explanation for Ammon Bundy verdict 11/03/2016 
OREGONLIVE 
Juror 4 has so far provided the only public explanation of the behind-the-scenes discussions that led to the acquittal of Ammon Bundy, his brother and five others on federal conspiracy charges stemming from the Malheur National Wildlife Refuge occupation. 
Readers have asked to hear more from him about the jury‚Äôs reasoning in reaching the surprising decision. 
Juror 4 ‚Äì a 44-year-old business administration student at Marylhurst University who served in the Navy during the Iraq War ‚Äì went into detail in a series of email exchanges with The Oregonian/OregonLive that were used in news stories. 
Here‚Äôs a transcript of the emails, with some minor editing for brevity or clarity. He‚Äôs asked not to be identified for fear of retribution. The judge sealed the names of all nine women and three men on the jury, citing public safety. 
Juror 4 makes references to U.S. District Judge Anna J. Brown; prosecutor Ethan Knight; Juror 11 who the judge removed from the jury after Juror 4 questioned his objectivity; Juror 18, who replaced Juror 11; and Ryan Payne, one of the leaders of the occupation with Ammon Bundy. 
He also references a Jan. 2 rally for Harney County ranchers and then the takeover of the refuge later that day. 
All seven defendants faced a charge of conspiring to impede employees of the U.S. Fish & Wildlife Service or U.S. Bureau of Land Management from doing their work through intimidation, threat or force during the 41-day occupation. 
His initial email: 
It should be known that all 12 jurors felt that this verdict was a statement regarding the various failures of the prosecution to prove ‚Äúconspiracy‚Äù in the count itself ‚Äì and not any form of affirmation of the defense‚Äôs various beliefs, actions, or aspirations. Proving the elements of conspiracy, especially given the body of evidence we were forced to restrict ourselves to consider when judging, was far too great a standard to meet (without using our imaginations, prejudices, etc.). 
The judge floored us when she said that there was no statute against impeding federal officers (by force, threat, or intimidation), nor was there a significant penalty applied to criminal trespass. We all queried about alternative charges that could stick and were amazed that this ‚Äòconspiracy‚Äô charge seemed the best possible option. It was not lost on us that our verdict(s) might inspire future actions that are regrettable, but that sort of thinking was not permitted when considering the charges before us. 
The prosecution asked us to neglect Judge Brown‚Äôs final (binding) instructions when they asserted in closing that adverse possession = conspiracy to impede (as per Mr. Knight‚Äôs closing argument), as if defining actions was all that was needed to convict. All 12 agreed that impeding existed, even if as an effect of the occupation, and that something was very wrong. But we were not asked to judge on bullets and hurt feelings, rather to decide if an agreement was made with an illegal object in mind. It seemed this basic, high standard of proof was lost upon the prosecution throughout. Inference, while possibly compelling, proved to be insulting or inadequate to 12 diversely situated people as a means to convict. The air of triumphalism that the prosecution brought was not lost on any of us, nor was it warranted given their burden of proof. 
Regarding my role in crafting the letter that led to the dismissal of juror 11, I can say that it was not only necessary but also borne out of much patience in dealing with a fellow who had zero business being on this jury in the first place. He effectively wasted a great deal of our time as he (irrationally) promoted his theory of conspiracy despite the absence of evidence. Also, he violated Judge Brown‚Äôs explicit orders by hearkening to ‚Äòevidence‚Äô that was never admitted in this case, refused to consider the defendant‚Äôs state of mind, and used imaginative theories to explain key actions. How this juror slipped through the cracks is mind boggling and very disconcerting. 
You should know that the sentiments expressed in that letter were the exact thoughts I had when juror 11 first made his opening remarks on day one of deliberations, but I resisted the impulse to send the question at that time and give this fellow the chance to convince/explain. It seemed wise to suspend my shock/disbelief in him until a thorough examination of his mindset was complete (and the other jurors could weigh in themselves on his various theories). The vast majority of time was spent trying to deal with his bizarre theories, compared against what was admitted and/or expected of us as standards of judgment. While I wish now that I had sent the letter on day one, since it would have alleviated much stress for all of us, I would wish to have the time/opportunity to expand or alter my perspective that we afforded him. 
As I peruse the responses of many interested parties in this case, many of which express ‚Äòprofound regret‚Äô over the verdicts, I am baffled by the flippant sentiments that seem to dominate the landscape. Several questions immediately percolate in my mind: do these folks even know what it took to arrive at a verdict on any one of these counts? How could 12 diverse people find such agreement unless there was a colossal failure on the part of the prosecution? Don‚Äôt they know that ‚Äònot guilty‚Äô does not mean ‚Äòinnocent‚Äô? I have many such thoughts swirling around in my head that I‚Äôd like to vent, but I need to break it off for now. 
*** 

We asked a series of follow-up questions : How did the jury feel about starting all over again? Did other jurors know about your note regarding Juror 11 ‚Äî and how did they react to it? How did the jury start anew? Why the substantially shorter time period for the final verdicts? 

Juror 4‚Äôs response: 
The feeling, at the time of the reset, was universal relief that we even had a chance to hear from a more objective juror. It was not a relief to think we could be there today (Friday ) or Monday, frankly, but all said they were more than willing to start over in order to erase the ill feelings created while deliberating with juror 11. We had no knowledge about juror 18‚Äôs leanings in any regard prior to her coming in (we maintained a strict standard to not discuss the case with each other before deliberating). 
Only juror #1 knew about my note (since he had to pass it on to the judge), or so I thought. Juror 11, when we later were arguing about his bias, said he knew what I must have been doing when I folded a note and quietly handed it to Juror 1. My note was a last resort, frankly, because I made the entire jury uneasy by directly challenging juror 11 (on Tuesday morning; more than 16 hours of deliberations had passed) about his stated bias. Many jurors were upset at my direct approach and seemingly personal challenge to him. What I had said to him was far more upsetting than the contents of my note, and so I don‚Äôt think the jurors should have been surprised. Of course, I didn‚Äôt openly state to the jury that I had an open question before the court until the next morning (Wednesday) when juror 11 played the victim. I again reiterated that this whole issue was of his own making, and although he calmly explained what his bias was or meant to him in this case, I was anxious to hear from the court. 
It is a fact that we were so exhausted by this time that we nearly submitted final ballots on Wednesday, with juror 11‚Äôs input (equaling a mistrial on most counts). It is also true that I told the jury that if I did not get an answer to my question from the court, I would be forced to take my grievance to the media immediately afterwards. We had no idea of what had transpired in court as a result of my question, but you begin to feel neglected after almost 24 hours of silence. 
All of the other 10 jurors were relieved that juror 11 was excused, and most of them personally thanked me for doing what I did (even though I upset them in the process). 
Starting anew was filled with trepidation by the remaining 11 jurors, because we didn‚Äôt want to allow any whiff of prior deliberations to influence our new juror. This was all about her, frankly. We let her purge her feelings, as we all had the opportunity to do, and we let her direct the review of evidence. To her credit, she was fairly focused on getting her thoughts communicated quickly and purposefully so that time was not lost. The rapidity of her pace caused us to caution her, slow her a bit, but she was very business-like. It was clear that by 11:00 a.m., our new juror had resolved any questions regarding counts 1 and 2. She was relieved, and perhaps a bit surprised, that there was unanimity on these points. 
While we had a robust process for counts 4 and 5, we had reached a point of impasse by 2:00. There were no throw away words expressed on this day. The extremes we felt pressed into really crystallized our purpose, even if we had to go through the essential elements again, and it made for a swift process. 
Before we sent our final word to the court, I asked our new juror if she could explain why this process was so fast, to which she replied confidently and affirmatively. She‚Äôs a sharp lady and can handle herself, I think. 

Q. Wondered if there were turning points or particular moments in the trial that stuck out for jurors in helping the jury reach the not guilty pleas. 
A. Turning points? Let me begin by speaking for myself before I attempt to recall those of others. I expected there to be a witness to the January 2nd meeting at Ye Olde Castle before the protest/rally that would confirm the prosecution‚Äôs assertion of intent to impede, and the absence of such evidence became a seed of doubt that grew. I expected that there must be proof of conspiracy between Ammon and Ryan Payne (most logical link, owing to their initial visit to the Hammond‚Äôs place in early November) but he wasn‚Äôt even called for either side, nor were there any phone calls, emails, etc. that would demonstrate agreement here. These two major holes in the evidence record proved to cause insurmountable doubt for me. 
Others said that, while the evidence record was not adequate, certain moments turned them. One said they did a full 180 degree turn when they realized there were six informants that went unnamed on the refuge during the occupation, and the choice of the prosecution to allow that much room for mysterious influence there (remember Fabio?) was decisive. One said that the doctrine of adverse possession seemed to govern every thought, word, and deed of the ‚Äòleadership‚Äô such that it could not be deemed intent to impede federal workers. Another said that the repeated objections to the reading of the constitution became a wedge issue for them. Those turning points are the most distinct ones I can remember, and so I‚Äôll leave it there. 
Q. What about counts 4 and 5? What was the thinking with those? (Count 4 was a property theft charge against defendant Kennth Medenbach for driving a refuge truck to the Safeway in Burns and Count 5 was a property theft charge against Ryan Bundy for helping to remove FBI surveillance cameras from two utility poles near the refuge.) 

A. With count four, we were split for a good while and it didn‚Äôt look like we could agree. Because this law requires us to consider intent, one of the jurors pressed hard on the issue of what Medenbach was thinking (adverse possession: he believed it was no longer a refuge truck). The video/audio evidence of his arrest was instructive, confirming a mindset. Some jurors were impressed by the surprise Medenbach expressed to the state police officer when told that the rig was reported as stolen. Another said if he had been caught with it while not doing ‚Äòresource center‚Äô business, so to speak, then it would have demonstrated his intent was not consistent with the claim. Eventually, none of us could imagine he was not going to return the vehicle to the refuge. 
Count five plagued us most of the day. We had to table the discussion a couple times because the contentions over the wording of the law as it relates to ‚Äòknowingly stole‚Äô proved to be a major hang up for one juror. There were many different definitions of ‚Äòstole‚Äô at play in the minds of several jurors. In the morning, 11 out of 12 were prepared to vote guilty, but after simmering and revisiting the debate a few times, the number of votes for not guilty grew to three. A couple of jurors came to believe that having the media present, offering back the cameras to the F.B.I., and taking steps to safeguard them after removal was proof of something other than theft. The majority could not deny that the intent to deprive was clearly present in Ryan. Since we were moving the opposite way of consensus and three jurors were resolved to vote not guilty, we agreed to end deliberations. 
Q. What did you and others think of Ammon Bundy‚Äôs testimony? 
A. It was clear that there was no juror who received Ammon‚Äôs testimony as fully honest, and several who felt manipulated. Even those who felt he was sincere in his beliefs found examples of inconsistency in his testimony. 
The continual objections to Ammon‚Äôs answers (usually owing to his own misleading phrasing that was disallowed) became tedious to myself, especially since altering one word would make the answer acceptable (and often did). The emotional appeals riddled throughout, while understandable as a tactic, also became tiresome to me since our feelings as jurors are irrelevant after all. And I don‚Äôt think it was endearing to us jurors for him to characterize the entire federal court system, of which we were a key part of, as rigged against himself. 
A few outstanding things Ammon testified to stood out to me. There apparently were multiple attempts to meet personally with the F.B.I. by Ammon and yet no face-to-face meet up ever occurred, presumably because the bureau did not wish to have that sort of negotiation. And the lack of law enforcement/engagement throughout the occupation, coupled with the visits to the refuge by many politicians, caused me to see how occupiers could view their presence as something other than illegal. Also, after watching an edited version of KATU‚Äôs Steve Dunn interview with Ammon at the refuge (this was played for the jury by Ammon Bundy‚Äôs lawyer ), there seemed to be consistency of message/belief that I did not expect ‚Äî especially if you have 9 months to ponder your defense, even I might alter my emphasis or eliminate something unfavorable. Because of the law‚Äôs wording, Ammon‚Äôs state of mind weighed heavily. 

Q. Why do you wish to remain anonymous? 
A: Because I‚Äôd rather not encounter any of the angry commenters on your articles, I prefer to remain simply as Juror 4. I read on twitter that Matt Schindler (one of the defense attorneys) is receiving threats, which is very troubling to me.

Doug Casey: A Civil War Could Be in the Cards After the Election,"Doug Casey: A Civil War Could Be in the Cards After the Election 11/03/2016 
LEW ROCKWELL 
( Source: The 2nd American Civil War by Richard Hubal, via MN Artists ) 
Nick Giambruno: The US presidential election is only days away. What are the country‚Äôs greatest problems right now? 
Doug Casey: Domestically, I‚Äôd say the continual and accelerating loss of freedom, compounded by the prospect of what I suspect will be the biggest financial/economic crisis of modern times. What might that crisis be like? That‚Äôs unpredictable, although the odds are it will be unlike any others that are still fresh in people‚Äôs memories, simply because people tend to be most prepared for the things that have most recently scared them. The big problems usually come from an unexpected quarter, and/or at an unexpected time. Like the monetary crisis of 1998, that materialized in Thailand. 
That said, the question remains of where to look. It could come from outside American borders, in the form of war. War is perhaps the worst thing that can happen, not only for the destruction it will cause in itself, but because it will immensely exacerbate America‚Äôs domestic problems. As Bourne famously said, ‚ÄúWar is the health of the State.‚Äù Certainly, the US government is actively provoking other governments in a score of places around the world. The next war could be serious, not just a sports war, like those in Iraq and Afghanistan. 
Nick Giambruno: In 2000, the federal government‚Äôs debt was just over $5 trillion. Now, it‚Äôs about $20 trillion. It doesn‚Äôt matter who‚Äôs in power. The debt continues to grow exponentially. Unless the government makes radical cuts to welfare and the military‚Äîwhich won‚Äôt happen no matter who is elected‚Äîit will grow indefinitely. 
If Americans are destined to be indebted serfs no matter who‚Äôs in power, do the elections even matter? 
Doug Casey: If the economy goes off of the deep end over the next year‚Äîand I think it will‚Äîthe US government is going to be running much bigger deficits. Spending is going to go up for welfare. Medicare, Medicaid, Social Security‚Äîthat‚Äôs already about two-thirds of the US government‚Äôs budget. Military spending is also going up. All that is going to go up, regardless of who wins the election on November 8. 
We could easily see a trillion dollar deficit, perhaps much more. Now, where are they going to get all that money? The Chinese aren‚Äôt going to lend it to the US anymore. They‚Äôre basically going to finance the deficit by selling the debt to the Federal Reserve. And that means creating more currency units out of thin air. 
But, on the other hand, the average guy‚Äîand for that matter, most businesses‚Äîaren‚Äôt borrowing money now. They‚Äôre too afraid. They don‚Äôt want to be in debt. The question is: As this comes to a real climax, are we going to have something resembling a runaway inflation in the dollar? Or are we going to have a massive credit collapse, which could be caused by defaults on bonds, house mortgages, student loans, or auto loans? I‚Äôm not sure which is going to happen. I mean, you buy a car now in the US, it costs you what a house did a couple generations ago. It all floats on a sea of debt. I‚Äôm just betting on financial chaos. That is the safe bet. 
No matter which way this election goes, it‚Äôs going to be ugly. 
Both candidates, Trump and Clinton, are disastrous. To me, it‚Äôs a sign of how degraded the US has become. About a year ago, they gave us a choice between Hillary, the wife of a previous president, pretty much playing the role of Argentina‚Äôs Evita, Juan Peron‚Äôs brassy wife. And Jeb Bush, the brother of one previous president and the son of another. The US has gone so far downhill that we can only choose which family dynasty we prefer to rule. If only a Kennedy, a Roosevelt, or a Rockefeller could be thrown into the mix as well‚Ä¶ Maybe next time. Although I think we‚Äôre due for a general or two. 
Elections are, quite frankly, meaningless. These two corrupt parties, the Republicrats, and the Demopublicans, run by political hacks and funded by interest groups, simply appoint the people that they want and then present the American people with the illusion of a choice. The people who run these parties have become increasingly bold and arrogant. They‚Äôre absolutely horrible creatures, the same types that used to thrive in the Soviet Union. Americans should be ashamed of themselves for treating them with any respect at all. 
However, if forced to choose between the two candidates, I would definitely go for Trump, simply because he‚Äôs something of an outsider. The media, Hollywood, academia, and the Establishment hate him. And I believe he hates them. If elected, he will likely overturn a lot of apple carts in Washington and break a lot of rice bowls of people who live off the Deep State. That would be an excellent thing. It‚Äôs also possible he would retract most of Obama‚Äôs Executive Orders, and fire a bunch of supernumeraries. But he might replace them with a bunch of his own. 
However, it‚Äôs clear Trump has all kinds of dangerous authoritarian tendencies‚Äîdon‚Äôt forget his endorsement of torture and the killing of families of accused terrorists as a policy. He also has all kinds of really silly and destructive economic notions‚Äîhe appears to think he can cut ‚Äúdeals‚Äù with foreign governments. That has nothing to do with the concept of free trade. He‚Äôs threatened punitive tariffs, something that would immensely aggravate The Greater Depression. Worse, since as a businessman he‚Äôs associated with the free market‚Äîunfortunately, and incorrectly‚Äîcapitalism will wind up being blamed for this depression as well as a result. 
Incidentally, I believe‚Äîas I have for over a year‚Äîthat Trump is going to win. Why? It‚Äôs not just the immense enthusiasm of his supporters, as opposed to the lukewarm support that Hillary gets. It‚Äôs that Bernie Sanders was the other ‚Äúprotest‚Äù candidate in this election. His numerous and enthusiastic supporters believe‚Äîcorrectly‚Äîthat Hillary and the Democratic machine stole the nomination from him. They‚Äôre genuinely pissed off. I believe only the most oblivious ones will vote for Hillary. A few might be mad enough to want to burn the house down by voting for Trump. 
I haven‚Äôt heard anyone talking about the absence of the Bernie-istas. I don‚Äôt keep my finger on the pulse of the hoi polloi . But, if I‚Äôm right, it will result in a landslide for Trump. 
Unfortunately, Trump is no libertarian‚Äîbut neither is the dim-bulb candidate of the Libertarian Party. That said Trump is a lot better than Hillary‚Äîthis is no time for a corrupt, hostile, elderly, debilitated, mildly demented Statist to become president. So, sure, I‚Äôd prefer Trump. 
Am I going to vote for him? I don‚Äôt believe in being complicit in a criminal act, so I don‚Äôt vote. 
Nick Giambruno: Please elaborate‚Ä¶ 
Doug Casey: There are at least five reasons not to vote: Voting in a political election is unethical. The political process is one of institutionalized coercion and force. If you disapprove of those things, then you shouldn‚Äôt participate in them, even indirectly. Voting compromises your privacy. It gets your name in yet another government computer database. Voting, as well as registering, entails hanging around government offices and dealing with petty bureaucrats. Most people can find something more enjoyable or productive to do with their time. Voting encourages politicians. A vote against one candidate‚Äîa major, and quite understandable, the reason why most people vote‚Äîis always interpreted as a vote for his opponent. And even though you may be voting for the lesser of two evils, the lesser of two evils is still evil. It amounts to giving the candidate a tacit mandate to impose his will on society. Your vote doesn‚Äôt count. Politicians like to say it counts because it is to their advantage to get everyone into a busybody mode. But, statistically, one vote in scores of millions makes no more difference than a single grain of sand on a beach. That‚Äôs entirely apart from the fact that officials manifestly do what they want, not what you want, once they are in office. 
Nick Giambruno: What about voting for the Libertarian Party? 
Doug Casey: The Libertarian Party once had a claim to being the party of principle, back in the days when people like John Hospers, Harry Browne, and Ron Paul were their candidates. Then they for some reason put forward the empty suit Bob Barr, an ex-Congressman. 
It appears that the Libertarian Party has been captured by the Republicans, which is surprisingly clever on the Republicans‚Äô part. Now they have two parties that are registered in all 50 states. It‚Äôs kind of a backup system to the regular Republican Party. They‚Äôll need a backup since the old GOP is a dead duck. 
Regarding Gary Johnson, I don‚Äôt know what his philosophical beliefs, if any, are. I suspect neither, does he. The only thing we really know is that he wants to see pot legalized on a national scale. Well, bravo. I‚Äôm all for that, even though I‚Äôm not a toker. It‚Äôs a step in the right direction toward dismantling the insane War on Some Drugs. But does he have any other libertarian tendencies? He doesn‚Äôt seem to even have a grasp of the basic principles‚Ä¶ although he seems better than the average politician. But that‚Äôs not saying much. 
I‚Äôm especially concerned about his running mate, William Weld, who‚Äôs an actual neocon. He‚Äôs an overt statist, an active promoter of warfare, welfare, taxes and regulations. He has no libertarian tendencies at all that I‚Äôm aware of. He‚Äôs a pure Deep State guy. 
One thing you‚Äôve got to say about the Democratic Party is that, while their ideas are destructive and evil, at least they‚Äôre honest about them. Democrats make no bones about being the party of socialism, and they naturally attract the envy-driven, the class warriors, the politically correct, the cultural Marxists, the race baiters, the gender Nazis, and the like. The Democratic Party is beyond redemption. It needs to be flushed. It has zero redeeming value. 
The Republicans attract a different group. Religious people. Cultural traditionalists. People who generally favor what they think is the free market. They tend to be much more nationalistic and pro-military than the Democrats. But, unlike the Dems, the Reps have no real philosophical foundation. They‚Äôre basically just non-Democrats‚Ä¶ 
The Democrats can be viewed as the evil party and the Republicans as the stupid party. But they‚Äôre really just two sides of the same coin, at least when it comes to their leadership‚Äîwho are all Deep State members. 
The Libertarians must now be viewed, at best, as the smart wing of the stupid party. It‚Äôs a sad testimony to the nature of politics‚Ä¶ 
The situation has actually gotten out of control, and the government is so big and so powerful at this point that it can‚Äôt be reversed. Even if Ron Paul were elected, it wouldn‚Äôt do any good. 
The first thing that would happen is that he would be sat down with a bunch of generals and heads of Praetorian agencies, like the FBI, the NSA and the CIA, who would inform him‚Äîpolitely, but firmly‚Äîhow things really work. If he didn‚Äôt play by their rules, his life would be at risk. And if for some reason he dodged those bullets, he would be impeached by Congress before he had the chance to actually change anything. And if for some reason that didn‚Äôt work, the average American would be out in the street rioting, because his doggy dish was going to be broken. Don‚Äôt forget, almost 50% of Americans are net recipients of government benefits. 
I‚Äôm afraid that when the looming crisis blows up, the American people‚Äî Boobus Americanus as H. L. Mencken said‚Äîis going to clamor for somebody to kiss it all and make it better. We could very well wind up with some type of a military dictatorship. 
Nick Giambruno: I agree, Doug. I also do not vote. And there are far more powerful ways to vote anyway. 
You can vote with your money by swapping fiat currency stored in a fractional reserve banking system (like the US dollar) for physical gold and silver. 
You can also vote with your feet by leaving the country. 
Instead of voting for a politician, which only creates the illusion of making a difference, those two steps can actually make a positive change in your life. 
What‚Äôs your take? 
Doug Casey: I agree. The thing is that all of our ancestors‚Äîall of us who are Americans‚Äîcame from foreign countries. Everybody came to America because they wanted to get away from being turned into slaves in their home countries. The problem is that the US government is going in the same direction as those governments that our ancestors ran away from. Now we have to go someplace else ourselves. We have to find a new America. 
I‚Äôm very pleased that I can watch all this nonsense on a widescreen in a coffee shop in Argentina and not be very adversely affected by it. Argentina, incidentally, is now going the right way from many points of view. 
It‚Äôs dangerous to stay rooted in one place when the natives get restless. Ask Russians in the 20‚Äôs, Germans in the 30‚Äôs, any European in the 40‚Äôs, Chinese in the 50‚Äôs, Cubans in the 60‚Äôs, Vietnamese in the 70‚Äôs, Rhodesians in the 80‚Äôs‚Äîor Venezuelans today. And that‚Äôs just an incomplete list off the top of my head. It‚Äôs especially risky if you have some assets during real economic upset, or ideas that aren‚Äôt mainstream when there‚Äôs real political turbulence. 
Nick Giambruno: Most Americans are effectively stuck in the US. So, looking at these disturbing socio-political trends, what else could happen? 
Doug Casey: It‚Äôs amazing, and disturbing, that most of the young people in the US support Bernie, an avowed socialist, whose ideas are, if anything, worse than Hillary‚Äôs. But it just shows how unhappy young people are with the status quo. Justifiably unhappy. 
Bernie and Trump hit the same nerve‚Äîthey sensed that we‚Äôre on the edge of a revolution in this country. We really are. The situation is not unlike that before the War Between the States, very unstable. 
Both sides are extremely antagonistic. People either hate Trump or they hate Hillary. It doesn‚Äôt matter who wins; the other side is going to be very, very unhappy. And with tensions already running high in the country, and racial, cultural and social clashes in the background, it almost feels like a civil war is in the cards for the US. 
Of course, it seemed like we could have had a civil war back in the late 60‚Äôs and early 70‚Äôs when there were not just a few, but thousands of bombings. Not just little riots, like in Ferguson and Baltimore, but conflagrations like in Watts, DC, and Detroit, where the National Guard was raking the ghetto with .50 cals. 
But the country‚Äôs prosperity was still increasing in those days. Now we‚Äôre on the cusp of The Greater Depression. Things could get ugly. 
Contrary to what most believe, the US hasn‚Äôt had a real civil war yet. The unpleasantness of 1861‚Äì65 was actually a war of secession. A civil war is one where two or more groups are vying for the control of the same government, as in Spain during the 30‚Äôs, between the fascists and the communists. 
But this time in the US it could turn into a real civil war. I don‚Äôt know what form it would take, but a lot of things could be really tough going: economically, financially, politically, socially, militarily. Most important, there‚Äôs a cultural divide that‚Äôs arisen in the US. 
I don‚Äôt think most people are even aware of what is going on. When you walk outside, the sun is shining. Children are still playing. You can go down to the Wal-Mart and buy cheap goods. Everything looks pretty good on the surface, despite the fact everyone‚Äôs credit card is maxed out. But I think it‚Äôs all a hologram that‚Äôs about to be exposed. So, hold on to your hat.",1

Analyst: Most Americans like neither Candidate,"Analyst: Most Americans like neither Candidate 11/04/2016 
PRESS TV US Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton‚Äôs unpopularity among American voters has reached a new high, according to recent polls, putting her on par with her Republican rival Donald Trump. 
According to the final pre-election New York Times/CBS News Poll released on Thursday, an overwhelming majority of American voters are disgusted by the state of US politics, and most view Trump and Clinton as dishonest. 
More than 80 percent of voters say the presidential campaign has left them repulsed rather than excited, the poll found. 
‚ÄúHaving the two most hated politicians running for president of the US representing the two largest political parties has made a mockery of our democracy and electoral process,‚Äù Hoenig told Press TV on Friday. 
‚ÄúHillary Clinton lied and stole her way to the nomination for the Democrats and Trump bullied his way by insulting every interest group in America, including his fellow Republican opponents,‚Äù he added. 
‚ÄúFor the third parties we have Gary Johnson of the Libertarian Party, who has been made a laughing stock for his ignorance of foreign policy. His poll numbers are dropping. The other 3rd party candidate is Jill Stein of the Green Party who is seeing an actual rise in her numbers in spite of lies and smears coming from mostly the Democrats, with assistance from the main stream media,‚Äù he said. 
‚ÄúThat the race is tightening is no surprise. It often happens at this time but the reasons now are not because people are becoming more assured of who they want but more and more disgusted in the choices they have,‚Äù he stated. 
‚ÄúRegardless of who wins, and it‚Äôs most probable that it‚Äôll be either Clinton or Trump, this country‚Äôs nightmare will only begin on Jan 21st, the day after the inauguration. If it‚Äôs Clinton one wouldn‚Äôt be surprised if the ink on the articles of impeachment isn‚Äôt already dried. By then, it‚Äôs possible that criminal charges will have been presented to her or that she had received by then a presidential pardon from the outgoing President Obama,‚Äù the analyst noted. 
‚ÄúPresident Ford once said, when he was a leader in the House of Representatives, that impeachment is for whatever the Congress wants it to be. Simply the whiff of impropriety or criminal behavior would make any partisan congressman see that as reason enough for such an article of impeachment. Compound that with an actual indictment and it‚Äôs guaranteed,‚Äù he said. 
The commentator said, ‚ÄúTrump has a different set of problems if he were to be inaugurated in January. His positions are so outlandish that even his own party, which by and large has rejected him, would pounce on anything he does that would jeopardize their chances as a party and individually in the next off-year elections of 2018.‚Äù 
‚ÄúWe have to look inward as to what kind of nation we are that we have degenerated to the point where a majority of Americans want neither candidate to win,‚Äù he said in his concluding remarks.",1
Crack in Earth‚Äôs magnetic shield detected,"Crack in Earth‚Äôs magnetic shield detected 11/04/2016 
DNA INDIA 
The world‚Äôs largest and most sensitive cosmic ray monitor, located in India, has recorded a burst of galactic cosmic rays that indicates a crack in the Earth‚Äôs magnetic shield, according to scientists. 
The burst occurred when a giant cloud of plasma ejected from the solar corona struck Earth at a very high speed causing massive compression of the Earth‚Äôs magnetosphere and triggering a severe geomagnetic storm. 
The GRAPES-3 muon telescope located at Tata Institute of Fundamental Research‚Äôs Cosmic Ray Laboratory in Ooty in Tamil Nadu recorded a burst of galactic cosmic rays of about 20 GeV last year lasting for two hours. 
The burst occurred when a giant cloud of plasma ejected from the solar corona, and moving with a speed of about 2.5 million kilometres per hour struck our planet, causing a severe compression of Earth‚Äôs magnetosphere from 11 to 4 times the radius of Earth. 
It triggered a severe geomagnetic storm that generated aurora borealis and radio signal blackouts in many high latitude countries, according to the study published in the journal Physical Review Letters this week. 
Earth‚Äôs magnetosphere extends over a radius of a million kilometres, which acts as the first line of defence, shielding us from the continuous flow of solar and galactic cosmic rays, thus protecting life on our planet from these high intensity energetic radiations. 
Numerical simulations performed by the GRAPES-3 researchers, including Pravata K Mohanty, indicate that the Earth‚Äôs magnetic shield temporarily cracked due to the occurrence of magnetic reconnection, allowing the lower energy galactic cosmic ray particles to enter our atmosphere. 
Earth‚Äôs magnetic field bent these particles about 180 degree, from the day-side to the night-side of the Earth where it was detected as a burst by the GRAPES-3 muon telescope around mid-night on 22 June 2015. 
The data was analysed and interpreted through extensive simulation over several weeks by using the 1280-core computing farm that was built in-house by the GRAPES-3 team of physicists and engineers at the Cosmic Ray Laboratory in Ooty. 
Solar storms can cause major disruption to human civilisation by crippling large electrical power grids, global positioning systems (GPS), satellite operations and communications.",1
Feds warn NYC officials about possible al Qaeda attack,"Feds warn NYC officials about possible al Qaeda attack 11/04/2016 
NEW YORK POST 
New York City law enforcement authorities are on high alert after receiving a warning by the feds about a possible attack by al Qaeda on the eve of Election Day, sources said. 
US intelligence officials alerted joint terrorism task forces of the threat, which also included Texas and Virginia ‚Äî though specific sites targeted for Monday in the three states were not mentioned, a federal source told The Post. 
Mayor Bill de Blasio said Friday he had learned of the threat several days ago during classified briefings. 
‚ÄúWe are still very much assessing the credibility. It is not at all clear how credible this is,‚Äù de Blasio told WNYC‚Äôs Brian Lehrer on his weekly radio show. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre certainly in a vigilant position.‚Äù 
Hizzoner said the NYPD is planning an ‚Äúextraordinary‚Äù police presence for Tuesday, when Americans go to the polls. 
‚ÄúFor the first time in memory there will be two presidential campaigns having their victory celebrations in New York City on Tuesday night,‚Äù he said, quickly correcting himself that only one candidate will be celebrating. 
Donald Trump, the Republican nominee, will be at the New York Hilton Midtown on Sixth Avenue, while Hillary Clinton, his Democratic counterpart, will be at the Javits Convention Center across town on 11th Avenue. 
Police also will be heavily deployed for the New York City Marathon on Sunday, de Blasio said. 
Meanwhile, Gov. Andrew Cuomo declined to confirm the threat Friday but also noted the high state of alert for Election Day. 
‚ÄúWe have more state police, more National Guard, more soldiers on duty than ever before,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúSo the bad news is New York is often a threat. The good news is we‚Äôve been dealing with this now for over a decade and we have prepared for it.‚Äù 
The NYPD and the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey said they had been alerted to the possible attacks. 
‚ÄúWe are aware of the information. We have been working with the FBI through the Joint Terrorism Task Force and our Counterterrorism and Intelligence Bureaus,‚Äù the NYPD said in a statement. 
‚ÄúWe continue to encourage anyone with any information that could be relevant to the safety of our city to contact law enforcement,‚Äù the department said. 
The Port Authority ‚Äî which operates airports, tunnels and bridges in and around the Big Apple ‚Äî said it too was prepared. 
‚ÄúWe are continuing the high level of security we have had in place at all of our facilities for many months,‚Äù spokesman Steve Coleman told The Post. 
The FBI did not comment specifically about the threat against the three states, but said counterterrorism and Homeland Security authorities ‚Äúremain vigilant and well-postured‚Äù to handle attacks. 
‚ÄúThe FBI, working with our federal, state and local counterparts, shares and assesses intelligence on a daily basis and will continue to work closely with law enforcement and intelligence community partners to identify and disrupt any potential threat to public safety,‚Äù an FBI official said. 
Friday‚Äôs threat followed a report by NBC News that the US government believes hackers from Russia or other countries may try to unleash cyberattacks to wreak havoc ahead of Election Day. 
An effort coordinated by the White House and the Department of Homeland Security ‚Äî and including the CIA, the National Security Agency and other elements of the Department of Defense ‚Äî is being conducted to avert attacks, NBC News reported.",1

The man behind the Trump rally disturbance in Reno,"The man behind the Trump rally disturbance in Reno 11/06/2016 
USA TODAY 
The man who caused a commotion at a Donald Trump rally Saturday said he‚Äôs a registered Republican who wanted only to show his displeasure with his party‚Äôs nominee. 
Members of the audience at the event for the GOP presidential nominee tackled Austyn Crites, 33, of Reno after someone yelled ‚Äúgun‚Äù while others were trying to rip away his anti-Trump sign. 
‚ÄúI just went with sign that said ‚ÄòRepublicans Against Trump,‚Äô ‚Äù Crites said. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a sign that you can find online. I held up the sign and initially people around me were just booing me telling me to get out of there. Then a couple of these guys tried grabbing the sign out of my hands.‚Äù 
Crites had no weapon. Secret Service agents later released a statement to that effect and let him go without charges. 
Agents whisked Trump offstage because Crites was near the front of the auditorium at the Reno-Sparks Convention Center. 
Crites said he holds no ill will toward the Secret Service or Reno police, who were just doing their job. 
‚ÄúI was trying to get the Secret Service‚Äôs attention for them to respond,‚Äù said Michael Newton, 45, of Santa Rosa, Calif., who helped restrain Crites. ‚ÄúThey didn‚Äôt respond. I thought I had to do something. I put my knee on what I think was his head, so I‚Äôm not really sure. There were five guys on him and he was moving. I tried to help them immobilize him.‚Äù In final Colorado push, Trump urges supporters to hand-deliver ballots 
Newton said he felt as if Crites were the aggressor. 
‚ÄúI saw his hand contact someone‚Äôs face,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúMaybe two people.‚Äù 
Crites said he didn‚Äôt strike anyone, but after he was taken to the ground, he felt as if he were being mobbed. 
‚ÄúMultiple people just tackled me down, kicking me choking me and just beating me up,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs when things even got crazier. I was on the ground and people were holding my arms, legs and I kept saying I can barely breathe. I was turning my neck just to get a little bit of air to keep from passing out.‚Äù 
That‚Äôs when police intervened, taking Crites away in handcuffs. 
Newton‚Äôs partner, Donald Newton, 47, of Santa Rosa took video of the immediate aftermath. 
The Secret Service said its investigation is ongoing. The agency uses magnetometers at presidential campaign sites, making it difficult for weapons to be smuggled into events. 
What‚Äôs baffling to Crites is how anyone could have thought he had a gun. His sign was in the air for some time and he wasn‚Äôt making any sudden movements, he said. 
‚ÄúIt wasn‚Äôt like they noticed something suspicious and tackled me,‚Äù Crites said. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs not the case.‚Äù 
He said he backs some GOP candidates and just wanted to voice frustration with Trump, not cause panic. 
‚ÄúI love all the people in that rally,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre all fellow Americans. They‚Äôre doing their patriotic duty. They support their candidate. I‚Äôm just there showing that I‚Äôm a Republican. I‚Äôm all of your people‚Äôs brother. I just have a slight difference of opinion.‚Äù 
Later on Facebook, Crites wrote that he has no connection with the campaign of Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton but has canvassed for her for about three hours, contributed to her campaign and voted for her. 
‚ÄúTake what happened to me tonight as a classic example of dictator incitement of violence ‚Äî against your own Republican brother with a stupid sign,‚Äù he wrote. The post and his entire account were taken down soon afterward as some Trump supporters on social media called him a ‚ÄúClinton thug,‚Äù‚ÄúHillary shill‚Äù and ‚ÄúTrump assassin.‚Äù 
Shortly after the incident at the rally, Trump returned to the stage to raucous applause, thanking the Secret Service and launching back into his prepared remarks. His campaign later issued a statement also thanking the Secret Service and his supporters.

Opinion: Hillary is the Whore of Babylon and is not Human,"Opinion: Hillary is the Whore of Babylon and is not Human 11/06/2016 
TRACY TWYMAN 
I put some of this information in an article I published yesterday morning about a larger subject. Today I have decided to isolate these segments and add more for a comprehensive piece on the subject because other relevant information has emerged. 
People in the FBI think Hillary Clinton is the Anti-Christ . They are close. She is the Whore of Babylon. 
Hillary was born in 1948, supposedly. I looked for this information on a hunch, after noticing several clues. And sure enough, back in 2008, someone on David Icke‚Äôs forum speculated that Hillary may have been the ‚ÄúMoonchild‚Äù that, according to artist Marjorie Cameron , was implanted into her own womb by rocket scientist, occultist, and Crowley associate Jack Parsons during a ritual called the ‚Äú Babalon Working .‚Äù The purpose was to birth a child to be an incarnation of what Crowley called ‚Äú Babalon ,‚Äù the Scarlet Whore with the cup of blood foretold in St. John‚Äôs Revelation that rides the Beast. 
Cameron actually claimed that this fetus, after being taken from her womb, was delivered to people involved in the military‚Äôs nuclear weapons progranm, who were apparently in cahoots with Parsons, and placed inside of a nuclear bomb that was tested. But the fetus ‚Äúsurvived,‚Äù she said, because it had been placed inside of a special canister made exactly for this purpose. For the 1945 ‚ÄúTrinity‚Äù bomb test they made a special canister called ‚ÄúJumbo‚Äù that was supposed to to preserve the plutonium if the bomb did failed to go off. They reportedly didn‚Äôt end up using it for that, but it has been suggested that this is what preserved the fetus of the Moonchild. Presumably, it grew up to be somebody. 
Crowley named one of his female consorts (who he always called his ‚ÄúScarlet Women‚Äù) ‚ÄúHilarion.‚Äù Her name was Jeanne Foster. Crowley‚Äôs attempt to conceive an heir as a ‚Äúmagical child‚Äù with Hilarion resulted, supposedly, in the child‚Äôs spirit being attached to his protege Charles Stanfield Jones back in 1909. The ‚Äúattachment‚Äù allegedly occurred when Jones went through the ritual for ‚ÄúCrossing the Abyss‚Äù in the 11th degree of the O.T.O., which involves being ritually sodomized by everyone in the group. 
Jack Parsons, another person who had willingly subjected himself to this ritual, channeled The Book of the Antichrist in 1949, where he foretold: 
And within seven years of this time, BABALON, THE SCARLET WOMAN HILARION will manifest among ye, and bring this my work to its fruition. 
I also believe that Hillary, with her notorious cracking voice, and possibly her rival Trump, were foretold in another document channeled by Parsons, the Book of Babalon : 
Her voice is sure as the judgement trump to crack the house of wrong, Though walls are high and stone is hard and the rule of hell was long The gates shall fall and the irons break in the Birth of BABALON. 
In Rome the Hilaria was a festival to the goddess Cybele (worshipped in the form of a black meteorite stone) to celebrate the ‚Äúresurrection‚Äù of her son, who, as the legend states, she had been having sex with. She then became jealous of his love of others, castrated him, and let him die of bleeding (the reason why all of her priests, the Galli, were castrated, and actually considered women). She later regretted this and caused him to be brought back to life, then forced everyone under her rule to celebrate by laughing and partying joyously, as commemorated in this festival. Consider this next time you notice Hillary Clinton laughing ‚Äúinappropriately.‚Äù 
Also note that Hillary Clinton has made several self-depricating jokes about herself being ‚Äú not even human ‚Äù and ‚Äúshort-circuiting‚Äù when she gets herself twisted up in her own lies. Specifically, in October 2015, when her interviewer at Buzzfeed noted that she seemed to not be sweating, even though it was a hot day (odd, because Hillary has notoriously bad B.O.), she asked Hillary what kind of deodorant she used. Clinton‚Äôs reply was astounding. 
You guys are the first to realize that I‚Äôm really not even a human being. I was constructed in a garage in Palo Alto a very long time ago‚Ä¶ I mean, a man whose name shall remain nameless created me in his garage. 
Palo Alto is the location of Stanford University, Jack Parsons‚Äô Alma Mater.",1
US Military Hackers Claim Penetration of Russia,"US Military Hackers Claim Penetration of Russia 11/07/2016 
SPUTNIK NEWS 
US military hackers have penetrated Russia‚Äôs electric grid, telecommunications networks and Kremlin‚Äôs command systems, making them vulnerable to attack by secret American cyber weapons, according to a series of reports by a major US television network. 
NBC News disclosed the penetration in a series of reports, explaining that US efforts parallel claims, also by US officials, that Russia, China and other nations have placed hidden malware on parts of US critical infrastructure. 
The penetration by all sides appears to be in preparation for an all-out war in cyberspace, according to NBC News, which said it was briefed by a US intelligence official and given an opportunity to review highly classified documents. 
At the same time, the network downplayed the prospect of a cyber war, making it appear as if the leak was intended as a warning to US adversaries. 
NBC News then attempted to link its explosive report to Tuesday‚Äôs US presidential election, citing concerns of mischief by Russian hackers that would fall far short of the Armageddon-like scenario that the report implied. 
Instead, the network explained US election-related concerns as ‚Äúcyber mischief,‚Äù which could involve releasing fake documents or creating bogus social media accounts to spread misinformation. 
The Obama administration has created a public, but unconfirmed narrative, that hackers controlled by the Russian government have stolen emails from the Democratic Party headquarters, a private computer used by presidential candidate Hillary Clinton while serving as secretary of State and computers used by Clinton campaign Chairman John Podesta. 
According to the narrative, Russia stole the emails and gave the messages to WikiLeaks, which has flooded the internet with the material on a daily basis leading up to Tuesday‚Äôs election. 
Russia has denied any responsibility for the Clinton-related hacks and links between WikiLeaks and Russian intelligence have never been substantiated. 
Moreover, recent media reports in the United States indicate that Clinton‚Äôs private server she used for official business during her tenure as secretary of state had been penetrated by at least five foreign intelligence services. 
The emails have proved especially embarrassing for the Clinton campaign by disclosing decisions in the Clinton State Department that favored large donors to the Clinton Foundation in what appear to be ‚Äúpay-for-play‚Äù schemes of selling access and influence. 
Moreover, the activity appears to coincide with lucrative speaking engagements for former President Bill Clinton.",1
Is America On The Brink Of Civil War?,"Is America On The Brink Of Civil War? 11/07/2016 
PJ MEDIA 
Valerie Jarrett‚ÄîBarack Obama‚Äôs closest consigliere who has lived in the lap of luxury in and out of the White House‚Äîis calling for James Comey‚Äôs head because the FBI director reopened the matter of Hillary Clinton‚Äôs emails only days before the election. 
As we all know, Comey did this after some 650,000 digital missives, many from Clinton‚Äôs server, were discovered on Anthony Weiner‚Äôs laptop by the NYPD. 
Obama, however, is a bit uneasy about Jarrett‚Äôs hawkishness toward Comey. 
‚ÄúValerie argued that Comey was interfering deliberately in the election process and had to be stopped,‚Äù a source told The New York Post . The same source said Obama, though, is ‚Äúworried about the consequences of taking such an action ‚Äì the tsunami of outrage that would come his way, and possibly become a major footnote, or worse, in the history of the presidency.‚Äù 
Ah, those legacy problems, not that the president has much of one outside the comically named Affordable Care Act, which is about as popular as stomach cancer. 
Nevertheless, he‚Äôs right about the tsunami of outrage. In fact it‚Äôs an understatement. The bad news is this: As miserable as this endless election season has been, the aftermath is likely to be far worse. You don‚Äôt have to be Nostradamus to see that putting the American Humpty Dumpty together again is going to be a herculean task. Our country could be permanently fractured in ways few of us would have anticipated even a year ago. Anything is possible now. 
If Hillary Clinton is elected, the very next day millions of Americans will be watching to see what will happen with the FBI and the Justice Department. Since we can now assume this will be a close election, that would be nearly half the voters in this country, sixty to seventy million people, almost all of whom believe Clinton, the woman a few weeks from inauguration as president, should have been charged with serious crimes and belonged behind bars, not in the White House. 
Moreover, many have seen the WikiLeaks that reek of collusion between the Clintonistas and officials at the FBI and Justice, not to mention with virtually all the mainstream media outlets that were distrusted to begin with and are now reviled. 
If that‚Äôs not an explosive situation, what is? And we don‚Äôt know what Assange et al have in store for us after the election. Just now we learned that the Clinton Foundation accepted‚Äîwhile Her Ladyship was secretary of State and in honor of Bill‚Äôs birthday‚Äîan unreported one million dollar donation from that paragon of women‚Äôs and gay rights, Qatar. This is chump change in the grand Clinton scheme of things, but another reminder of their unending greed and corruption. More importantly, as Tyler Durden points out, this time there should be legal consequences for the foundation‚Äîor would be normally in a country governed by the rule of law. 
Only we‚Äôre not anymore. 
This and a thousand other things put Obama, quite possibly liable himself from the email disclosures, and his attorney general Lynch behind a treacherous eight ball going forward, because they are not dealing with a few thousand disgruntled people, but those many millions. If they were to go ahead with Jarrett‚Äôs suggestion, take Comey‚Äôs head (i. e. fire him) and replace him with a yet more complaisant successor, who knows what would happen? 
But if they don‚Äôt, and even if they do, the investigation may reveal things so shocking the nation will never be the same. Rumors have been flying that are so extreme that even a ten percent accuracy rate could ignite a firestorm. 
The problem for all of us is that there is literally nothing Clinton can do to get out of this box, even if, as many predict, Obama pardons her. The corruption is so pervasive there is no way short of an actual military putsch to stop the continuing revelations. And such an action would itself unleash ‚Ä¶ well, you know the title of this article. 
Would a Trump victory save us from all this? No one knows. Dennis Prager perhaps put it best. When you have two doors and behind one is a man-eating lion and the other one may or may not have such a lion, which door do you choose? Unless you want to commit suicide, the answer is self-evident.",1
Trump breaks from stump speech to admire ‚Äòbeautiful‚Äô Trump mask,"Trump breaks from stump speech to admire ‚Äòbeautiful‚Äô Trump mask 11/07/2016

Midway through a stump speech riff lamenting that Hillary Clinton had appeared on stage with less-than-family-friendly musicians like Jay-Z and Beyonce, Donald Trump paused at an election-eve rally in Florida Monday morning to gawk at an attendee‚Äôs mask. 
‚ÄúThis is different than a Billy Graham crusade, but you know what? We‚Äôre all looking for the same thing. We‚Äôre looking for greatness for our country. We‚Äôre looking for religious liberty,‚Äù the Manhattan billionaire said before the rubber Trump mask caught his eye. ‚ÄúLook at this mask. Look at this mask. Oh wow. Wow, that‚Äôs beautiful. Look at that. Looks just like me.‚Äù 
Trump then left the podium for a few seconds as the mask made its way up to the stage. He returned to the microphone and held up the mask next to his own face, before examining it closer. He held it up once more time and joked ‚Äúnice head of hair, I‚Äôll say that,‚Äù before tossing it back. 
‚ÄúIs there any place more fun to be than a Trump rally?‚Äù has asked the crowd before resuming his remarks, turning to his proposal to stimulate job growth in the U.S. by placing a tariff on companies who move production out of the country. 
The Sarasota, Florida, rally is the first of five for Trump on Monday. From Florida, he will head to events in North Carolina, Pennsylvania, New Hampshire and Michigan. He will be joined at the final two by his running mate, Indiana Gov. Mike Pence.",1

Trump kicked off his Election Day eve blitz with a rally Monday in Florida. He told the Sarasota crowd that ‚Äò‚Äòthe system is rigged, but at least we know it.‚Äô‚Äô 
He claimed that ‚Äò‚Äòour country is a laughing stock all over the world.‚Äô‚Äô 
The Republican nominee than pantomimed quotation marks when he said the word ‚Äò‚Äòjustice‚Äô‚Äô as he hit the FBI and the Department of Justice for their handling of the case.

An ex-aide to former President Bill Clinton alleged in a hacked email that Chelsea Clinton used the family‚Äôs charitable foundation to help underwrite her 2010 wedding. 
The 2012 exchange between Doug Band and Hillary Clinton campaign chairman John Podesta was released by the WikiLeaks organization. Stolen messages have chronicled tensions within the Clinton Foundation between Band and the daughter of the Democratic presidential nominee. 
Band told Podesta that Chelsea Clinton was gossiping to outsiders that she was investigating questionable spending. Band suggested that she is the one who should be scrutinized for ‚Äò‚Äòusing foundation resources for her wedding.‚Äô‚Äô He did not provide details about this. A Clinton Foundation spokesman did not immediately respond to a request for comment. 
Band was later forced out amid issues with his outside consulting firm.

That‚Äôs the same phrasing the White House used when Comey initially announced that the FBI was looking into more emails related to its investigation of Clinton. In a follow-up letter Sunday, Comey said the FBI review was completed and it was standing by its recommendation that no charges be filed.

Philadelphia‚Äôs public transit system will be up and running in time for Election Day now that a weeklong strike has ended. That‚Äôs a relief to the state‚Äôs Democrats. 
Democratic city officials were worried that the strike could affect turnout at the polls Tuesday. Pennsylvania does not offer early voting, so Election Day turnout is key. 
The state has favored Democrats in recent presidential elections, but polls suggest the race is tightening. Democrat Hillary Clinton is counting on strong support in the Philadelphia area. Both candidates are campaigning in the state Tuesday. 
The Southeastern Pennsylvania Transportation Authority and the union representing roughly 4,700 transit workers announced a tentative agreement early Monday. Subways were soon operating on a reduced schedule and limited trolled serve was restored.

Department officials say personnel will be sent to 67 jurisdictions to watch for potential civil rights violations. Monday‚Äôs announcement comes amid rising concerns about voter intimidation, particularly aimed at minorities. 
The number of personnel is less than the roughly 780 monitors and observers who were dispatched in 2012. 
The Justice Department has said its poll-watching presence has been curtailed by a 2013 Supreme Court opinion that gutted a key provision of the Voting Rights Act. 
In a statement, Attorney General Loretta Lynch said the department is committed to ensuring that every eligible voter can participate in the election.

Kremlin: NATO was Created for Agression,"Kremlin: NATO was Created for Agression 11/07/2016 
RUSSIA TODAY Reports of the new reinforcement of NATO troops close to Russia‚Äôs borders show ‚Äúthe aggressive character of the organization,‚Äù the Kremlin has said, commenting on recently announced preparations to deter an alleged Russian threat. 
The Western military alliance was established ‚Äú not for peace-building, but exactly for aggressive actions ,‚Äù Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said on Monday. Despite the fact that blocs which opposed NATO no longer exist, it‚Äôs impossible to change the alliance‚Äôs ‚Äú aggressive nature ‚Äù due to its ideological and political bases. 
Earlier on Monday, the Times published a report suggesting that ‚Äú hundreds of thousands of NATO troops will be put on a higher state of alert amid growing tensions with Russia .‚Äù According to the British daily ‚Äì which cites the alliance‚Äôs secretary-general, Jens Stoltenberg, and the UK‚Äôs outgoing permanent representative to the bloc, Adam Thomson ‚Äì NATO aims to largely speed up the time its troops can be deployed. 
It reportedly aims to have up to 300,000 military personnel from nations across the alliance at the ready, having shortened their response time to about two months, compared to the current 180 days. 
‚Äú We are responding with the biggest reinforcement of our collective defense since the end of the Cold War ,‚Äù Stoltenberg told the Times . The bloc is looking into how more of its 3 million personnel ‚Äú can be ready on a shorter notice ,‚Äù he added, saying that NATO defense ministers have already had discussions on the issue. 
Having accused Moscow of ‚Äú assertive ‚Äù behavior, the NATO chief said Russia had increased its defense spending and was ‚Äú developing new military capabilities .‚Äù 
‚Äú In regard to its national security, Russia acts within its national borders, undoubtedly posing no threat to anyone ,‚Äù Peskov said, commenting on Stoltenberg‚Äôs statements. The way the military bloc has reacted ‚Äú once again shows the organization‚Äôs aggressive nature ,‚Äù he added.",1

Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton leads her Republican rival by three percentage points nationally as they head into the final day of a tight race for the White House, according to a new poll. 
The final Bloomberg Politics-Selzer & Co poll released on Monday has Clinton ahead of Trump, 44 percent to 41 percent. 
Libertarian candidate Gary Johnson was at 4 percent and Green Party candidate Jill Stein had 2 percent support. 
Clinton also leads Trump by three points in a hypothetical two-way matchup when third-party candidates are not included. 
Another tracking poll released early on Monday also put Clinton in the lead. 
The former secretary of state held a four-point lead over the billionaire businessman in the latest ABC News/Washington Post poll. The survey showed 47 percent of likely US voters backed Clinton while 43 percent said they supported Trump. 
The Clinton campaign received a late break with FBI Director James Comey announcing Sunday that no criminal charges were forthcoming in the probe of Clinton‚Äôs newly-found emails. 
‚ÄúBased on our review, we have not changed our conclusions that we expressed in July,‚Äù the FBI chief wrote in a new letter to congressional committee chairmen. 
The development is a major relief to Clinton, who is spending the final hours of her campaign trying to close Trump‚Äôs path to presidency. Donald Trump walks off the stage after holding a rally at Loudoun Fairgrounds in Leesburg, Virginia, early in the morning on November 7, 2016. (Photo by AFP) 
Comey sent the presidential race into a frenzy last month when he sent a letter to Congress saying the FBI had discovered emails in a separate probe that could be linked to the investigation into Clinton‚Äôs use of a private server when she was secretary of state. 
The surprise move infuriated Democrats and lifted the presidential hopes of Trump, who has turned the email controversy into a favorite line of attack against Clinton. 
Still, Trump continued to seize on the email issue, insisting that Clinton is ‚Äúguilty.‚Äù 
‚ÄúHillary Clinton is guilty. She knows it, the FBI knows it, the people know,‚Äù he said Sunday at a rally in Detroit, Michigan. ‚ÄúAnd now it‚Äôs up to the American people to deliver justice at the ballot box on November 8.‚Äù 
Both Clinton and Trump plan to spend the last day of the campaign racing across key battleground states that could determine the results of Tuesday‚Äôs election.

"Janet Reno, First Female US Attorney General, Dies At 78","Janet Reno, First Female US Attorney General, Dies At 78 11/07/2016 
NPR 
Janet Reno, the first woman to serve as attorney general of the United States, died early Monday from complications of Parkinson‚Äôs disease. Reno‚Äôs goddaughter Gabrielle D‚ÄôAlemberte and sister Margaret Hurchalla confirmed her passing to NPR. 
Reno spent her final days at home in Miami surrounded by family and friends, D‚ÄôAlemberte told The Associated Press. She was 78. 
Reno served longer in the job than anyone had in 150 years. And her tenure was marked by tragedy and controversy. But she left office widely respected for her independence and accomplishments. 
She was not President Bill Clinton‚Äôs first choice to head the Justice Department, nor his second. But after his No. 1 pick went down in confirmation flames, and his second choice also proved controversial, Clinton finally turned to Reno. 
She was an unexpected pick. She had no connections to Clinton or Washington. But Clinton wanted a woman, and Reno was a big-time prosecutor, holding the top prosecutor‚Äôs job in Miami-Dade County, a position she had been elected to four times over 15 years. 
Jamie Gorelick, who would later become deputy attorney general, was assigned to prep Reno for her confirmation hearing. ‚ÄúShe was the least air-brushed candidate we have ever had for a Cabinet-level position,‚Äù says Gorelick. ‚ÄúShe was herself, and she didn‚Äôt change herself for Washington.‚Äù 
Reno arrived at the Justice Department knowing no one, and was immediately plunged into the siege at the Branch Davidian compound outside Waco, Texas. Four federal agents had been killed and 16 wounded while serving a warrant to search for illegal guns. Seven weeks into the siege, pressed by the FBI, Reno authorized a raid on the compound, resulting in 76 deaths, including as many as 25 children and the Davidian leader David Koresh, who ordered his followers to set fire to the compound. 
In two sets of Waco congressional hearings over the next two years, Reno would successfully quell critics on the right and left. 
‚ÄúWhat haunted me,‚Äù Reno explained at one hearing, ‚Äúwas that if I did not go in, I might be sitting there 10 days [later] ‚Ä¶ when [Koresh] came out with explosives, blew himself, some agents and the entire place up.‚Äù 
Years later, however, in an interview with NPR shortly before leaving office, her regret was palpable. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôll never know whether it was a mistake or not, in one sense,‚Äù Reno admitted. ‚ÄúBut knowing what I do, I would not do it again. I would try to figure another way.‚Äù 
‚ÄúWaco didn‚Äôt make her hesitant: It made her insistent about getting her own information,‚Äù observes Walter Dellinger, who served in two top Justice Department jobs under Reno. 
Dellinger believes, for instance, that it may have been the Waco experience that led Reno to go personally to Miami in April 2000 to see if there was a way to avoid a forcible removal of 6-year-old Cuban refugee Eli√°n Gonz√°lez from the home of a great-uncle so the boy could be returned to his only living parent, in Cuba. 
Eli√°n had been rescued at sea after his mother and eight others drowned trying to get to the United States. Rescued by fishermen and brought to the U.S., he was soon turned over to his great-uncle. The Cuban community in Miami was in an uproar over the idea of returning the boy to his father, who lived in Cuba, and the furor soon bled over to Congress. 
But when negotiations with the great-uncle failed, armed federal agents, acting on Reno‚Äôs orders, raided the home, removed Eli√°n, and turned him over to his father, who had come to the U.S. to receive his son. When the U.S. Supreme Court refused to intervene, the two returned to their home in Cuba.

Over the course of time, Reno would become embroiled in many controversies. She sought the appointment of a series of independent counsels to investigate four fellow Cabinet members and President Clinton himself. But she refused to authorize an independent counsel investigation of contributions to the Clinton-Gore campaign after Justice Department lawyers concluded no crime had been committed by either the president or vice president. 
The decision so infuriated Republicans that some called for her impeachment. ‚ÄúThis is the most politicized Justice Department in the history of the United States,‚Äù railed Dan Burton, the Republican chairman of a key House oversight committee. 
At 6 feet 2 inches, however, Reno stood tall in the political crosswinds. Gorelick observes that when members of Congress, like Burton, were unhappy with a government official, they threatened to call that official to testify. But Reno, who had served as a staffer in the Florida state Legislature, always said, ‚ÄúFine, I‚Äôll be there.‚Äù As a result, says Gorelick, ‚Äúeventually all those who were threatening her with a hearing stopped doing that, because she prevailed in every outing that I can recall ‚Äî she just went in there and laid out her views and bested those who would challenge her.‚Äù 
The controversies that the Justice Department faced during Reno‚Äôs reign often eclipsed the many things that went well: the quick apprehension and successful prosecution of the Oklahoma City bombers, for example; the pursuit of bombers of women‚Äôs health clinics that provide abortions; and the solving of the so-called Unabomber case. 
After nearly two decades of fruitless pursuit, the FBI still had no idea as to the identity of the man dubbed the Unabomber, who had killed three people and injured 23. Then, in 1995, the bomber sent a letter to The New York Times offering to cease his terror campaign if the Times or the Washington Post would publish his 35,000-word manifesto against modern industry and technology. Neither newspaper was inclined to do that initially, but Reno, the daughter of two newspaper journalists, persuaded the newspaper owners to jointly publish the essay in the interests of public safety. 
It paid off. The Unabomber‚Äôs brother recognized the style and ideas in the essay and tipped off the FBI, ending the bomber‚Äôs long reign of terror. Theodore Kaczynski, aka the Unabomber, is now serving a life term in a maximum security federal prison. 
In 1995 Reno was diagnosed with Parkinson‚Äôs disease. She did not slow down, but her hands sometimes shook so hard you could hear them knocking against the table at a congressional hearing. She even joked about the disease, claiming that ‚Äúshaking sometimes helps,‚Äù as in playing a steel drum or balancing her kayak. 
That combination of toughness and self-deprecating humor, plus her determination to protect the Justice Department from improper influence, made her a hero to many who worked for her. 
‚ÄúJanet Reno led with her values,‚Äù says former Deputy Attorney General Gorelick, the department‚Äôs No. 2 official. ‚ÄúAnd that meant that if she decided that a certain path was the right thing to do, the people around her believed her and would charge up any hill behind her. ‚Ä¶ I‚Äôd never seen that before in quite the same way.‚Äù 
Florida gubernatorial candidate and former U.S. Attorney General Janet Reno speaks at the Florida Democratic Party State Conference on April 13, 2002, in Lake Buena Vista, Fla. She lost the Democratic primary. 
Reno won enormous respect inside the department as well, because of her work ethic and dedication to understanding issues in the many parts of the Justice Department ‚Äî from national security, to environmental questions, to the generally obscure field of Indian law. 
U.S. Attorney General Loretta Lynch called her ‚Äúone of the most effective, decisive and well-respected-leaders in [the department‚Äôs] proud history‚Äù who ‚Äúnever shied from criticism or shirked responsibility.‚Äù And former Attorney General Eric Holder said that ‚Äúin a city where too many compromise their values for short term political gain, Janet Reno stood out as a person of integrity and of enduring values.‚Äù 
Former Solicitor General Dellinger believes that Reno was prepared for the attorney general‚Äôs job early in life by her intellect and ungainly height. ‚ÄúThis is a woman that went to Cornell and Harvard Law School at a time when very few women went to Harvard Law School, went through junior high and high school being twice as tall as anybody else and probably twice as smart ‚Ä¶ and that‚Äôs really, really tough.‚Äù 
There were, of course, ups and downs in the eight years of Reno‚Äôs reign. But she said she always took the long view of her job. 
‚ÄúIf the end brings me out right, what people said about me won‚Äôt make any difference, and if the end brings me out wrong, 10 angels saying I was right won‚Äôt make any difference,‚Äù she said in an interview with NPR in 1997. 
President Clinton made little secret of his frequent displeasure with Reno and the wall of separation she erected between the Justice Department and the White House. Still, he never asked her to resign. Reno was the last Cabinet member he reappointed after his re-election in 1996. 
‚ÄúIt was actually quite wonderful,‚Äù said Dellinger. ‚ÄúShe just decided to stay, and it turns out that nobody could fire her.‚Äù 
The tension between Clinton and his attorney general was apparent even as Clinton‚Äôs time in office drew to a close. In an interview with CBS News‚Äô 60 Minutes , Clinton went out of his way to praise friends and foes alike, but when it came to his evaluation of Reno, he was tepid, to say the least. 
‚ÄúGood woman,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúTried really hard to do a good job. She‚Äôs a good person.‚Äù 
‚ÄúAt least he didn‚Äôt say I was a bad person,‚Äù replied Reno, with a laugh. ‚ÄúI‚Äôll take what I can get!‚Äù 
Indeed, by the end of her tenure, Janet Reno had outlasted her critics and earned such a reputation for integrity and independence that comedian Will Ferrell‚Äôs parody of her became one of the iconic skits on NBC‚Äôs Saturday Night Live . The recurring skit was inspired by reports that Reno had cut quite a figure dancing at a Justice Department party. 
On the last episode of the ‚ÄúJanet Reno‚Äôs Dance Party‚Äù parody, Ferrell, wearing a blue dress and pearls, reminisces about past glories and laments that the end of the party is near. Then, suddenly, the real Janet Reno comes crashing through the wall of the set, wearing the same blue dress and pearls as Ferrell, to deliver one of Ferrell‚Äôs signature lines: ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs Reno Time!‚Äù 
‚ÄúOh, Janet,‚Äù he says to the real Reno, as he mourns the end of the skit‚Äôs run, ‚Äúwhat do you do when you get sad?‚Äù 
‚ÄúI just dance,‚Äù Reno replies, commanding the orchestra, ‚ÄúNow, hit it!‚Äù as she breaks out her best moves to ‚ÄúTwist and Shout.‚Äù It was her last day in office.",1
5.0 Quake Near Oklahoma Oil Hub Causes Substantial Damage,"5.0 Quake Near Oklahoma Oil Hub Causes Substantial Damage 11/07/2016 
CBS 
A magnitude 5.0 earthquake centered near one of the world‚Äôs key oil hubs brought down building facades and shattered windows in a central Oklahoma city, rendering century-old buildings unsafe and raising concerns about key infrastructure. 
As the sun rose Monday, television news footage showed widespread, substantial damage to buildings, with piles of bricks and other debris littering the ground following the earthquake the previous evening. Cushing Assistant City Manager Jeremy Frazier told a news conference late Sunday that a few minor injuries had been reported. He said the damage appeared to be contained downtown. 
Oklahoma has had thousands of earthquakes in recent years, with nearly all traced to the underground injection of wastewater left over from oil and gas production. Sunday‚Äôs quake was centered 1 mile west of Cushing and about 25 miles south of where a magnitude 4.3 quake forced a shutdown of several wells last week. 
Fearing aftershocks, police cordoned off older parts of the city to keep gawkers away late Sunday, and geologists confirmed that several small quakes have rumbled the area. Frazier said an assisted living community had been evacuated after damage was reported. The Cushing Public School District canceled Monday classes. 
‚ÄúStay out of the area,‚Äù said City Manager Steve Spears, who noted that while some damage was superficial, compromised foundations and other potential problems would be difficult to assess until daylight in the city of 7,900 about 50 miles northeast of Oklahoma City. 
The Oklahoma Department of Transportation reported Sunday night that no highway or bridge damage was found within a 15-mile radius of the earthquake‚Äôs epicenter. 
The quake struck at 7:44 p.m. Sunday and was felt as far away as Iowa, Illinois and Texas. The U.S. Geological Survey initially said Sunday‚Äôs quake was of magnitude 5.3 but later lowered the reading to 5.0. 
‚ÄúI thought my whole trailer was going to tip over, it was shaking it so bad,‚Äù said Cushing resident Cindy Roe, 50. ‚ÄúIt was loud and all the lights went out and you could hear things falling on the ground. 
‚ÄúIt was awful and I don‚Äôt want to have another one.‚Äù 
Cushing‚Äôs oil storage terminal is one of the world‚Äôs largest. As of Oct. 28, tank farms in the countryside around Cushing held 58.5 million barrels of crude oil, according to data from the U.S. Energy Information Administration. The community bills itself as the ‚ÄúPipeline Crossroads of the World.‚Äù 
Frazier said two pipeline companies had reported no trouble as of late Sunday but that the community hadn‚Äôt heard from all companies. Gov. Mary Fallin tweeted that no damage was reported at the storage tanks at Cushing‚Äôs oil storage terminal 
Megan Gustafson and Jonathan Gillespie were working at a Cushing McDonald‚Äôs when the quake hit. 
‚ÄúIt felt like a train was going right through the building, actually,‚Äù Gustafson, 17, said Sunday night as she and her co-workers stood behind a police barricade downtown, looking for damage. ‚ÄúI kind of freaked out and was hyperventilating a bit.‚Äù 
Gillespie said the building shook for about 10 seconds, but that he wasn‚Äôt as alarmed as Gustafson because he lives in an area that has experienced multiple earthquakes, especially in recent years. 
‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt think it was anything new,‚Äù he said. 
According to USGS data, there have been about two dozen earthquakes in Oklahoma in the past week. When particularly strong quakes hit, the Oklahoma Corporation Commission directs well operators to cease wastewater injections or reduce volume. 
A 5.8 earthquake ‚Äî a record for Oklahoma ‚Äî hit Pawnee on Sept. 3. Shortly afterward, geologists speculated on whether the temblor occurred on a previously unknown fault. 
‚ÄúI was at home doing some work in my office and, basically, you could feel the whole house sway some,‚Äù Spears, the Cushing city manager, said Sunday night. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs beginning to become normal.‚Äù",1
Las Vegas May Become the New Amsterdam,"Las Vegas May Become the New Amsterdam 11/07/2016 
HIGH TIMES 
Nevada already has legal brothels, round-the-clock casinos and a coy catchphrase declaring that ‚Äúwhat happens in Vegas, stays in Vegas.‚Äù If voters approve, the state could soon add another vice in the form of recreational marijuana. 
A proposal on the Nov. 8 state ballot would legalize pot, and entrepreneurs hope its passage could someday allow the drug at Las Vegas‚Äô glamorous nightclubs and perhaps provide the framework for a future Amsterdam-style cannabis district. 
‚ÄúI really think this would be the third-largest market in the country,‚Äù said Derek Peterson, whose company operates medical marijuana dispensaries called Blum. He predicts that only California and New York would offer a bigger customer base than Las Vegas and its 42 million tourists a year. ‚ÄúI think it should be able to fit in really well with the whole dayclub/nightclub thing.‚Äù 
Nevada has allowed medical marijuana since 2000, and Peterson sees recreational pot as an alternative for visitors tired of cocktails that can top $15 apiece and inflict hangovers. But before waitresses begin delivering high-grade marijuana at clubs along the Las Vegas Strip, weed proponents will have to win over not just voters, who narrowly support the initiative in polls, but a risk-averse casino industry. 
The Nevada Resort Association came out against the measure, pointing to an opinion from gambling regulators that casino owners should avoid the marijuana industry because the substance remains illegal under federal law. Las Vegas Sands owner Sheldon Adelson has bankrolled most of the opposition, pouring $2 million of his fortune into a campaign that raises the possibility that small children could become intoxicated from candy-like marijuana edibles. 
Adelson also has contributed $1.5 million in Arizona and Massachusetts, a significant share of all anti-marijuana donations there. 
Adelson, whose son died of a drug overdose and whose wife is a doctor specializing in drug addiction, has donated millions toward efforts to defeat medical marijuana proposals in Florida and other states in years past. 
Other casino operators have joined the fray, but to a lesser extent. 
In spite of its libertine reputation, the rigorously regulated casino industry is known to err on the conservative side to avoid scandalizing the middle-aged tourists who are its bread and butter. 
‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know that this is a game changer in terms of tourism,‚Äù Virginia Valentine, president of the Nevada Resort Association, said of marijuana‚Äôs potential. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre really known for other things. You may attract people or turn them off.‚Äù 
The Las Vegas Convention and Visitors Authority, which promotes Sin City‚Äôs amenities to the world, is neutral on the issue. 
Clyde Barrow, a gambling expert who chairs the political science department at the University of Texas-Rio Grande Valley, suggests the donations may indicate the casino companies are acting in their own best interests. 
‚ÄúThe marijuana industry is emerging as another form of recreation and entertainment. Given the casino industry‚Äôs difficulties attracting millennials, marijuana is probably perceived as a direct competitor with casinos for entertainment dollars,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúAnother reason is that legalized marijuana competes with alcohol, and, to that extent, competes with the food and beverage sales at casinos.‚Äù 
There‚Äôs no solid state-sponsored research on how legal recreational marijuana has affected tourism in places that have legalized it, although both sides point to Colorado to make their case. 
Pro-marijuana interests cite a state study that found Colorado set an all-time tourism record in 2015, capping a fifth year of growth. It‚Äôs unclear how much of that is due to weed, and how much can be chalked up to other factors, such as good snow in recent years relative to competing ski states. 
Marijuana opponents refer to a report from the Visit Denver tourism bureau that logged increasing complaints about panhandling and open marijuana consumption in the city‚Äôs downtown corridor. 
‚ÄúDenver is losing visitors and valuable convention business as a result of these overall safety (or perception of safety) issues,‚Äù the report said. ‚ÄúWe fear not being able to brand Denver away from this growing reputation.‚Äù 
Nevada‚Äôs ballot initiative would not allow municipalities to put blanket bans on marijuana, as Colorado does. But it would bar consumption in buildings that are open to the public and permit local governments to restrict the locations of marijuana dispensaries and related businesses. It effectively blocks people from growing their own by banning the practice within 25 miles of a licensed marijuana store.",1
"Russia, China Look To Autonomous Financial System","Russia, China Look To Autonomous Financial System 11/07/2016 
TASS.COM 
Russia and China need to create an autonomous financial system which would be minimally subject to political risks and external pressure, Russian Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev said in an interview with the Chinese Central Television (CCTV). 
‚ÄúAs I see it, what should we be guided with in creating a modern financial system in the People‚Äôs Republic of China and in the Russian Federation?‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúWe need to set up a modern, protected and simultaneously quite autonomous financial system, which would be subject to political risks to a lesser degree.‚Äù Nowadays, Russia and China are considering integration of Russia‚Äôs national payment system, the Mir bank cards, and China‚Äôs UnionPay system, he said. 
‚ÄúIn our view, it would help to enhance the reliability of payments,‚Äù Medvedev said, adding that sometimes some countries were trying to exert ‚Äúall sorts of political pressure.‚Äù European banks had been regularly fined by US financial authorities and financial companies, he added. 
‚ÄúThey say ‚ÄòWe will take ten billion euros from a French bank and seven billion euros from a German bank‚Äô. Our European partners agree with this,‚Äù Medvedev said. 
‚ÄúI am not speaking about the nature of these disputes but that we must protect our financial systems. China must protect its own system and Russia must protect its own system. Therefore, this cooperation is very useful as in this situation no-one will be capable of blocking the road of financial traffic,‚Äù he emphasized. Russia looks to predictability of China‚Äôs economic growth 
Russia expects that China‚Äôs economic growth will be predictable and is set to cooperate with Chinese partners for the purpose, Russia‚Äôs Prime Minister said in an interview. 
‚ÄúWe are interested in predictability of China‚Äôs economy growth and so we are ready to work with our Chinese partners,‚Äù Medvedev said, adding the Russian government was implementing a plan aimed to boost the economic growth. 
‚ÄúActually, everyone needs it. Our country needs it as recently we have been plunged in a phase of such decline. Both European and US economies need it since they have not been gaining fast growth, to say nothing about Japan. Also, the Chinese economy needs it since it had been gathering speed in the past years but has slowed down later,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúIt is closely watched by everyone as China‚Äôs economy is the most significant factor of the world economic growth.‚Äù. Energy and high technology sectors 
Russia and China may reach the goal of $200bln trade by 2020 but energy and high technology sectors along with traditional trade should move up a gear, Russian Prime Minister said. 
‚ÄúIndicators have been improving this year as a result of joint work of the two states, including our countries‚Äô leaders, governments, ministries, agencies and businesses,‚Äù Medvedev said. Russia, China intend to develop small satellite for Wi-Fi network 
‚ÄúI am convinced that if we move ahead like this, by 2020 we will be able to reach the trade of $200 billion worth. However, attention should be turned to key aspects of cooperation,‚Äù he said explaining he implied the energy sector, with some projects like the Power of Siberia gas pipeline. 
‚ÄúIn 2015 construction of an eastern stretch of the gas pipeline was launched,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúAlso, it includes oil supplies along the Skovorodino-Mohe (oil pipeline) extension and construction of large facilities, in particular the construction of Unit 3 at the Tianwan Nuclear Power Plant.‚Äù 
Besides, high-tech projects should be enhanced, he said. 
‚ÄúI mean wide-body jets, heavy helicopters and other projects in the high-tech sector,‚Äù Medvedev said. ‚ÄúIt seems to me that if we diversify trade like this, our countries will be quite capable of reaching the level which we agreed on several years ago,‚Äù he said in conclusion. Share",1
Worst Of Saudi Economic Slump Yet To Come,"Worst Of Saudi Economic Slump Yet To Come 11/07/2016 
PRESS TV 
Experts say the outlook for Saudi economic recovery will remain murky for many months to come with some even warning that the worst of the economic slump for the kingdom is yet to come. 
Reuters in a report quoted several Riyadh-based experts as saying that there would be a high degree of uncertainty over the status of the Saudi economy in 2017. That would mainly be a result of the remaining challenges from the private sector. 
The Saudi economy may appear to have escaped a fiscal and currency crisis that loomed at the start of 2016. However, experts said, threats from certain basic problems still remain and will haunt the kingdom next year. 
The government owes its success to temporarily escape crisis to unpaid bills rather than sustainable spending cuts. 
The government has reduced or suspended payments that it owed to construction firms, medical establishments and even some of the foreign consultants who helped to design the economic reforms, Reuters added quoting the experts. The estimated unpaid dues for construction firms alone totaled 80 billion riyals. 
Experts further warned that this could store up obligations for Riyadh in the future. 
Reuters elsewhere emphasized that signs of the economic slump could be seen in Riyadh and other major cities, where discounts of 50 percent or more are offered by stores selling clothes and consumer electronics, and there is a surge in people offering second-hand cars for sale. 
The biggest uncertainty may be how authorities can push through a key part of their reform drive, added the report. The most important issue for the Saudis may be determining how they plan to foster a vibrant private sector that does not depend on oil revenues while at the same pushing ahead austerity policies that are suppressing private demand. 
Experts also warned that the status of the Saudi job market over the next few years. Between 1 million and 2 million of Saudi Arabia‚Äôs 10 million foreign workers may leave over the next couple of years as the economic slowdown causes lay-offs and the government seeks to steer Saudi citizens into jobs previously held by foreigners, Reuters added.",1

US Military Prepares To Shut Down Russia‚Äôs Internet If It Hacks The Election,"US Military Prepares To Shut Down Russia‚Äôs Internet If It Hacks The Election 11/08/2016 
DAILY CALLER 
American hackers recently broke into Russia‚Äôs communications networks, electrical grid and government systems in preparation for a retaliatory cyber strike should Russian hackers meddle in the U.S. election, according to NBC News. 
Officials do not expect any major attacks on U.S. infrastructure, which would be tantamount to an act of war, but they are concerned that Russian hackers may meddle in the election by spreading false information. The hacker ‚ÄúGuccifer 2.0‚Äù ‚Äî which officials and some cyber security experts believe is a front for Russian intelligence ‚Äî claimed they would be monitoring elections ‚Äúfrom inside the system.‚Äù 
The U.S. preparations are no different than Russia and China‚Äôs probing of U.S. networks. The penetration caused no damage to Russia, instead it was the equivalent of a military scouting mission. Cyber weapons could be deployed if the U.S. suffered a significant attack, but officials tell NBC News that is an unlikely scenario. Just to be sure though, Obama administration officials issued a back-channel warning to Russia to stay out of the election. 
‚ÄúYou‚Äôd gain access to a network, you‚Äôd establish your presence on the network and then you‚Äôre poised to do what you would like to do with the network,‚Äù Gary Brown, a former legal adviser to U.S. Cyber Command (CYBERCOM), told NBC News. 
U.S. cyber capabilities are top of the line, but the Obama administration has been wary of deploying them, despite consistent Russian provocation. CYBERCOM and the National Security Agency, the agencies responsible for U.S. cyber security, are incredibly secretive regarding U.S. capabilities. Stuxnet is the most well-known, publicized U.S. cyber weapon. The highly advanced computer worm wreaked havoc on Iran‚Äôs nuclear enrichment program in 2010. 
CYBERCOM is currently involved in cyber attacks against the Islamic State, but Pentagon officials have been especially silent on the exact details of the ‚Äú cyber bombs ‚Äù being dropped on the terrorist group. Russia may find itself the next target, should it decide to go from misinformation campaigns to attacks on infrastructure.",1

NATO fighter jets on constant watch for Russian jets above Baltic states,"NATO fighter jets on constant watch for Russian jets above Baltic states 11/08/2016 
DAILY MAIL Russian fighter jets are constantly probing Nato‚Äôs defences over the Baltic states, with more than 600 ‚Äòinterceptions‚Äô so far this year. Ironically, considering the history, the Nato pilots defending the skies over Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania are often German. Seven German fighter pilots are based at an air base at Amari, west of the Estonian capital Tallinn. Lieutenant Colonel Swen Jacob, the commander of the German pilots, said they often flew as close as 10 yards from the Russian jets and one occasion a Russian pilot gave him a middle-fingered salute. Lt Col Jacob joked to the Washington Post : ‚ÄòMaybe he watched too much ‚ÄúTop Gun‚Äù.‚Äô But the situation in the Baltic is deadly serious, with the Russian air force clearly under orders from President Vladimir Putin to be more aggressive in the air. An RAF Eurofighter Typhoon plane takes off over a field of poppies. German Typhoons are currently based in Amari, Estonia, and it is possible they will be replaced by British Typhoons in January The Typhoon jet (left) is flown by the German air force and the RAF aswell as the Italian and Spanish air forces. It is matched in the air with the Russian Sukhoi SU-27 Flanker (right) The German pilots have scrambled 34 times since they were posted in Estonia on August 31, with Sukhoi SU-27 Flanker jets the most common threat. The Russian planes are free to fly along an international airspace corridor running between St Petersburg and the Kaliningrad enclave and west as far as the Danish island of Falster. Russian pilots often fly without transponders, making them virtually invisible and increasing the danger of mid-air collisions. Lt Col Jacob told the Post: ‚ÄòThe fighter aircraft are almost always armed to the teeth. Six kinds of missiles. They could carry up to 10.‚Äô This Sukhoi SU-27 Flanker showed off its abilities at the Farnborough air show a few years ago, before the icy blasts of the new cold war descended on Europe The Flanker‚Äôs full armoury includes Vympel R-27, R-73 and R-77 air-to-air missiles, Zvezda Kh-35U anti-ship missiles, S-8 and S-13 rockets and a collection of guided bombs and cluster bombs. The French air force also has four fighter jets based at ≈†iauliai in Lithuania. Both the French and German contingents are due to be rotated out of the area in January and replaced by other Nato pilots, including possibly RAF pilots from Britain. 
+20 Goodybe Mr President: Russia‚Äôs President Putin (left) has massively increased Russian military spending and anti-Western rhetoric and most experts agree he has outmanouevred President Obama (right) militarily and politically The Baltic states seized their independence from the collapsing Soviet Union in 1991 and, increasingly worried about the Russian bear on their doorstep, joined Nato in 2004. Putin was enraged that Nato was within 100 miles of Russia‚Äôs second city, St Petersburg, and in the last year he has been increasingly probing Nato‚Äôs defences in the region. Yesterday Nato chiefs announced plans to put together a force of 300,000 troops which they can put on ‚Äòhigh alert‚Äô in eastern Europe. Relations between Russia and the West have plunged in the last year, with Moscow‚Äôs insistence on backing its Syrian ally, President Bashar al-Assad, at all costs leading to serious tension with the US, Britain and France. Most Nato members cut their defence spending dramatically since the Soviet Union collapsed in 1991 but Russia has been bolstering its military capabilities, holding parades involving more than 100,000 troops each year. 
+20 Nato soldiers stand on a pontoon bridge constructed across the Vistula river in Poland during the NATO Anaconda-16 exercise earlier this year Moscow has been throwing its weight around in recent years ‚Äì in 2008 Russian troops humiliated the Georgians and in turn the White House by invading South Ossetia and Abkhazia in support of pro-Moscow rebels. Then in 2014 Russia annexed Crimea and supported ethnic Russian rebels in the eastern Ukraine. President Obama‚Äôs ‚ÄòRussian reset‚Äô policy, which was designed to improve relations with Moscow, has looked increasingly like a policy of appeasement. 
+20 At the weekend Russian soldiers, dressed in World War Two era uniforms, commemorate the 75th anniversary of a famous parade in 1941 when the Red Army headed out of Moscow to take on the Nazis Russia‚Äôs President Vladimir Putin has been accused of attempting to interfere with the US election process by hacking into the emails of senior members of the Democratic party and recently moved the Iskander nuclear-capable missiles into the Kaliningrad enclave, on the borders with Poland. But Nato members like Estonia, Poland and Romania, who are feeling increasingly threatened by Moscow, are now being promised a rapid deployment force. Nato Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg told The Times this week: ‚ÄòWe have also seen Russia using propaganda in Europe among Nato allies and that is exactly the reason why Nato is responding. We are responding with the biggest reinforcement of our collective defence since the end of the Cold War. ‚ÄòWe have seen Russia being much more active in many different ways. ‚ÄòWe have seen a more assertive Russia implementing a substantial military build-up over many years; tripling defence spending since 2000 in real terms; developing new military capabilities; exercising their forces and using military force against neighbours,‚Äô added Mr Stoltenberg. 
+20 Russia recently moved its nuclear-capable Iskander missiles into the Kaliningrad enclave. The missiles could take out targets in Berlin Britain‚Äôs permanent representative to Nato, Sir Adam Thomson, told The Times it would currently take Nato six months to deploy a force of 300,000, which was simply too slow. At the weekend British military intelligence officers issued a warning over a new Russian ‚Äòsuper tank‚Äô which they claim is far superior to anything which is available to Nato. The document claims that Britain‚Äôs Challenger II main battle tank could be overpowered by the Kremlin‚Äôs new Armata tank. Officials believe the new Russian tank is ‚Äòrevolutionary‚Äô and blames the government for failing to provide a proper response. The new tank has several highly advanced features including an un-manned turret which makes the machine safer for crews Yesterday‚Äôs military parade in Red Square commemorated a pivotal moment in World War Two when German forces were turned back from the gates of Moscow",1

Trump Tower Surrounded By Dump Trucks In Anticipation Of Violence,"Trump Tower Surrounded By Dump Trucks In Anticipation Of Violence 11/09/2016 
DAILY CALLER 
The New York City Police Department (NYPD) has surrounded the perimeter of Trump Tower with reinforced dump trucks in anticipation of Election Day violence. 
The dump trucks flank the skyscraper on all sides, and are supplemented by guardrails and heavily armed police officers. This morning, the building was not open to the general public and traffic crawled through a narrow corridor of trucks and police. On the street, supporters and protesters stood for interviews with a burgeoning press corps camped across the street. Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump lives in a penthouse near the top of the building, which also serves as headquarters for his presidential campaign. (RELATED: Election Day Voting Has Begun ‚Äì Who Is Winning?) 
Police told The Daily Caller News Foundation that the dumping beds are filled with sand, which adds weight to each truck, in effect making it impossible to run the barrier. Police decided to circle the Tower with trucks as a hedge against car bombs, or some such similar incendiary munition delivered by car. The fleet of trucks will travel with Trump this evening to surround the New York Hilton Midtown Manhattan Hotel, where Trump is hosting his victory rally. The NYPD maintained a presence around the hotel for several days, which is also closed to the public. 
Guests staying in the hotel on unrelated business must present their keycards at a security check-point before entering the premises. 
Similar security measures will attend Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton‚Äôs headquarters at the Javits Convention Center in Hell‚Äôs Kitchen this evening.",1

Elites Have Secretly ‚ÄúBanked On Trump Victory,"Elites Have Secretly ‚ÄúBanked On Trump Victory 11/09/2016 
SILVERISTHENEW 
There‚Äôs more than one way for the establishment to yield power from this election. 
The first path is obvious, direct and potentially deadly. A Hillary presidency will be surrounded by bitter people, and overt uses of power, along with war, increased taxes and thinly-veiled pay-for-play politics benefiting the billionaires who‚Äôve bankrolled her rise to power. 
The other path is less predictable, but possible just the perfect ‚Äúmagic formula‚Äù they need to get things flowing again. 
The Brexit vote, a by-product of populist anger against economic stagnation and political angst, was secretly a win for those who wield power from the financial sector. 
In the end, the disquiet of the people has proven to be the secret ingredient to stirring something up in an economy otherwise stymied by quantitative easing and dismal economic returns. 
As Zero Hedge explains , it just may be, particularly in light of some of the statements that have been made by significant figures on Wall Street: 
So yes, inflation is possible, it just can‚Äôt coexist with political stability, which may explain why ‚Äì according to some more conspiratorial elements ‚Äì a ‚Äúsurprising‚Äù Trump victory on Tuesday may be assured : after all, what better way to unleash political instability than to inaugurate the candidate who promises a full break with the establishment as we know it. If in the process, it leads to a surge in much needed inflation, now that QE has tried and failed, it‚Äôs a price the establishment, reeling under the weight of record global debt, is willing to pay. 
One River Asset Management‚Äôs Eric Peters laying out his inflationary ‚Äúrevelation‚Äù: ‚ÄúBritish spenders have entirely looked through post-Brexit uncertainty,‚Äù said Mark Carney [governor of the Bank of England]. ‚Ä¶ So the Bank of England forecast its biggest inflation overshoot since 1997; expecting 2018 price gains to peak at +2.8%. What‚Äôs it tell us? 
A populist uprising, compromised free trade, immigration restrictions, a 15% currency devaluation, 0.50% interest rates combined with aggressive QE is today‚Äôs magic formula for modestly exceeding a 2% inflation target 2yrs hence. 
[‚Ä¶]we live in the 2010s, and inflationary expectations have succumbed to decades of independent central banking. Economic volatility is remarkably muted too. With it has come a long period of political stability. [‚Ä¶] And we also know that a long period of political stability is drawing to a close. 
But we can‚Äôt be sure that political volatility will increase inflation volatility. Nor can we be sure that it won‚Äôt. It all depends on time and place. And today‚Äôs time and place is something new. 
Is this proof that the elite are secretly planning to make lemonade from the lemons of American discontent and the wild card candidacy of Donald Trump? 
That is a difficult call to make, but it is worth noting that there is clearly an advantage to be held if this outcome does occur. 
As Tumelar notes, the fix is in either way: 
It‚Äôs either inflation by Trump‚Äôs victory or by WW3 started by Hillary Clinton. 
A hard choice for the banksters. 
Of course, the situation is much more complicated than just inflation, or any one factor. There is a great deal of speculation that the end of QE, known to be no longer effective at stimulating the economy has made a stock market collapse inevitable, subject to the Fed raises rates. 
It appears that Yellen has been waiting for the outcome of the election, and one way or another, will dump the next crisis on the next president. If that proves to be Trump, he will be blamed for the downfall‚Ä¶ meanwhile, there will be those waiting in the shadows to profit from disaster. 
For his part, astute columnist Brandon Smith has consistently argued that the elite have chosen Trump and will allow him to take the presidency ‚Äì only to use the unpredictability as a catalyst for order out of chaos, and the institution of great political and economic controls over the country: 
The vast majority of analysts in the mainstream and in the alternative media refused to acknowledge the possibility that a successful Brexit actually works in FAVOR of the globalists, because it provides them a perfect scapegoat for a financial crisis that has been broiling for years and is now ready to burst into flames. 
[‚Ä¶] 
I argue that the globalists want Trump in office, just as they wanted the passage of the Brexit. I argue that they need conservative movements to feel as though we have won, so that they can pull the rug out from under us in the near future. I argue that we are being set up. 
Again, the elites are openly telling us what is about to happen. They are telling us that if ‚Äúpopulists‚Äù (conservatives) gain political power, the system will effectively collapse. To what extent is hard to say, but let‚Äôs assume that the situation will be ugly enough to influence the masses to reconsider the ideal of globalism as a possible solution. The elites are fond of the Hegelian dialectic and the philosophy of ‚Äúorder out of chaos,‚Äù after all. 
Again, the reasons parallel the reasons that Brexit was able to succeed in spite of fierce establishment opposition. 
The master manipulators are adaptive to any market conditions, and their influence runs deeper than the electorate of any given political season. Its agents and officers instruct the candidates and make demands, not the other way around. 
In a puppeteer‚Äôs world, must we always argue for the existence of puppets on every stage?

CNN Exposed: Using Own Camera-Man For Story as Trump Protester,"By: Seasonal via abovetopsecret.com

Pipeline Billionaire Who Militarized Police at Standing Rock,"Pipeline Billionaire Who Militarized Police at Standing Rock 11 Shares Email 
The months long Dakota Access Keystone XL pipleine protest at the Standing Rock Indian Reservation by Native Americans and those sympathetic to protection of our water supply has been met with heavy-handed and brutal clamp down by police and national guard. Militarized goons in battle dress have stormed protector camps with LRAD sonic weapons, attack dogs , tear gas, tazers , and even live ammunition ( killing horses ), while politicians and mainstream media do their best to ignore this growing atrocity, hoping to wait it out until the protestors give up. 
But, as the saying goes, Water Is Life , and the issue of life and death is at the root of this protection movement, therefore, for people concerned with life, giving up on this is simply unthinkable. The root issue justifying state oppression of the protest is capitalism, and the perception that money is more important than life itself. When the police and national guard attack U.S. citizens on private property to protect corporate interests, who are they really working for? 
The corporate dream of the Keystone XL pipeline is to create a profit stream for a small number of people at the expense of the natural world and anyone in the way. At the top of this pyramid of profit is Texas billionaire Kelcy Warren, CEO of Energy Transfer Partners, the company responsible for the project. 
So who is Kelcy Warren? 
A native of East Texas and graduate of the University of Texas at Arlington with a degree in civil engineering, Warren worked in the natural gas industry and became co-chair of Energy Transfer Equity in 2007. With business partner Ray Davis, co-owner of the Texas Rangers baseball team, Warren built Energy Transfer Equity into one of the nation‚Äôs largest pipeline companies, which now owns about 71,000 miles of pipelines carrying natural gas, natural gas liquids, refined products and crude oil. The company‚Äôs holdings include Sunoco, Southern Union and Regency Energy Partners. 
Forbes estimates the 60-year-old Warren‚Äôs personal wealth at $4 billion. Bloomberg described him as ‚Äúamong America‚Äôs new shale tycoons‚Äù ‚Äî but rather than building a fortune by drilling he ‚Äútakes the stuff others pull from underground and moves it from one place to another, chilling, boiling, pressurizing, and processing it until it‚Äôs worth more than when it burst from the wellhead.‚Äù [ Source ] 
Shockingly, in 2015 the governor of Texas, Greg Abbott, appointed Warren to the Texas Parks and Wildlife Commission which is an insult to environmentalists working to protect Big Bend National Park and surrounding sacred tribal lands from another $770 million pipeline project . 
‚ÄúAccording to the governor‚Äôs office, the state parks and wildlife commission ‚Äúmanages and conserves the natural and cultural resources of Texas,‚Äù along with ensuring the future of hunting, fishing and outdoor recreation opportunities for Texans.‚Äù [ Source ] 
This glaring conflict of interest has inspired Environmental Science major at UTSA and former Texas State Park Ambassador Andrew Lucas to begin a drive to have Warren removed from this environmental post. His petition is described here : 
Most people may know Kelcy Warren as the man behind the controversial Dakota Access Pipeline. The Dallas-based billionaire and CEO of Energy Transfer Partners has been making headlines for fast-tracking a 1100 mile crude oil pipeline across the Midwest and under the Missouri River, just north of the Standing Rock Sioux Reservation. No environmental impact assessment, no respect for cultural sites, and no regard for the local and widespread communities living along the river. A similar story is unfolding out in West Texas, where Warren‚Äôs company has split through the pristine Big Bend region with the 200 mile Comanche Trail Pipeline and nearly-complete 143 mile Trans Pecos Pipeline. These Pipelines mark the way for massive natural gas and oil developments in the Trans Pecos region. 
With untold damages unfolding for cultural and environmental resources at the hands of Energy Transfer Partners, it would surprise most to know that nearly a year ago, Texas Governor Greg Abbott appointed Kelcy Warren for a 6 year term as 1 of the 10 commissioners who preside over Texas Parks And Wildlife‚Ä¶ Why? Probably the $550,000 in campaign contributions Abbott received from Warren.

"Capitalism Is Doomed ‚Äî Without Alternatives, So Are We","‚ÄòThough it appears as if rumors of capitalism‚Äôs imminent demise have been greatly exaggerated,‚Äô writes Johnson, ‚Äòthere is good reason to believe that its remarkable ability to adapt and evolve in the face of frequent (self-induced) shocks has reached a breaking point.‚Äô In 1946, George Orwell pondered the fragility of the capitalist order.
Reviewing the work of the influential theorist James Burnham, Orwell presaged several concepts that would later form the groundwork for his best-known novel, 1984.
‚ÄúNot only is the best of capitalism behind us, but the worst of it may lie just ahead.‚Äù
In his book The Managerial Revolution , Burnham envisioned, as Orwell put it , ‚Äúa new kind of planned, centralised society which will be neither capitalist nor, in any accepted sense of the word, democratic. The rulers of this new society will be the people who effectively control the means of production.‚Äù
‚ÄúThe real question,‚Äù Orwell adds, ‚Äúis not whether the people who wipe their boots on us during the next fifty years are to be called managers, bureaucrats, or politicians: the question is whether capitalism, now obviously doomed, is to give way to oligarchy or to true democracy.‚Äù
While Orwell was wary of Burnham‚Äôs worldview and of his more specific predictions, he agreed that the relationship between capitalism and democracy has always been, and always will be, a precarious one.
‚ÄúFor quite fifty years past,‚Äù Orwell noted, ‚Äúthe general drift has almost certainly been towards oligarchy.‚Äù
Pointing to the concentration of political and economic power in the hands of the few and acknowledging ‚Äúthe weakness of the proletariat against the centralised state,‚Äù Orwell was far from optimistic about the future ‚Äî but he was quite certain that the economic status quo would eventually give way.
Recent events, and the material circumstances of much of the world‚Äôs population, have prompted serious examinations of the same questions Orwell was considering seven decades ago. And though it appears as if rumors of capitalism‚Äôs imminent demise have been greatly exaggerated, there is good reason to believe that its remarkable ability to adapt and evolve in the face of frequent (self-induced) shocks has reached a breaking point.
Widespread discontent over stagnant incomes and the uneven prosperity brought about by neoliberal globalization has, in 2016, come to a head in striking fashion; Donald Trump, Brexit, and the rise of far-right parties in Europe have many questioning previously sacred assumptions.
‚ÄúIs the marriage between liberal democracy and global capitalism an enduring one?‚Äù asked Martin Wolf, a formidable commentator in one of the world‚Äôs leading business papers, the Financial Times .
This was no rhetorical softball; Wolf is genuinely concerned that the winners of globalization have grown complacent, that they have ‚Äútaken for granted‚Äù a couple that was only tenuously compatible to begin with. He also worries, rightly, that they have downplayed the concerns of the ‚Äúlosers.‚Äù
Wolf concludes that ‚Äúif the legitimacy of our democratic political systems is to be maintained, economic policy must be orientated towards promoting the interests of the many not the few; in the first place would be the citizenry, to whom the politicians are accountable.‚Äù
Not all members of the commentariat share Wolf‚Äôs willingness to engage with these cherished assumptions, however. Indeed, many analysts have reserved their ire not for failing institutions or policies but for the public, reviving Walter Lippmann‚Äôs characterization of the masses as a ‚Äúbewildered herd‚Äù that, if left to its own devices, is sure to usher in a regime of chaos.
‚ÄúIt‚Äôs time,‚Äù declared Foreign Policy ‚Äòs James Traub, channeling the sentiments of Josh Barro, ‚Äúfor the elites to rise up against the ignorant masses.‚Äù
Apologists like Traub and Barro ‚Äî just two among many ‚Äî speak and write as if the leash previously restraining the ‚Äúherd‚Äù has been loosened, and that the resulting freedom has laid bare what elitists have long believed to be the case: To use Barro‚Äôs infamous words , ‚ÄúElites are usually elite for good reason, and tend to have better judgment than the average person.‚Äù They point to the rise of Donald Trump as evidence of an intolerable democratic surplus ‚Äî evidence, in short, of what the masses will do if granted a loud enough voice.
Aside from being conveniently self-serving, this narrative is also false.
Far from loosening the leash, elites have consolidated power to an unprecedented extent , and they have used their influence to undercut democratic movements and hijack public institutions. The resulting concentration of wealth and political power is jarring, and it puts the lie to the farcical notion that elites are a persecuted minority.
But, in the midst of these anti-democratic diatribes, fascinating and important critiques of a rather different nature have emerged.
‚ÄúFar from loosening the leash, elites have consolidated power to an unprecedented extent , and they have used their influence to undercut democratic movements and hijack public institutions.‚Äù
Instead of urging us to align Against Democracy , to use the name of a recent book by the libertarian political philosopher Jason Brennan, many are arguing that it is capitalism, and not the excesses of the democratic process, that has provided figures like Trump a launching pad.
In his book Postcapitalism , Paul Mason argues that the rapid emergence of information technology has corroded the boundaries of the market; ‚Äúcapitalism,‚Äù he insists, ‚Äúhas reached the limits of its capacity to adapt.‚Äù And its attempts to reach beyond these limits have fostered an economic environment defined by instability, crippling austerity for the many, and rapid accumulation of wealth for the few.
According to Oxfam, the global 1 percent now owns as much wealth as the bottom 99 percent. CEO pay has continued to soar. And though post-crisis reforms have carried soaring promises of stability, the financial sector is still far too large , and many of the banks harmed by the crash they created are back and nearly as powerful as ever .",1
Wikileaks Releases First Batch Of Barack Obama Emails & They Hint At A Rigged Election,"By: Arjun Walia via collective-evolution.com
WikiLeaks just released their newest batch of leaked emails, and they contain messages sent to and from Barack Obama prior to his presidential inauguration.
The most interesting of the emails in this batch involves a message from John Podesta to Obama regarding an invitation from President George W. Bush to then ‚ÄòPresident-Elect‚Äô. It alluded to a transition plan that was being worked on before the election took place.
According to the memo, Obama was already discussing his transition into office with the then-Treasury Secretary Hank Paulson. Here is a statement taken from a memo sent from the transition board to Barack Obama:
As you have observed in your interactions with Secretary Paulson, he is apparently eager to involve you and your transition team extensively in his policy choices following the election.
Immediately after the election Secretary Paulson and other members of the Administration will likely seek to involve you and your transition team in their ongoing policy responses to the financial and housing crises. We also expect relentless interest from the press and public about your intended level of engagement with the Administration on these matters during the transition.
Think about this for a second, Obama‚Äôs transition was already being discussed with certain members of the Bush administration. Also, judging by the email, it‚Äôs clear that it was known that Obama was going to be the president.
Another telling email, dated October 30, 2008, came from John Podesta to the then Senator Obama discussing an economic transition team, and why Obama needed to get the wheels in motion before his term begins.",1

Putin blasts Clinton & Tells U.S. Govt to STOP Criticizing Russia,"In the clip ‚Äì filmed in Russia ‚Äì Putin, 64, tells a group of journalists that the US is creating a ‚Äúdistraction‚Äù aiming ‚Äúto distract voters from the country‚Äôs problems‚Äù by creating ‚Äúan enemy and uniting the nation against them‚Äù.

"The Many ""Truths"" on Syria: How Our Rivalry Has Destroyed a Country","In Syria, the only ‚Äútruth‚Äù that all parties seem to agree upon is that hundreds of thousands are dead and Syria is shattered.
‚ÄúThe United States has the power to decree the death of nations,‚Äù wrote Stephen Kinzer in the Boston Globe.
Kinzer‚Äôs article was entitled: ‚Äú The media are misleading the public on Syria .‚Äù In his piece, the scholar at a Brown University Institute contested that his country‚Äôs media misinformation on Syria is leading to the kind of ignorance which is enabling the American government to pursue any policy, however imprudent, in the war-torn Arab country.
The US government can ‚Äòdecree the death of nations‚Äô with ‚Äúpopular support because many Americans ‚Äî and many journalists ‚Äî are content with the official story,‚Äù he wrote.
Kinzer, in principle makes a strong point. His article, however, was particularly popular among those who sees the Syrian government entirely innocent of any culpability in the ongoing war, and that Iran and Russia are at no fault whatsoever; better yet, their intervention in Syria is entirely morally-guided and altruistic.
That said, Kinzer‚Äôs assertion regarding the US government‚Äôs dangerous meddling in Syria‚Äôs affairs, renewed Cold War with Russia and ill-defined military mission in that country, is all true.
Neither is the US, nor its western and other allies, following rules of war nor adhering to a particularly noble set of principles aimed at ending that most devastating war, which has killed well over 300,000 people , rendered millions displaced and destroyed the country‚Äôs wealth and infrastructure.
So what is the truth on Syria?
In the last five and a half years, since a regional uprising turned into an armed rebellion‚Äîturned into civil, regional and international war‚Äî‚Äôthe truth on Syria‚Äô, has been segmented into many self-tailored ‚Äòtruths,‚Äô each promoted by one of the warring party to be the one and only, absolute and uncontested reality. But since there are many parties to the conflict, the versions of the ‚Äòtruth‚Äô communicated to us via copious media, are numerous and, most often, unverifiable.
The only truth that all parties seem to agree upon is that hundreds of thousands are dead and Syria is shattered. But, of course, each points to the other side for culpability of the ongoing genocide.
An oddly refreshing, although disturbing ‚Äòtruth‚Äô was articulated by Alon Ben-David in the Israeli Jerusalem Post last year.
The title of his article speaks volumes: ‚Äú May it never end: The uncomfortable truth about the war in Syria .‚Äù
‚ÄúIf Israel‚Äôs interest in the war in Syria can be summarized in brief, it would be: That it should never end,‚Äù Ben-David wrote.
‚ÄúNo one will say this publicly, but the continuation of the fighting in Syria, as long as there is a recognized authority in Damascus, allows Israel to stay out of the swamp and distance itself from the swarms of mosquitoes that are buzzing in it.‚Äù Of course, Israel never truly ‚Äòstayed out of the swamp‚Äô , but that is for a separate discussion.",1
New French Law Makes It Illegal To Contact Employees After Work Hours,"By Amanda Froelich at trueactivist.com

Russian Researchers Discover Secret Nazi Military Base ‚ÄòTreasure Hunter‚Äô in the Arctic [Photos],"The mystery surrounding The Third Reich and Nazi Germany is still a subject of debate between many observers. Some believe that Nazi Germany, under the control of Adolf Hitler, possessed supernatural powers, and largely employed pseudo-science during the 1933-1945 period. However, some also hold that the above belief is just a mere speculation without any proven fact. Over the years, researchers have searched extensively for answers to some of the more mysterious activities associated with Nazi Germany.
Nazi Germany invaded Russia (formerly the USSR) during the Second World War on June 22, 1941. At the time, the German army progressed deep into Russian territory, gaining ground close to the capital Moscow, before the Russians could counter-attack, eventually driving the Nazis back.
During the Nazi occupation in Russia, in 1942, the Nazis built a secret military base around the Arctic, code-named ‚ÄúSchatzgraber‚Äù or ‚ÄúTreasure Hunter,‚Äù which was reportedly very instrumental in the war against Russia. The base was primarily used as a tactical weather station for planning the strategic movements of Nazi troops, warships and submarines. The base also housed eminent Nazi scientists, whom conducted many experiments to help progress a German win of the war. It was widely speculated at the time that the Nazis used the base to contact aliens or extraterrestrial beings. The controversial Ahnenerbe was even linked to the base. The Ahnenerbe was an institute in Nazi Germany. Responsible for researching archaeological and cultural history of the Aryan race, it is rumored to have had heavy occult influences. Founded on July 1, 1935, by Heinrich Himmler, Herman Wirth and Richard Walther Darr√©, the Ahnenerbe later conducted experiments and launched expeditions in attempts to prove that mythological Nordic populations had once ruled the world.
However, the Nazis abandoned the base in 1944 ‚Äì a time when the Russian army began its offensive, pushing the Germans out of the country. According to a war-time story, supplies had dwindled to dangerously low levels, and the Nazi officers stationed at the base outpost were forced to kill and eat polar bear, which ultimately, was infected with trichinosis. This caused those stationed at the base to fall severely ill and eventually they required rescue by a German U-boat. Despite Russian authors telling the story of ‚ÄúTreasure Hunter,‚Äù some observers consider it a myth, doubting its existence.
But Russian researchers have now announced that ‚ÄúTreasure Hunter‚Äù has been discovered, saying the base is on the island of Alexandra Land in the Arctic Circle, located 620 miles from the North Pole.
A senior researcher at the Russian Arctic National Park, Evgeny Ermolov said in a statement announcing the discovery : ‚ÄúBefore it was only known from written sources, but now we also have real proof.‚Äù",1
Anonymous Online Vigilante Group Helps Jail a Pedophile,"An online vigilante group in the United Kingdom, the Internet Interceptors, has helped the law deal with a 33-year-old pedophile who was planning to lure a 14-year-old girl to have sex with him in north London. The pedophile, Richard Ganyata, is said to be a Rugby player at Saracens Amateur RFC. It‚Äôs thought that he had met the underage 14-year-old girl online, proposing to have sex with her at his residence.
In a video chat with the supposed underage girl, Ganyata claimed to be 23-years-old. He told the girl that he lived at the club house of his rugby team. He then proposed that the girl visit him for sex, instructing the girl that if she arrives at the club house, she should pretend she was just his little sister‚Äôs friend.
He also told the girl how he planned to lay with her on the sofa, describing in detail what he would do to her during sex. The positive response from the girl excited Ganyata, who was looking forward to having a good time with the underage girl.
But unbeknownst to the pedophile, he had spoken to members of the Internet Interceptors instead ‚Äì the team who dedicate their time to hunting down pedophiles on the Internet.
When the day came for the pedophile to meet the girl as planned, he went to pick her up, but rather than meet with her, he was confronted by members of the Internet Interceptors, who immediately called the police. The vigilante group filmed their meeting with the pedophile on camera.
A member of the group asked the pedophile: ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre here to meet a 14-year-girl aren‚Äôt you, Richard?‚Äù
He replied: ‚ÄúI wasn‚Äôt really sure about it.‚Äù",1

Researchers Accidentally Find Simple Way to Convert Harmful CO2 Gas to Green Energy,"In the scientific world, there is something called serendipity. The word is used to denote the occurrence or invention of something beneficial by chance. For years, governments and climate change activists have struggled to convince the world to cut down on greenhouse emissions. A greenhouse gas is any gaseous compound in the atmosphere that is capable of absorbing infrared radiation, thereby trapping and holding heat in the atmosphere. By increasing the heat in the atmosphere, greenhouse gases are responsible for the greenhouse effect, which ultimately leads to global warming.
Carbon dioxide (CO2) is one of the gases that are responsible for global warming. CO2 is a byproduct of fuel consumption. Apart from it being harmful to the atmosphere, it also has devastating consequences on human health, mainly through respiratory diseases.
In the past, researchers have attempted to convert this fuel byproduct back into energy, for future use. As the experiments proved unsuccessful, researchers were hoping that one day their dream would eventually come true. And indeed, it did. Unexpectedly.
Researchers from the Oak Ridge National Laboratory, Tennessee, United States, have announced that they have accidentally discovered a catalyst that is capable of transforming CO2 gas into high yields of ethanol . The discovery has been accepted and published in the online journal ChemistrySelect .
According to the researchers, they can do this without the use of rare and expensive elements such as platinum; with the process said to be very cheap and efficient.
The good news is, the new energy produced from the CO2 is said to be environmentally friendly. Developing the new fuel could significantly boost the already booming renewable energy industry.
The researchers have suggested that their new process could be combined with other renewables, such as solar or wind power, in order to efficiently harness those energy sources. Excess electricity produced by wind and solar is often lost when it is stored in batteries. However, by applying this new discovery, the researchers said the excess electricity could be used to produce ethanol to power solar factories and turbines when there is insufficient sun or wind energy. This method will cut down the costs of production for factory owners, ultimately benefiting the entire world.",1

Once again, the repression of those against the Dakota Access Pipeline (DAPL) is heating up, with 127 activists arrested in North Dakota over the weekend. However, North Dakota isn‚Äôt the only place where protests over the Dakota Access pipeline are coming to a head. In Iowa, farmers have had their land seized by the company behind the pipeline, Energy Transfer Partners, through the use of eminent domain. Eminent domain has been legal in the US since 1888, thanks to the passage of the Condemnation Act . The law authorizes the federal government to take private property for public use. However, in 1906, the law was amended to allow for the seizure of private property even if it only benefited private parties (e.g., corporations), not the public. The argument for this was that corporate seizure of private land ‚Äúhelps‚Äù the public through economic development. Yet, what the law essentially means is that even your own land doesn‚Äôt belong to you if the government or government-supported corporations want it.
A sad, yet accurate example of eminent domain gone wrong took place last week in Calhoun County, Iowa. Cyndy Coppola was arrested over the weekend on her own property for trying to block access to DAPL trucks from hauling pipeline construction materials through her land. DAPL first received access to Coppola‚Äôs farm through the use of eminent domain, which granted Energy Transfer Partners easements to her property. Coppola remarked that watching the morally wrong seizure of the farm she worked so hard for was difficult to handle.",1

‚ÄòDillary Trumplon‚Äô: This Guy‚Äôs Epic Rap Song Just Destroyed Trump AND Hillary,"By Nick Bernabe at theantimedia.org
The 2016 election has been one for the record books. Somehow, two of the most reviled people in the United States have become the frontrunners for the most powerful job in the country ‚Äî and the world.
On one hand, there is Donald Trump , the compulsively lying demagogic womanizing egomaniacal billionaire. On the other hand, there is Hillary Clinton, the infinitely corrupt influence peddling war-starter who allegedly cheated her way to the top of the Democratic Party while leaving a number of victims in her wake.
A significant portion of young people would actually prefer that a giant, apocalyptic meteor hit the earth rather than see Hillary Clinton or Donald Trump elected president.
It‚Äôs not all bad, though ‚Äî at least when it comes to the creative art that has been inspired by this nightmare of an election. One such example is ‚ÄúDillary Trumplon,‚Äù a recently released rap song written and performed by Blaise Guerra that‚Äôs starting to go viral on social media. From Trump‚Äôs demagoguery to Hillary‚Äôs war mongering, Guerra leaves no stone unturned.
Listen to the song for yourself, then check out our interview with Blaise below (his responses have been slightly edited and condensed for clarity).
AM: What inspired you to make this song? Blaise: I was inspired to make the song because I felt very disenfranchised by the way Bernie Sanders sparked such an incredible movement but was completely ignored by the media and given no shot. Yet according to Election Justice USA , without the primaries being fixed, Sanders could have won by a landslide. I felt so cheated when he lost. I knew the Democratic establishment had completely undermined the meaning of democracy and stolen the nomination from him.",1

Hillary Admits In Leaked Email That Clinton Donors Are Funding ISIS,"By Alice Salles at theantimedia.org
In an email between Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton and her campaign chairman, John Podesta, the former first lady and secretary of state cites ‚Äú Western intelligence, US intelligence and sources in the region ‚Äù to accuse Qatar and Saudi Arabia of ‚Äú providing clandestine financial and logistic support to ISIL [or ISIS] and other radical Sunni groups in the region .‚Äù
Citing the need to ‚Äú use our diplomatic and more traditional intelligence assets ,‚Äù the candidate told Podesta the current developments in the Middle East were ‚Äú important to the U.S. for reasons that often differ from country to country .‚Äù In the same email, Clinton seemed to claim Turkey needed to be reassured of America‚Äôs willingness to ‚Äú take serious actions, ‚Äù an effort that ‚Äú [could] be sustained to protect our national interests ‚Äù in the region.
In another piece of correspondence from 2012, the Director of Foreign Policy at the Clinton Foundation, Amitabh Desai , claimed the Ambassador from Qatar would ‚Äú like to see [Bill Clinton] ‚Äòfor five minutes‚Äô in NYC, to present $1 million check that Qatar promised for [his] birthday in 2011 ,‚Äù adding that the small but rich nation occupying the Qatar Peninsula would ‚Äú welcome [the Clinton Foundation‚Äôs] suggestions for investments in Haiti ‚Äî particularly on education and health .‚Äù Desai added that while Qatar had already ‚Äú allocated most of their $20 million ‚Ä¶ [they were] happy to consider projects we suggest .‚Äù
Al Jazeera , a Qatar-based, state-funded news organization, recently ran a list of ‚Äú revealing, juicy and quirky emails ‚Äù leaked by WikiLeaks. In its list, the news organization went over the ‚Äúpay-for-play‚Äù scheme involving the Clinton Foundation, going so far as to mention an email confirming the king of Morocco offered $12m ‚Äúfor the endowment‚Äù ‚Äî as long as Clinton was willing to take part in a meeting.
Nevertheless, the state-funded broadcaster failed to bring up the Qatar connection. Unfortunately for the organization, Wikileaks promptly noticed the omission.
In a post on Facebook , the WikiLeaks official page said, ‚Äú Al Jazeera‚Äôs list of juiciest Wikileaks forgets to mention the revelation that Qatar funds both ISIS & Bill Clinton. ‚Äù
On Twitter, the convenient lapse wasn‚Äôt forgiven. Promptly after WikiLeaks pointed out the omission, users began pressuring Al Jazeera to explain why the publication failed to link Qatar to ISIS and Clinton.",1
BREAKING: Irrefutable Proof Obama Lied to Protect Hillary Clinton‚Äôs Run for the White House Read,"By Claire Bernish at theantimedia.org
Thanks to Wikileaks, we now have the smoking gun email irrefutably proving not only did President Barack Obama know about Hillary Clinton‚Äôs non-government-issued email account, he used it in correspondence with her.
Even more damning to the president‚Äôs credibility, it appears the lie was a purposeful attempt to protect Clinton‚Äôs upcoming bid for the presidency.
Shortly after the New York Times broke the story on March 2, 2015, of Clinton‚Äôs use of a personal server to supplant the government system ‚Äî and, as has been revealed, to thwart transparency ‚Äî Obama announced publicly his lack of prior knowledge.
‚ÄúThe same time everybody else learned it through news reports,‚Äù the president told CBS News White House correspondent Bill Plante, as Zero Hedge reported . ‚ÄúThe policy of my administration is to encourage transparency, which is why my emails, the BlackBerry I carry around, all those records are available and archived.
‚ÄúI‚Äôm glad that Hillary‚Äôs instructed that those emails about official business need to be disclosed.‚Äù
It wouldn‚Äôt be a stretch to imagine, however, Obama‚Äôs placid public appearance guarded secret internal panic ‚Äî a panic echoed behind the scenes at the burgeoning Clinton campaign.
An email penned by Clinton campaign spokesman Josh Schwerin to Director of Communications, Jennifer Palmieri, and a few others, calling immediate attention to a tweet by journalist Katherine Miller paints an entirely different picture.
Miller tweeted a snippet of the aforementioned interview in which Plante asked Obama, ‚ÄúMr. President, When did you first learn that Hillary Clinton used an email system outside the U.S. Government for official business while she was Secretary of State?‚Äù
‚ÄúThe same time everybody else learned it,‚Äù he responded, ‚Äúthrough news reports.‚Äù
I have some questions here pic.twitter.com/ufkeoZCx2m",1
,"Is it better that we don‚Äôt know the true extent of Clinton‚Äôs mishandling of government documents? Is it better we don‚Äôt know the extent of her pay to play schemes? Is it better we don‚Äôt know the truth about the destruction of the legitimate government of Libya?

How about the disruption of an opposing political candidate‚Äôs political rallies and possibly the rigging of election ballot boxes?

US Government Acknowledges That al-Qaeda Is Not A Priority In Syria,"By Darius Shahtahmasebi at theantimedia.org
Last week, the U.S. State Department acknowledged that al-Qaeda-linked terror group Jabhat al-Nusra is not a ‚Äúpriority‚Äù for the United States‚Äô efforts in Syria.
One might ask, then: if al-Qaeda in Syria is not a priority for the war on terror, what is?
State Department spokesman John Kirby provided some useful insight into this dilemma, stating:
‚ÄúThe only thing that stands between where we are now and a permanent and enduring ceasefire in Syria is Bashar al-Assad and his supporters . We recognize Al-Nusra as a spoiler, we have concerns about co-mingling, I‚Äôve talked about this ad nauseam.‚Äù",1

"NATO, US, & UK To Assemble Largest Troop Buildup On Russian Border Since Cold War","By: John Vibes via thefreethoughtproject.com
In the midst of deepening tension between US allies NATO and Russia, NATO is planning the largest military buildup along the Russian border since the cold war.
NATO called on allied governments this week to contribute whatever troops and equipment they can to the effort. According to Reuters, thousands of troops are expected to arrive in the coming days and weeks.
It was reported that Italy, France, Denmark and other European states are expected to join the NATO military divisions that will be led by the United States along Russia‚Äôs border.
On Wednesday, Britain announced it is sending hundreds of soldiers and hardware to Russia‚Äôs borders as part of a huge military deployment.
A total of 800 troops, drones and tanks are moving to Estonia as part of the biggest military build-up of NATO troops on Russia‚Äôs borders since the Cold War.
In addition to the forces allocated for his specific operation, NATO has an army of over 40,000 ready to be called up to fight at any time.
The US military claims that this threatening move is meant to act as a ‚Äúdeterrent‚Äù to the Russian military, but this is obvious a move that will escalate tensions and push towards a possible third world war.",1

US Coalition Airstrikes Have Killed at Least 300 Civilians in Syria,"( ANTIWAR ) Amnesty International has issued a new statement warning that the US needs to do more to prevent civilian casualties in its coalition airstrikes in both Iraq and Syria, and cautioned the US has dramatically under-reported the number of civilians killed in their air war. The new report centered on Syria, noting that the US-led coalition had killed at least 300 civilians in Syria, and had not admitted to the vast majority of those slain. They reported the US had killed around 250 civilians just in the city of Manbij and the surrounding area.
The US backed a Kurdish invasion of Manbij earlier this past summer, and conducted several major airstrikes in the surrounding areas, including some which killed scores of civilians. As Amnesty pointed out, the US has not officially included any civilians from the Manbij strikes on their official count, despite the incidents being well established.
Amnesty warned that the lack of official recognition raised concerns that the US had not made any corrections to their policy, and that this was particularly concerning with the ongoing invasion of the city of Mosul, which is many times larger and expected to be an even longer conflict.
The Pentagon has only acknowledged a few dozen civilian deaths in both Iraq and Syria combined. The Amnesty report, while drastically higher, is still considered very conservative, with the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights putting the US-caused civilian death toll in Syria between 600 and 1,000.",1

"Political Party of Anarchists, Libertarians, Hackers, and Computer Geeks to Take Power in Iceland","By Claire Bernish at thefreethoughtproject.com
In a country continuing to shirk the ordinary, Iceland‚Äôs Pirate Party ‚Äî an amalgamation of anarchists, libertarians, and hackers, who want to ban digital surveillance ‚Äî is predicted to win the country‚Äôs national elections this Saturday.
This collection of free-thinkers have upturned the traditional Western political paradigm and hopes to use online public polls to shape governmental policy and end all Internet spying.
Although the Pirate Party formed just four years ago, its popularity has skyrocketed ‚Äî most likely for unconventional tactics aligning loosely with libertarianism ‚Äî the promotion of privacy rights and personal freedoms, and simultaneous shrinking of Big Government.
Edward Snowden has been offered the safe haven of Icelandic citizenship should the Pirates likely victory come to fruition ‚Äî which makes sense, given the party‚Äôs anti-establishment roots.
In fact, the Pirates have experienced astonishing success in a short time ‚Äî taking the nation‚Äôs longstanding political traditionalists off-guard in the process ‚Äî even the group‚Äôs founder, a programmer and former Wikileaks activist, is stunned.
Asked whether she expected the explosion of enthusiasm for the nascent Pirate Party ‚Äî which now leads in public polls with 22.6 percent ‚Äî founder Birgitta J√≥nsd√≥ttir decisively told the Washington Post , ‚ÄúNo way.‚Äù
But considering growing frustration with ever-increasing Western governments ‚Äî and all of the surveillance programs, police state tactics, and chill on personal liberties ‚Äî the rise of the Pirates, who describe themselves as neither right nor left but a radical mix of both, hardly seems too shocking.
‚ÄúPeople want real changes and they understand that we have to change the systems,‚Äù J√≥nsd√≥ttir asserted, ‚Äúwe have to modernize how we make laws.‚Äù
According to the Pirates‚Äô website , ‚ÄúThe Icelandic Pirate Party was founded on November 24th, 2012 based on the political ideology of the Swedish Pirate Party, which Richard Falkvinge founded in January 2006, to bring about internet copyright reform.‚Äù",1
Putin Warns ‚ÄúUS Has Pushed Russia Back Into Nuclear Arms Race‚Äù,"( ZHE ) Having unveiled the first images of its new nuclear missile capable of reaching US soil, Russian President Vladimir Putin is warning today that Washington‚Äôs actions are ‚Äúpushing Russian into a nuclear arms race,‚Äù forcing Russia ‚Äúto develop its nuclear attack systems.‚Äù Yesterday, Russia reveals photos of a new highly advanced liquid fuelled heavy ICBM capable of evading anti-missile defences and hitting US territory with 10 tonne nuclear payload.
The Makeyev Design Bureau ‚Äì the designer of Russia‚Äôs heavy liquid fuelled Intercontinental Ballistic Missiles (‚ÄúICBMs‚Äù) ‚Äì ie. of missiles capable of reaching US territory from Russian territory, has published the first picture of Russia‚Äôs new heavy Sarmat ICBM which is due to enter service shortly, probably in 2018.
The picture is accompanied by a short statement which reads
‚ÄúIn accordance with the Decree of the Russian Government ‚ÄòOn the State Defence Order for 2010 and the planning period 2012-2013,‚Äô the Makeyev Rocket Design Bureau was instructed to start design and development work on the Sarmat. In June 2011, the Bureau and the Russian Ministry of Defense signed a state contract for the Sarmat‚Äôs development. The prospective strategic missile system is being developed in order to assuredly and effectively fulfil objectives of nuclear deterrent by Russia‚Äôs strategic forces. ‚Äù
And now today, Putin explains:
*PUTIN: INTERMEDIATE NUCLEAR FORCES TREATY SHOULD BE OBSERVED *PUTIN: RUSSIA, U.S. MUST BREAK VICIOUS CIRCLE OF CONFRONTATION *PUTIN: RUSSIA HAS TO DEVELOP ITS NUCLEAR ATTACK SYSTEMS *PUTIN: U.S. PUSHED RUSSIA TO ARMS RACE IN NUCLEAR SPHERE",1

Twenty-two children and six teachers were killed after a school in Idlib, Syria was bombed on Wednesday, which aid groups are saying may be the deadliest attack on a school since the conflict began.
‚ÄúThis is a tragedy. It is an outrage. And if deliberate, it is a war crime,‚Äù said Anthony Lake, executive director of the United Nations children‚Äôs agency UNICEF, of the attack on the school compound.
‚ÄúThis latest atrocity may be the deadliest attack on a school since the war began more than five years ago,‚Äù he continued. ‚ÄúChildren lost forever to their families‚Ä¶teachers lost forever to their students‚Ä¶one more scar on Syria‚Äôs future.‚Äù
According to BBC :
The attack on Haas, about 75km (46 miles) south-west of Aleppo, appears to have been intense and flattened a number of buildings, reports the BBC‚Äôs James Longman in Beirut.
Children were reportedly gathered around an entrance when it was hit, at about 11:30 local time (08:30 GMT). They had been allowed to leave classes early because of the raids elsewhere in the village.
Activists shared photographs of dead bodies‚Äîmany of them children‚Äîon the floor of a makeshift treatment center.
Many are saying that Wednesday‚Äôs bombing is evidence of the increasing human suffering caused by the intractable war within Syria .",1

Think about it in this perspective: the Matrix is already 17 years old; there is an entire generation which didn‚Äôt grow up with it!
The oldest members are naturally the most die-hard ‚ÄòAnons,‚Äô and the older the member, typically, the better the hacker ‚Äì there are becoming fewer and fewer of them by the day. For the most part the oldest ‚ÄòAnons‚Äô are of the mind that Anonymous should be an exclusive hacker collective ‚Äì everyone who can‚Äôt hack is largely considered a n00b or just a fan of the movement.
Anons protesting against the government
The newest members of Anonymous tend to be social justice warriors of sorts; almost none of them are hackers, but they make up the large majority of people who now call themselves ‚ÄúAnonymous.‚Äù They are, for the large part, protestors, civil rights/liberties advocates or people who want to change the world, but are unsure on how to go about it. They seem to be drawn to Anonymous, not because all of the hacks occurring around the world, but because they see Anonymous publicly advocating for many of the same things they believe in.
There are a lot of things happening in this world that people do not get to vote on, or simply have no say over; there are a lot of things that tend to control/dictate peoples‚Äô lives, for which they have no control over.
I remember a conversation last year with a friend in the movement. I was frustrated because all I want is to change and make an impact on the world, but always feel like nothing more than an ant ‚Äì nothing I seem to do is even measurable in the grand scheme of life.
They responded, ‚ÄúWelcome to the anthill.‚Äù
Just as with any group of people in the world, or in politics, there are bound to be some fringe lunatics/extremists on both sides of the spectrum ‚Äì and Anonymous is no different.
People do not seem to understand that no one in Anonymous speaks for anyone else in Anonymous. Far too often, people in Anonymous are left defending ‚Äì or accused ‚Äì for the actions of other people they know nothing about. People also do not seem to understand what it means when some says ‚ÄúAnonymous is an idea, not a group.‚Äù
What it means to be part of an ‚Äúidea‚Äù can also differ depending on the purpose. But what I have come to believe this ‚Äúidea‚Äù means is a freedom of expression in its purest form: Freedom from censorship; freedom for ALL knowledge to be free and available to the public/society; freedom for people to stand up and fight for whatever they believe in; freedom for everyone‚Äôs voice to matter ‚Äì not just corporations/politicians/government elites.",1

The 1851 Treaty Camp was set up this past Sunday directly in the path of the pipeline, on land recently purchased by DAPL. Today this camp, a reclamation of unceded Dakota territory affirmed as part of the Standing Rock Reservation in the Ft. Laramie Treaty of 1851, was violently cleared. Both blockades established this past weekend to enable that occupation were also cleared. In addition to pepper spray and percussion grenades, shotguns were fired into the crowd with less lethal ammunition and a sound cannon was used (see images below). At least one person was tased and the barbed hook lodged in his face, just outside his eye. Another was hit in the face by a rubber bullet.
A prayer circle of elders, including several women, was interrupted and all were arrested for standing peacefully on the public road. A tipi was erected in the road and was recklessly dismantled, despite promises from law enforcement that they would merely mark the tipi with a yellow ribbon and ask its owners to retrieve it. A group of water protectors was also dragged out of a ceremony in a sweat lodge erected in the path of the pipeline, wearing minimal clothing, thrown to the ground, and arrested.
A member of the International Indigenous Youth Council (IIYC) that had her wrist broken during a mass-arrest on October 22nd was hurt again after an officer gripped her visibly injured wrist and twisted it during an attempted arrest. At least six other members of the youth council verified that they had been maced up to five times and were also shot and hit with bean bags. In addition to being assaulted, an altar item and sacred staff was wrenched from the hands of an IIYC member by police.

WikiLeaks List Exposes At Least 65 Corporate ‚ÄòPresstitutes‚Äô Who Colluded to Hide Clinton‚Äôs Crimes,"By Claire Bernish at thefreethoughtproject.com
Revelations from the Wikileaks release of John Podesta‚Äôs emails yet again prove mainstream, corporate media serves as Hillary Clinton‚Äôs personal cheerleading squad ‚Äî and is devoid of any iteration of journalistic integrity.
Thanks to Wikileaks and the Intercept , in fact, we now have a list of no less than 65 mainstream ‚Äúreporters‚Äù whose campaign coverage constitutes propaganda for the Clinton campaign ‚Äî and no wonder, considering the obscenely lopsided drivel presented by their outlets.
As (actual) journalists Glenn Greenwald and Lee Fang reported on October 9, the Intercept exclusively received documents obtained by the source known as Guccifer 2.0 evidencing Clinton campaign tactics to court journalists portraying the former secretary of state in a positive light.
‚ÄúAs these internal documents demonstrate,‚Äù the Intercept reported , ‚Äúa central component of the Clinton campaign strategy is ensuring that journalists they believe are favorable to Clinton are tasked to report the stories the campaign wants circulated.
‚ÄúAt times, Clinton‚Äôs campaign staff not only internally drafted the stories they wanted published but even specified what should be Quote: d ‚Äòon background‚Äô and what should be described as ‚Äòon the record.‚Äô‚Äù
One internal strategy document dated January 2015 ‚Äî months before Clinton officially kicked off her campaign in April ‚Äî with the curious heading ‚ÄúEarned Media/Next Steps‚Äù exposes how the campaign made an albeit infrequent practice of crafting supposed news pieces from beginning to completion.

‚ÄòPlan-B‚Äô ‚Äî Obama Paves Way to Give Syrian ‚ÄòModerate Rebels‚Äô Anti-Aircraft Weapons to Fight Russia,"By Claire Bernish at thefreethoughtproject.com
President Obama contemplated arming the already controversial ‚Äòmoderate‚Äô Syrian rebels weapons to ‚Äúdefend themselves against Russian aircraft and artillery‚Äù as his Plan B for Syria when all else failed in the effort to oust Assad ‚Äî but although this treacherous plan has been effectively shelved, it remains an option for whomever next ascends to the White House.
According to a new report from the Washington Post , Obama‚Äôs Plan B has neither been ‚Äúapproved or rejected‚Äù in the U.S.‚Äô disintegrating and increasingly complex campaign to depose Syrian President Bashar al Assad ‚Äî which has, of course, precipitated a perilous proxy war with staunch Syrian ally, Russia.
Skepticism over allowing the CIA to provide various anti-Assad terrorists ‚Äî euphemistically termed moderate rebels by the U.S. ‚Äî with ‚Äútruck-mounted antiaircraft weapons that could help rebel units but would be difficult for a terrorist group to conceal and use against civilian aircraft‚Äù apparently forced the plan to be tabled, the Post reports.
In the U.S. program to topple Assad, the CIA has armed and trained defectors from Syrian military known as the Free Syrian Army ‚Äî whose own defectors went on to form the Islamic State ‚Äî as well as other terroristic groups virtually indistinguishable from one another except for their political ideologies.
These issues factored into restrictions on weapons the U.S. would provide to their sponsored rebels; but, as the Post explains:
‚ÄúRebels chafed at the restriction, complaining that it left them vulnerable to air attack by Assad and, more recently, Russia.‚Äù
Plan B was envisaged as a compromise by the CIA.
But the complex state of affairs in Syria has led not only the FSA, but other ‚Äòmoderates,‚Äô to ‚Äòradicalize‚Äô ‚Äî complicating U.S.‚Äô goals and frustrating Russian efforts to purge the embattled nation of terrorists. While the Pentagon‚Äôs public goal has duly sought to wrest control from Assad and fight the Islamic State, the CIA program of arming rebels is widely considered counterproductive ‚Äî if not, perhaps, nefarious.
Plan B, despite potentially devastating repercussions, retains stolid support from top officials, including unsurprisingly CIA Director John Brennan and Secretary of Defense Ashton Carter ‚Äî but has lost favor recently with former proponents, including Secretary of State John Kerry.
Kerry and other skeptics rightly grasp providing heavy artillery to rebels fighting Russia-backed Syrian government forces to down Russian aircraft ‚Äî which would undoubtedly turn the smoldering U.S. proxy battle into an all-out war with Russia.
Additionally, the Post reports, a growing number of U.S. officials feel the contentious CIA program has only proven to bedevil the ultimate goal of regime change, and, as one unnamed ‚Äòsenior official‚Äô noted, CIA units are ‚Äúnot doing any better on the battlefield, they‚Äôre up against a more formidable adversary, and they‚Äôre increasingly dominated by extremists,‚Äù adding, ‚ÄúWhat has this program become, and how will history record this effort?‚Äù",1

NFL Warns Clenbuterol Level So High in Beef that Players Fail Drug Tests,"The National Football League (NFL) in the United States has issued a warning to players , asking them to avoid eating beef because of the high levels of Clenbuterol . These high levels have been said to cause players to fail drug tests. Clenbuterol is a muscle-building and weight-loss stimulant. It is a substance banned by the league, and considered a performance enhancing drug. However, recently, many players in the NFL have failed drug tests linked to Clenbuterol. If a player fails this drug test then he is banned for 10 matches.
The majority of beef consumed in the United States is imported from China and Mexico. The NFL said beef from China and Mexico is particularly dangerous to the players.
Clenbuterol has the ability to build muscle, which is why farmers use it, increasing the size of their cattle to increase profits. In Mexico, cattle ranchers are banned from using Clenbuterol as a growth enhancer. However, it is said farmers are not complying with the regulation, leading to widespread abuse of the substance within the nation‚Äôs cattle industry.
The Free Thought Project reports that the NFL‚Äôs independent drug-testing administrator has officially sent a memo to all players in the league, telling them that consuming large quantities of beef while visiting China and Mexico may result in a positive Clenbuterol test. The memo further stated that if players refused to heed the warning and do otherwise, they do so at their own risk.
‚ÄúPlayers are warned to be aware of this issue when traveling to Mexico and China. Please take caution if you decide to consume meat, and understand that you do so at your own risk. Players are responsible for what is in their bodies,‚Äù the memo said.
In 2015, the Texan‚Äôs left tackle, Duane Brown, tested positive for Clenbuterol after a trip to Mexico, during which he ate Mexican beef, sources told ESPN . After a months-long process, Brown was finally cleared in April this year, permitting him to avoid what would have been a 10-match ban.
When the memo was issued, several players in the NFL, including the Arizona Cardinals defensive back, Patrick Peterson, took to Twitter to express his disappointment in the issue.

5 Things You Need to Know About the Dakota Access Pipeline Protests,"By Nick Bernabe at theantimedia.org
A small Standing Rock Sioux site in North Dakota called the Sacred Stone Camp has been propelled into the national news narrative following their stand against the Dakota Access Pipeline. Due in part to independent media coverage of the ongoing standoff, the Sacred Stone camp has grown into a formidable opposition against the $3.8 billion, 1,200-mile long pipeline.
Due to misinformation coming from law-enforcement, political favoritism toward the pipeline builders, and the media‚Äôs blatant reluctance to report on the pipeline, it‚Äôs hard to tell truth from fiction. Anti-Media , along with our partners in the independent media and our embedded journalist at the opposition encampment, have been covering the unfolding standoff continuously. Here are five things you need to know.
1. Who is opposing the pipeline ‚Äî and why The Standing Rock Sioux tribe is leading the opposition to the Dakota Access Pipeline. They have been joined by the largest tribal coalition in over 100 years in their stand against the pipeline. The coalition is also comprised of activists, allies, and environmentalists, collectively known as ‚Äúwater protectors,‚Äù at the Sacred Stone Camp, an encampment close to the location where the pipeline is planned to cross the Missouri River in North Dakota. According to the Sacred Stone camp website , they are opposing the pipeline because ‚Äú[t]he Dakota Access threatens everything from farming and drinking water to entire ecosystems, wildlife and food sources surrounding the Missouri .‚Äù
The Standing Rock Sioux also say the pipeline is violating treaty land , Sioux territory that was established many years ago by the federal government. ‚ÄúWe will not allow Dakota Access to trespass on our treaty territory and destroy our medicines and our culture.‚Äù
The opposition to the pipeline spreads across several states and is not opposed solely by Native Americans. Farmers, ranchers, and landowners are also opposed to the pipeline. Many of them have had their land taken from them against their will and given to the pipeline via eminent domain.
2. The U.S. government and the pipeline corporation are continuing a long tradition of disrespecting Native Americans
The United States has a very bad reputation for treating Native Americans, the original inhabitants of this land, as less than human. In many instances in the past, the land where Native Americans lived was deemed to be of higher value than the Natives‚Äô lives.
Such has been the case in North Dakota ‚Äî not only now, but in the past as well. According to The Atlantic :
‚ÄúThe land beneath the pipeline was accorded to Sioux peoples by the Treaty of Fort Laramie in 1868. Eleven years later, the U.S. government incited and won the Great Sioux War, and ‚Äòrenegotiated‚Äô a new treaty with the Sioux under threat of starvation. In that document, the tribe ceded much of the Laramie land, including the Black Hills of South Dakota, where many whites believed there to be gold.‚Äù",1
War on Weed: Bayer-Monsanto Working on Genetically Modified Corporate Cannabis?,"Big Cannabis ‚Äì on the lines of Big Pharma ‚Äì is on the cards. At least that‚Äôs what Germany-based pharmaceutical giant Bayer‚Äôs $66 billion takeover of America-based agrichemical giant Monsanto (a leading producer of RoundUp Ready genetically modified crops) indicates. Financed from a consortium of corrupt, in-debt, and influential banks (including Goldman Sachs, HSBC, JP Morgan, and Bank of America), the multi-billion-dollar deal (negotiated by the Rothschild Banking Cartel) brings Bayer ( famous for selling heroin to children and financing Nazi concentration camps ) closer to the multi-billion-dollar cannabis market through its ‚Äùmission‚Äù to create a one-stop shop for seeds, crop chemicals and computer-aided services to cannabis growers .
#Cannabis is Non Toxic but #Monsanto will make it toxic by making a GMO version. #SaveCannabis #VoteNoOn64
‚Äî David (@rskls) September 6, 2016
Cannabis proponents believe the largest all-cash deal on record will destroy the infant marijuana industry by introducing genetically modified cannabis seeds, highly expensive cannabis-based drugs, monopolistic use of patents, and restrictive business practices. Leafly notes:
‚ÄúThe worry is that the combined firm will have the financial and political influence to do to cannabis what it has already done to corn, tobacco, and other cash crops ‚Äî namely, use pricey patented cannabis seeds (Roundup Ready Blue Dream, anyone?) that favor large-scale operators and rigidly control how all cannabis farmers farm. The merger, in other words, could be the first step toward Big Cannabis .‚Äù
Monsanto‚Äôs decades old intimate ties with the Scotts Miracle-Gro Company ‚Äî a leading producer of pesticides for commercial and consumer lawn and garden use (who was ordered to pay $12.5 million in criminal fines and civil penalties for violations of Federal Pesticide Laws in 2012) ‚Äî is especially a matter of concern. Monsanto and Scotts Miracle-Gro have long been partners with the DEA to produce hormones and carcinogenic chemicals used in the wars against marijuana and coca plants.
Jim Hagedorn, who took over Scotts Miracle-Gro in 2001, shared his intention to ‚Äúinvest, like, half a billion in the pot business‚Äù with Forbes in July, calling cannabis the biggest thing he has ever seen in lawn and garden. Forbes reports:
Scotts Miracle-Gro shelled out $135 million last year on two California-based businesses [including the $130 million buyout of General Hydroponics] that sell fertilizers, soils and accessories to pot growers. It recently spent another $120 million on a still-undisclosed lighting and hydroponics equipment company in Amsterdam and promises to invest about another $150 million by the end of 2016.
Altogether, the deals are bigger than the largest single acquisition in the history of Scotts Miracle-Gro, which takes in $160 million of profit on $3 billion in sales annually.",1
What Would Happen if the U.S. was Nuked?,"Ever wonder what would happen if the U.S. was nuked? While there are numerous factors to take into consideration in the event of a nuclear war on U.S. soil, we‚Äôve done our best to answer some of the most commonly asked questions, in the simplest and most understandable of terms.
Which Areas Would be Hit, and How Far Would the Fallout Reach? On the topic of which regions of the U.S. would be hit; part of it is left up to guess work, as we are unable to fully predict the aggressing nation‚Äôs tactics, but then much of it is also based on logic. For example, any nation that strikes the U.S. will want to disable their nukes, so we can easily surmise that areas such as North Dakota would be obliterated.
Active nuclear energy plants would also make good targets, as the added nuclear energy from the reactors would maximize destruction. And then of course, there are the major government facilities that would be targeted, at least, those that are known of ‚Äì unfortunately, it‚Äôs safe to assume an aggressing nation‚Äôs intelligence would have a better idea of the U.S. government‚Äôs ‚Äúsoft spots‚Äù than the average American citizen.
Before we get too far ahead of ourselves, however, let‚Äôs go with what we know; what kind of targets would the U.S. go for? In the case of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, numerous military personnel, politicians, and now historians claim that the first bomb was dropped to prove it could be done, and the second bomb was dropped to display the United States‚Äô strength to Joseph Stalin in the Soviet Union, who was originally aligned with the U.S. and Britain during WWII, but who the U.S. knew would become a problem once the war was over, (Foner, 2014, p. 887-949).
While we are aware there are numerous citizens who, to this day, refuse to believe any other version of events than the original government narrative, the point is, we can‚Äôt use the cases of Hiroshima and Nagasaki as an accurate indicator of the type of targets the U.S. would choose. Fortunately though, we do have a detailed list of targets the U.S. created in 1956 ‚Äì in the event of war with the Soviet Union ‚Äì that was released through the National Archives and Records Administration . The list includes major cities for ‚Äú systematic destruction ,‚Äù including areas that contain ‚Äú Agricultural Equipment ‚Äù and ‚Äú Transformers, Heavy .‚Äù Most horridly though, was a target simply titled ‚Äú Population .‚Äù
Yep. The almighty, all wise, glorious, wholesome and righteous, baseball-loving, apple pie-eating, land of the free, and home of the brave, planned to target large populations of innocent civilians, and it‚Äôs with that in mind we can surmise that largely populated areas would be potential targets here in the States, as well.
Provided below are two maps created by FEMA, the first of which is from 1990, and shows the presumed targets the Soviets would have hit in the event of a nuclear attack. ‚ÄúFallout,‚Äù according to the University of Notre Dame , is described as the mixture of earth and/or water that has entered the rising fireball caused from the detonation of a nuclear bomb near the Earth‚Äôs surface. This mixes with the radioactive debris of the explosion at an early stage, and is then blown into the troposphere and lower stratosphere, creating fallout. The most lethal fallout is indicated by the darkest coloration, while the lesser lethal fallout is indicated with yellow:
Source: FEMA
In this map, FEMA shows a sample fallout pattern we could expect in a nuclear attack:
Source: FEMA
How Long Would the Fallout Last? After being blown into the troposphere and lower stratosphere, ‚Äú the material is then re-distributed over polar (3-12 months) or equatorial regions (8-24 months). Fall-out removal times (defined in terms of half-life) ranges from 10 to 24 months depending upon seasonal conditions, most rapid during spring, slow in summer ,‚Äù again, this is according to the University of Notre Dame, (source above).
Where Would Government Officials and the ‚ÄúElite‚Äù Go in the Event of a Nuclear Attack?",1
The Truth that America Doesn't Want You to Know about War Crimes in Syria,"After claiming the lives of more than a quarter of a million people; causing the biggest refugee crisis since World War II; and fueling the rise of Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS), the civil war in Syria, which started in 2011 as a peaceful protest against President Bashar al-Assad but later turned into an international proxy war, is today, signaling World War III. At least, that‚Äôs what the West and the mainstream media want you to believe . However, the truth is the United States and its allies are using the ‚Äúwar crimes‚Äù and ‚Äúcrimes of historic proportions‚Äù in Syria to prolong the proxy war, overthrow Assad, and annex an independent country. Sadly, the United Nations, Amnesty International, the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, and other ‚Äúconcerned parties‚Äù (including the mainstream media), support the West in its malicious intent.
The Western Claim ‚ÄúRussia and the Syrian regime owe the world more than an explanation about why they keep hitting hospitals and medical facilities and children and women,‚Äù US Secretary of State John Kerry recently commented. Kerry begged for an investigation of the Russian and Syrian military strikes against civilians and medical facilities in Aleppo, as war crimes.
‚ÄúThere is clear and abundant evidence the Assad regime and the Russian government are committing crimes that include, but are not limited to, deliberate attacks on civilians, collective punishment, starvation as a tool of war, torture, murder, inhumane treatment of prisoners and the use of chemical weapons on the battlefield,‚Äù asserted The Washington Post .
‚ÄúThe ancient city of Aleppo, a place of millennial civility and beauty, is today a slaughterhouse ‚Äî a gruesome locus of pain and fear, where the lifeless bodies of small children are trapped under streets of rubble and pregnant women deliberately bombed,‚Äù observed the UN human rights‚Äô chief, seeking a war crimes inquiry.
The Western Evidence 1. A commission for International Justice and Accountability ‚Äî a non-profit organization funded by western states including the UK, US, the EU, Germany, Switzerland, Norway, Canada and Denmark ‚Äî smuggled over 600,000 top-secret Syrian government documents brought to Western Europe .
An analysis of some 400 documents ‚Äúlinked the systematic torture and murder of tens of thousands of Syrians to a written policy approved by President Bashar al-Assad, coordinated among his security-intelligence agencies, and implemented by regime operatives.‚Äù Current status: Neither the documents nor the evidence has been made public.
2. A decorated American journalist and a former CIA officer, Adam Ciralsky wrote about the 53,275 photos that ‚ÄúCaesar‚Äù (a Syrian military photographer turned war crimes whistleblower, who fled the country in August 2013) took as grisly evidence of Assad‚Äôs brutality.
‚ÄúThe pictures, most of them taken in Syrian military hospitals, show corpses photographed at close range ‚Äî one at a time as well as in small groupings. Virtually all of the bodies ‚Äî thousands of them ‚Äî betray signs of torture: gouged eyes; mangled genitals ; bruises and dried blood from beatings; acid and electric burns; emaciation; and marks from strangulation,‚Äù Ciralsky explained. Current Status: The treasure trove, as well as the photographer ‚ÄúCaesar,‚Äù is hidden from the public eye.
3. In 2015, Amnesty International documented the systematic and widespread ‚Äúunthinkable atrocities‚Äù war crimes, and crimes against humanity committed by Assad‚Äôs regime, in a 74-page report (including indiscriminate use of explosive weapons, arbitrary arrests, torture, and enforced disappearances). The ‚Äòheartbreaking‚Äô research involved merely 78 residents (mostly former) and 29 professionals working in Aleppo .
4. The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights ‚Äî the London-based monitoring group, often Quote: d as the most authoritative source of information about human rights abuse in Syria ‚Äî is a tool of Western propaganda run by one man who last visited Syria in 2000 (11 years before the armed conflict began). He relies on ‚Äúintelligence‚Äù allegedly gathered by around 200 ‚Äúactivists‚Äù who he has never met. Current Status: Whatever the SOHR claims, the mainstream media reports as truth without verifying its nature ‚Äì because the SOHR does not reference any sources.
The Western Lies Why is the angry and (nowadays) concerned world not asking the United States and the mainstream media a few pertinent questions? What is the West doing in Syria? Why is the peace-loving West prolonging the war? Why is the West backing the rebels in a foreign country? Why is the West funding and arming ISIS?
Why are the Western forces not being held accountable for war crimes like bombing a hospital? Why is the mainstream media, the NGOs and the UN not holding the West accountable for crimes committed on their own land, or in Israel, Africa or Yemen?
One reason may be because of the abundance of natural gas under Syrian soil, and that this may very well be another ‚Äòpetrodollar‚Äô war . The US had long had its gaze set on Syria ‚Äì years before the civil war and the 2011 ‚Äúrevolution.‚Äù Leaked WikiLeaks cables show the US ambassador to Syria (2004-2007) William Roebuck discussing a plan to remove Assad from power, in December 2006 .
While the Russian and Iranian forces entered Syria on Assad‚Äôs request to fight against ISIS and armed rebels, the Western military invaded Syria ‚Äî a sovereign country and United Nations member state ‚Äî to violently overthrow the Syrian government.
Why didn‚Äôt the West invade Saudi Arabia to initiate ‚Äúhumanitarian intervention‚Äù and save innocent citizens from its brutal dictator? Saudi Arabia remains a member of the United Nations Human Rights Council and a U.S. ally, despite its poor human rights record ‚Äî if attacking an independent harmless country is justified, why did the US act against Osama bin Laden?
The Western effort to annex Syria has relied on a series of crudely-spun lies and media-generated talking points. In September, RT dared to expose the top 10 Western lies about Syrian conflict that the mainstream media are trading in, to fool the Western public into backing yet another failed ‚Äònation-building‚Äô project (after Yugoslavia, Iraq and Libya). Obviously, the fear mongering media didn‚Äôt find it profitable to give the lies much, if any, coverage in the West.
From calling the conflict a fault of wicked Assad, and Assad a brutal dictator who enjoyed no popular support, to portraying him as an uncompromising President interested only in ‚Äòkilling his own people‚Äô ‚Äì and not in peace and reconciliation, the list is endless. From accusing the Syrian government and Russia for helping ISIS and terming the Western interventions in Syria as humanitarian, to claiming Russia was acting out of self-interest and that the West was on the side of the ‚Äògood guys‚Äô in Syria, can you be certain of the ‚Äòtruth‚Äô? Realistically, the West hasn‚Äôt been fighting ‚Äòterror‚Äô in Syria, it has aided it.
Remember the American journalist Serena Shim, who was killed in October 2014, after she revealed the ISIS-Turkey-US link that proved the West was assisting ISIS in Syria?
The Syrian Reality Henry Lowendorf, a member of the Executive Board of the U.S. Peace Council‚Äôs Peace and Fact-Finding Delegation to Syria ‚Äì who returned from Syria in August ‚Äì noted: ‚ÄúWhat we saw in Syria goes against everything we read in the United States.‚Äù
Before 2011, illiteracy in Syria had been wiped out; the life expectancy was 75.9 years and the government spent massive amounts of money on improving the nation. Developing irrigation, electricity, water and road building projects, and expanding the health services and education to rural areas, all occurred; and China invested hundreds of millions of dollars to modernize Syria‚Äôs aging oil and gas infrastructure.",1
US Votes 'No' As UN Adopts Landmark Resolution Calling to Ban Nuclear Weapons,"Co-sponsored by 57 nations, L41 calls for a 2017 conference ‚Äòto negotiate a legally binding instrument to prohibit nuclear weapons, leading towards their total elimination‚Äô The United Nations on Thursday adopted a landmark resolution calling for the ultimate elimination of nuclear weapons worldwide.
Resolution L.41 (pdf) was accepted by a vote of 123-38, with 16 member nations abstaining. The vote was held during a meeting of the First Committee of the UN General Assembly, which deals with disarmament and international security matters.
‚ÄúFor seven decades, the UN has warned of the dangers of nuclear weapons, and people globally have campaigned for their abolition. Today the majority of states finally resolved to outlaw these weapons,‚Äù said Beatrice Fihn, executive director of International Campaign to Abolish Nuclear weapons (ICAN).
Setsuko Thurlow , a survivor of the Hiroshima and leading proponent of a ban, also celebrated Thursday‚Äôs vote.
‚ÄúThis is a truly historic moment for the entire world,‚Äù Thurlow said. ‚ÄúFor those of us who survived the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, it is a very joyous occasion. We have been waiting so long for this day to come.‚Äù
As expected, nuclear powers including the United States, France, Canada, Israel, Russia, and the United Kingdom, as well as several of their European allies, were among the nations who voted against the ban.

"Putin: ""Russia Is Not Going to Attack Anyone""","( ANTIWAR ) Complaining about Western ‚Äúhysteria‚Äù surrounding repeated predictions of Russian military attacks on NATO member nations, Russian President Vladimir Putin sought to resolve two solid years of predictions to that effect with a straightforward assurance that ‚Äú Russia is not going to attack anyone .‚Äù Putin accused Western nations of having ‚Äúmythical, dreamt-up problems,‚Äù and insisted the idea that Russia was going to attack the West was ‚Äú simply stupid and unrealistic .‚Äù He added that he believes the idea is being played up to justify bigger military spending.
The Russian president also sought to dismiss allegations that he is plotting to rig the US elections to his own benefit, noting that the US is a great power and not some banana republic with an easily manipulated political system. Russia has repeatedly denied involvement in such plots.
NATO has played up the Russian threat to justify sending over 40,000 ground troops to the Russian border, with ever-growing numbers announced all the time. Such predictions started after the ouster of a pro-Russian government in Ukraine led to a civil war in that country‚Äôs east, with NATO military leaders repeatedly predicting Russian tanks rolling across Ukraine into NATO countries.",1
"Ashton Kutcher Rescues 6,000 Sex Trafficking Victims, Arrests over 2,000 Traffickers [Video]","Christopher Ashton Kutcher is a well-known figure in the American entertainment industry. Apart from acting, Kutcher is also an investor. A venture capitalist, Kutcher has successfully invested in several high technology startups with some of his investments including Skype, Foursquare, Airbnb, Path and Fab.com. But despite being a businessman and a public figure, societal problems are dear to his heart. In 2008, Kutcher and his ex-wife, Demi Moore decided to tackle one of the more serious crimes facing our modern world ‚Äì human/sex trafficking.
By basic definition, human trafficking is the trade of humans, most commonly for the purpose of sexual slavery, forced labor or commercial sexual exploitation. The trade is a modern form of slavery . It involves controlling a person through force, fraud, or coercion to exploit the victim. Over the years, the United Nations, International Non-Governmental Organizations, human rights activists, and individuals have all stepped up efforts in order to end the trade. However, due to the high rate of unemployment and rising poverty levels in some nations, the trade is still secretly thriving.
Also, with the rise of the Internet and technology, it is becoming increasingly easy for traffickers to lure people, especially young girls, into the dirty business. Mostly, traffickers will hide on the deep web, using sophisticated gadgets to carry out their trade.
Kutcher and Moore decided to concentrate their efforts on the Internet, to thwart the trade of the traffickers. They set up an organization called Thorn. Thorn‚Äôs mission is very simple: to eliminate sex-trafficking and child exploitation over the Internet.
With the help of around 20 technology companies, they set up the Thorn Task Technical Force. Technology companies such as Facebook, Google, Twitter, Yahoo!, Snapchat and Imgur are all part of this task force.
They dedicate their time and resources to searching the darker corners of the Internet, hunting out traffickers who have been involving in trafficking innocent people. Since establishing Thorn in 2008, the organization has so far, identified and rescued over 6,000 trafficking victims and captured over 2,000 traffickers ‚Äì many of which are now in the process of facing criminal charges.",1
"Evidence: Eating Raw Cannabis PREVENTS Cancer, Does NOT Get You High","There is evidence out there, supporting that cannabis oil destroys cancer , cures severe epilepsy , treats muscle spasms caused by multiple sclerosis, and saves lives . The National Cancer Institute has admitted cannabis oil kills cancer cells . It is widely acknowledged that natural compounds of the cannabis ‚Äî a plant that the use, sale, and possession of is still illegal in the United States ‚Äî can prevent, treat and manage inflammation; neurodegenerative diseases such as multiple sclerosis; brain disorders such as epilepsy; lifestyle related diseases such as diabetes and cancer; chronic liver diseases such as liver cirrhosis; and medical conditions such as fibromyalgia.
Meanwhile, experts have come forward to make a strong case for eating unheated raw cannabis for maximum health benefits. While smoked or vaporized cannabis can be used as a medicinal therapy, they claim, eating raw cannabis can help prevent health issues from arising altogether ‚Äî without psychoactive effect.
Dr. William Courtney, a California-based physician and a dietary raw cannabis specialist , says we are actually walking away from 99% of the benefits cannabis provides when we cook or smoke cannabis. He explains:
‚ÄúIn its raw form, the cannabis plant contains both THCA (Tetra Hydro Cannabinolic-Acid) and CBDA (Cannabidiolic-Acid), two cannabinoids known for their medicinal benefits; each of which must be heated in order to produce THC and CBD, respectively. Only when you decarboxylate THCA, turning it into THC, does it cause psychoactive effects or ‚Äúthe high‚Äù most associated with smoking cannabis.
‚ÄúAdditionally, the body is able to tolerate larger dosages of cannabinoids when cannabis is consumed in the raw form. This is because when you smoke cannabis, the THC actually acts as a CB1 receptor agonist and your body can only absorb 10 mg at a time.
‚ÄúIf you don‚Äôt heat cannabis, you can go up to five or six hundred milligrams and use the plant strictly as a dietary supplement by upping the anti-oxidant and neuro-protective levels which come into play at hundreds of milligrams of CBDA and THCA. It is this dramatic increase in dose from 10 mg of psychoactive THC to the 500 mg ‚Äì 1,000 mg of non-psychoactive THCA, CBDA, and CBGA that comprises the primary difference between traditional medical cannabis treatments and using cannabis as a dietary supplement.‚Äù
It is no secret that cannabis contains a wealth of nutrients , proteins, vitamins, terpenes, Omega 3 and 6 fatty acids, essential amino acids, and antioxidants. When eaten raw, our body is able to process much larger amounts of THCA and CBDA ‚Äî which possess anti-inflammatory properties, anti-diabetic properties, and anti-ischemic properties ‚Äî and converts these cannabinoid acids ‚Äî linked to the prevention of chronic diseases such as migraine, irritable bowel syndrome, glaucoma, and fibromyalgia ‚Äî into essential nutrients through its metabolism.",1

Thousands Of Buffalo Appear At Site Of Standing Rock Protest [Watch],"By Amanda Froelich at trueactivist.com
During a standoff between riot police and peaceful protesters, a herd of buffalo appeared near the Standing Rock protest camp.
Yesterday, tensions between law enforcement workers and peaceful protestors with the Standing Rock Sioux tribe escalated. A series of standoffs resulted in ‚Äúprotectors‚Äù being maced, shot with rubber bullets, tasered, and even attacked with sound and concussion cannons. Ultimately, 117 people were arrested in the plight to stop the four-state Dakota Access Pipeline (DAPL) from being constructed.
After months of similar struggle to protect sacred burial grounds and the Missouri river, opposers of the DAPL were blessed today when a herd of buffalo appeared from nowhere. While mass arrests, macing, and beatings from batons took place, a stampede of bison appeared near the Standing Rock protest camp. Reportedly, a cry of joy erupted from the crowd, as protectors have been praying for help from the American bison (known as Tatanka Oyate) during their standoff with riot police and national guardsmen.
As UsUncut relays , the Native American culture honors the Tatanka Oyate as a symbol of sacrifice. Its appearance is reportedly being hailed as a gift from the Great Spirit.
Despite impressive attention being given to the protesting of the Dakota Access Pipeline by alternative media sites , activists on the frontlines, and even celebrities such as Mark Ruffalo and Shailene Woodley , little is being done in Washington D.C. The tribal leaders are calling on state and federal governments to respect the constitutional rights of water protectors and to stop the mistreatment of the indigenous who assert their ownership of the land due to a 1881 treaty.",1

"Researchers Detect Strange Messages from the Stars, Says it Might be Aliens","Researchers involved in the Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence (SETI) have announced in a paper that they have detected new messages from the stars, saying they are likely to have been generated by aliens. The researchers are from the University of Laval in Quebec, Canada. Their paper has been accepted by the journal Publications of the Astronomical Society of the Pacific and is titled ‚Äò Discovery of peculiar periodic spectral modulations in a small fraction of solar type stars.‚Äô
According to a print version of the paper ‚Äì also available online ‚Äì the title of the paper was initially proposed as ‚ÄòSignals probably from Extraterrestrial Intelligence.‚Äô However, this was later changed due to concerns raised by some observers.
The researchers who made the discovery revealed they heard unusual messages from deep in space. For them, they strongly believe the messages are coming from aliens.
The paper revealed the finding of specific modulations in just 234 out of the 2.5 million stars that have been observed during a survey of the sky. The work found that a tiny fraction of them seemed to be behaving strangely. According to the researchers, their analysis of these modulations in a tiny set of stars, may indicate that these messages are from extraterrestrial intelligence looking to alert humanity of their existence.
The researchers said there is no obvious explanation to what they discovered, hence their conclusion that the messages are coming from aliens.
‚ÄúWe find that the detected signals have exactly the shape of an [extraterrestrial intelligence] signal predicted in the previous publication and are therefore in agreement with this hypothesis. The fact that they are only found in a very small fraction of stars within a narrow spectral range centered near the spectral type of the sun is also in agreement with the Extraterrestrial Intelligence hypothesis,‚Äù the researchers, EF Borra and E Trottier wrote in their paper.
The researchers also noted that further work will need to be done, in order to confirm or deny the hypothesis they have put forward. Doing so will require watching for the same signals on different equipment, aiding to discard all other explanations. This will be done by a so-called independent body.",1
"ISIS Kidnaps, Kills at Least 30 Civilians in Afghanistan","Locals Say as Many as 42 May Have Been Killed in 'Revenge' Attack   26, 2016 Share This 
Underscoring the group‚Äôs growing presence around Afghanistan, ISIS has launched a mass kidnapping and execution in Afghanistan‚Äôs Ghor Province today, rounding up and shooting dozens of civilians who were gathering firewood in the hills. 
The victims were nomads from the Kuchi group, and while it was initially thought the attack might‚Äôve been part of an ethnic conflict in the area over sheep ownership, it has since been attributed to ISIS, who officials say has a growing presence in the area and a bone to pick with the Kuchi. 
That the victims were nomads is making it hard to nail down exactly how many people were killed, with official reports saying it was at least 30, and locals saying as many as 42 were missing and presumed to have been killed in the attack. 
Ghor is far afield from the areas ISIS has been previously reported to have a major presence in Afghanistan. Early on they were claimed to be confined to the Nangarhar Province, but have also set up some territorial possessions in the far south.  ",1
Syrian Airstrike Kills 35 Civilians in Idlib,"Attack Hit a School, Killing Several Children   26, 2016 Share This 
According to the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, a flurry of airstrikes today against the Idlib Province in northern Syria killed at least 35 civilians today, including an estimated 22 school children, when one of the strikes hit a school. 
The Observatory said they weren‚Äôt clear if the attacks were carried out by Syrian or Russian warplanes, though later reports from other sources attributed the attacks to the Syrians. The Idlib Province is controlled by the al-Qaeda-linked Nusra Front. 
This has made it a regular target for airstrikes, though the comparative lack of intelligence on the location of Nusra fighters means that the attacks have a tendency to hit civilian bystanders. Few Nusra fighters have been caught up in any of the recent strikes. 
The main fighting between Nusra and the Syrian military recently is over Aleppo, though there is also considerable tension along the border between Idlib and Latakia Provinces, with the Syrian military having talked up a potential invasion of Idlib from the coast for awhile.  ",1
NATO Confirms Major Buildup in Eastern Europe,"Russia Seeks to Expand Baltic Fleet as Troops Pour Into Eastern Europe by Jason Ditz, October 26, 2016 Share This 
A day after reports NATO was soliciting even more ground troops for their deployment into Eastern Europe, officials are reporting ‚Äúprogress‚Äù in recruiting more troops from more member nations to participate in the deployment, intended to be around 40,000 troops along the Baltic states, near Russia‚Äôs border. 
NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg claimed to have been ‚Äú very inspired ‚Äù by the response of nations he sought troops from, after yesterday‚Äôs report quoted diplomats as saying the deployment was meant to both ‚Äúconfront‚Äù Russia and to undercut Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump‚Äôs complaints NATO isn‚Äôt participating enough in its own defense. 
The new participants in the deployment include Albania, Slovenia, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Croatia, Belgium, and Norway. The size of individual deployments from different nations is unclear, but there will be four battalions, and the US is expected to provide the majority. 
With all these troops headed to the Baltic coast, reports out of Russia‚Äôs media suggest that they are planning some new warship deployments into their Baltic Fleet, with an eye toward enhancing their targeting capacity along the shore. Last 5 posts by Jason Ditz",1
Israel: Ancient Papyrus Proves Jerusalem Belongs to Israel,"Fragment of Old Tax Bill Meant to Undercut Muslims' Claim to Important Mosque by Jason Ditz, October 26, 2016 Share This 
While the UNESCO resolution which recognized the al-Aqsa Mosque in Jerusalem as a ‚ÄúMuslim holy site of worship‚Äù was barely reported around the world, and considered fairly non-controversial, Israeli officials have been expressing fury over the matter for two solid weeks. 
And the Muslims may have a huge, ancient mosque that has been a key part of Islam for 1,300 years, but Israel has a small strip of papyrus they found in a cave, which they‚Äôre pretty sure is a far more conclusive document, since it mentioned the word Jerusalem and was written in Hebrew. 
Israeli officials have claimed that the UNESCO resolution, in recognizing the mosque as important to Islam, was tantamount to denying Israel‚Äôs absolute and eternal control over the entire city of Jerusalem. Israeli Culture Minister Miri Regev said the papyrus strip proved Jerusalem ‚Äúwas and will remain the eternal capital of the Jewish people.‚Äù 
The al-Aqsa mosque was built on a site which is believed to have previously housed an important Jewish temple, and some Israelis advocate the eventual destruction of the mosque and the construction of a new temple, though the details of such a construction would be hugely religiously complicated, and since the destruction of the mosque would undoubtedly start a massive war, it is considered unlikely. Still, the far-right government wants to ensure that they have some international precedent for their claim to the territory. Last 5 posts by Jason Ditz",1
US Abstains From UN Vote Against Cuba Embargo,"Embargo Remains Politically Contentious Within the US   
For the first time ever, the US has abstained from the UN vote denouncing the ongoing US embargo of Cuba. The resolution passed through the general assembly 191-0, with the US and Israel the only ones abstaining. 
The UN has been voting overwhelmingly against the embargo for decades, but it is only in the past year that President Obama has started to criticize the embargo himself, and has sought to ease a lot of the long-standing restrictions on the island nation. 
The matter is hugely politically contentious within the US, however, with many in the Republican Congress condemning the White House for easing the restrictions, and the Congressional leadership so far preventing any more easing of the restrictions on commerce. 
The UN resolution itself is non-binding, and the real significance is not that it passed, but rather that the US abstained, which while reflecting the administration‚Äôs position is unusual, as it criticizes the US Congress internationally.  ",1
At Least 37 Killed in Yemen Fighting Since Ceasefire‚Äôs End,"Several Clashes Reported Around Country by Jason Ditz, October 26, 2016 Share This 
Fighting was reported in several areas around Yemen over the past 24 hours, with the ending of the 72-hour ceasefire leading to a substantial uptick in clashes in several areas, mostly in the northern half of the country. 
Three different incidents were reported, with the largest an exchange of artillery fire east of the capital city of Sanaa, in which 15 Houthis and 5 pro-Saudi fighters were slain. 11 more were killed in fighting at a border post, and six others were killed in Baida. 
The UN special envoy Ismail Ouid Cheikh Ahmed was in Yemen yesterday pushing proposals for a new peace process, though it as yet doesn‚Äôt appear that either side is willing to commit to anything, and only accepted the most recent 72-hour ceasefire because it came at the behest of US and British officials. 
Saudi Arabia attacked Yemen in March of 2015, vowing to reinstall former President Hadi in power. The war has continued since, with heavy airstrikes and a naval blockade, so far resulting in a split of the country along north-south boundaries, with the pro-Saudi forces centered on Aden, a southern port and former capital of South Yemen.

Iraqi Offensive South of Mosul Stalls as ISIS Resistance Grows,"Frontline Troops Forced to Wait for Reinforcements by Jason Ditz, October 26, 2016 Share This 
After 10 days of upbeat reports on the invasion of Mosul, Iraqi special forces south of the city have run into their first major obstacle, with heavy resistance from ISIS forcing them to pause their advance and wait for additional reinforcements. 
While officials are treating this as a brief pause, it effectively means that ISIS has temporarily broken the southern advance into Mosul, and that only the northern advance, the Kurdish forces are still approaching the city. 
That could be a huge problem for the Iraqi government, as in addition to fighting ISIS they‚Äôre in a bit of a territorial battle with the Kurdish Peshmerga. The Kurds have annexed a lot of territory they‚Äôve captured, and that could make the Mosul offensive something of a race. 
It also raises concerns about the Iraqi military‚Äôs readiness for the offensive, as in the past they have not reacted well to military setbacks. The ISIS forces have been deploying a large number of car bombs to try to slow the offensive, and the addition of machine gun and sniper fire has ultimately stopped the advance.

US: Kurdish Troops Will Be Involved in Invading ISIS Capital of Raqqa,"Turkish Objections Won't Stop YPG's Involvement by Jason Ditz, October 26, 2016 Share This 
US Lt. Gen. Stephen Townsend, the leader of the US military forces in Iraq and Syria , today announced that Kurdish YPG forces will participate in the invasion of the ISIS capital city of Raqqa, despite Turkish government demands that the Kurds not be allowed to take part. 
Townsend was a bit vague on the details of Kurdish involvement, saying the US are ‚Äúgoing to take this in steps,‚Äù and that Turkey has to realize the only way that the US is going to have enough force to take over Raqqa any time soon is with a significant portion of the YPG involved. 
Turkish Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu reiterated that his government wants only ‚Äúlocal forces‚Äù involved in the Raqqa battle, and that the YPG, who Turkey considers a terrorist organization, must not be allowed to take part in any way. 
Turkey‚Äôs military has been attacking the YPG in several locations around Syria over the past week, including heavy airstrikes which killed an estimated 200 YPG fighters who were engaged in an offensive against ISIS around Afrin. The Turkish government has repeatedly complained the YPG is gaining too much territory in Syria, and that they must abandon much of it. Last 5 posts by Jason Ditz",1
The End of Interventionism?,"Share This 
Looking over the global landscape, the areas most touched by US interventionist foreign policy are objectively in the worst, most desperate shape. The mainstream media will report that the current disaster in Syria came about because the people decided to stand up to a cruel dictator in the ‚ÄúArab Spring‚Äù that swept through the greater Middle East in 2011, and that the dictator cracked down so hard it caused the violence to spin out of control. We know, of course, that is not the whole story. The US had been involved in fomenting unrest in Syria at least five years or more before violence broke out. A WikiLeaks-released cable from 2006 shows how hard the US Embassy in Damascus was working to figure out a way to overthrow the government. Shortly after the partially manufactured protests devolved into violence, the CIA moved in and began arming (and importing) rebels to finish the deed. In five years the country has been destroyed, hundreds of thousands killed, millions left without homes. 
Likewise, even most critics of the 2003 US attack on Iraq will try to salvage the philosophy of interventionism by claiming the only reason democracy hasn‚Äôt broken out is that the US military didn‚Äôt occupy the country long enough! As if being occupied by a foreign power is the route to responsible governance and the development of civil society! 
There are too many other examples to mention, even little-discussed areas like Somalia and Nigeria ‚Äì with the latter falling prey to a radical Islamist gang, Boko Haram, that benefited from a region awash in weapons after the US-led attack on Libya opened the weapons depots. 
The US was actively involved in breaking up Sudan, which we were told was being run into the ground by ‚ÄúArabs‚Äù ruling from the north who were abusing black Africans in the south. I was once invited to lunch by the Sudanese ambassador to Washington while I was working on the Hill and he asked me, ‚Äúdo I look like an Arab to you?‚Äù Needless to say, I doubt anyone would have guessed he was not what the US government considered a ‚Äúblack African.‚Äù His point was that the dispute was being created artificially by external sources. In fact the US and its allies were determined to break the country up (hint: it had a lot to do with oil) and would settle for any pretext. The result has not been the peaceful South Sudan ruled locally that was promised. Instead the new country launched with the help of ‚Äúhumanitarian interventionists‚Äù like US Ambassador to the UN Samantha Power has proven to be orders of magnitude worse off than when it was under Khartoum‚Äôs rule. 
The track record of US interventionism is so universally disastrous that slowly but steadily the rest of the world is pushing back against a US foreign policy that is making their own lives less safe. Hungarian prime minister Viktor Orban, for example, gave an interview to a German newspaper recently in which he singled out US foreign policy as a force for harm rather than good in the world. 
Said Orban: 
America believes in the exportation of democracy. This sounds good; however, wherever it has been tried, entire regions often became destabilized, the consequences of which are suffering, death and migration. Additionally, often anti-democratic, extremist forces rose to power as a result of the free elections. 
Believing in the democracy export is arrogant because it fails to take the cultural structures of the given regions into consideration. But whether you like it or not, it is the culture that determines the political culture. 
That is pretty pointed criticism coming from a close NATO ally and the representative of a pro-US, center-right government. But this week the Hungarians celebrate the 60th anniversary of their 1956 revolution to extricate themselves from under the Soviet boot, so it is understandable that they have the idea of national sovereignty fresh in their minds. 
In a recent episode of Ron Paul‚Äôs Liberty Report, we discussed Philippines president Rodrigo Duterte‚Äôs announcement last week that he wanted to separate his country from domination by US foreign policy. The US has been determined to use the Philippines as a weapon in its arsenal against a China newly assertive in the South China Sea, but many in the Philippines ‚Äì the president included it seems ‚Äì see little benefit to going on war footing against a neighbor with your ally thousands of miles away. 
What can the interventionists offer when the fruits of their philosophy are laid bare? Lies and obfuscation. Manipulation of media messages. Demonization of those who oppose the neoconservatives and ‚Äúhumanitarian‚Äù interventionists who run Washington‚Äôs foreign policy. But as Dr. Paul has said with increasing frequency lately, their failure is our big opportunity. We must educate ourselves on their failures and we must train ourselves to make the case for a pure noninterventionist foreign policy as the only way to keep us safe.

What Happened to the FBI?,"Share This 
When FBI Director James Comey announced on July 5 that the Department of Justice would not seek the indictment of Hillary Clinton for failure to safeguard state secrets related to her email use while she was secretary of state, he both jumped the gun and set in motion a series of events that surely he did not intend. Was his hand forced by the behavior of FBI agents who wouldn‚Äôt take no for an answer? Did he let the FBI become a political tool? 
Here is the back story. 
The FBI began investigating the Clinton email scandal in the spring of 2015, when The New York Times revealed Clinton‚Äôs use of a private email address for her official governmental work and the fact that she did not preserve the emails on State Department servers, contrary to federal law. After an initial collection of evidence and a round of interviews, agents and senior managers gathered in the summer of 2015 to discuss how to proceed. It was obvious to all that a prima-facie case could be made for espionage, theft of government property and obstruction of justice charges. The consensus was to proceed with a formal criminal investigation. 
Six months later, the senior FBI agent in charge of that investigation resigned from the case and retired from the FBI because he felt the case was going ""sideways""; that‚Äôs law enforcement jargon for ""nowhere by design."" John Giacalone had been the chief of the New York City, Philadelphia and Washington, D.C., field offices of the FBI and, at the time of his ""sideways"" comment, was the chief of the FBI National Security Branch. 
The reason for the ""sideways"" comment must have been Giacalone‚Äôs realization that DOJ and FBI senior management had decided that the investigation would not work in tandem with a federal grand jury. That is nearly fatal to any government criminal case. In criminal cases, the FBI and the DOJ cannot issue subpoenas for testimony or for tangible things; only grand juries can. 
Giacalone knew that without a grand jury, the FBI would be toothless, as it would have no subpoena power. He also knew that without a grand jury, the FBI would have a hard time persuading any federal judge to issue search warrants. A judge would perceive the need for search warrants to be not acute in such a case because to a judge, the absence of a grand jury can only mean a case is ""sideways"" and not a serious investigation. 
As the investigation dragged on in secret and Donald Trump simultaneously began to rise in the Republican presidential primaries, it became more apparent to Giacalone‚Äôs successors that the goal of the FBI was to exonerate Clinton, not determine whether there was enough evidence to indict her. In late spring of this year, agents began interviewing the Clinton inner circle. 
When Clinton herself was interviewed on July 2 ‚Äì for only four hours, during which the interviewers seemed to some in the bureau to lack aggression, passion and determination ‚Äì some FBI agents privately came to the same conclusion as their former boss: The case was going sideways. 
A few determined agents were frustrated by Clinton‚Äôs professed lack of memory during her interview and her oblique reference to a recent head injury she had suffered as the probable cause of that. They sought to obtain her medical records to verify the gravity of her injury and to determine whether she had been truthful with them. They prepared the paperwork to obtain the records, only to have their request denied by Director Comey himself on July 4. 
Then some agents did the unthinkable; they reached out to colleagues in the intelligence community and asked them to obtain Clinton‚Äôs medical records so they could show them to Comey. We know that the National Security Agency can access anything that is stored digitally, including medical records. These communications took place late on July 4. 
When Comey learned of these efforts, he headed them off the next morning with his now infamous news conference, in which he announced that Clinton would not be indicted because the FBI had determined that her behavior, though extremely careless, was not reckless, which is the legal standard in espionage cases. He then proceeded to recount the evidence against her. He did this, no doubt, to head off the agents who had sought the Clinton medical records, whom he suspected would leak evidence against her. 
Three months later ‚Äì and just weeks before Clinton will probably be elected president ‚Äì we have learned that President Barack Obama regularly communicated with Clinton via her personal email servers about matters that the White House considered classified. That means that he lied when he told CBS News that he learned of the Clinton servers when the rest of us did. 
We also learned this week that Andrew McCabe, Giacalone‚Äôs successor as head of the FBI Washington field office and presently the No. 3 person in the FBI, is married to a woman to whom the Clinton money machine in Virginia funneled about $675,000 in lawful campaign funds for a failed 2015 run for the Virginia Senate. Comey apparently saw no conflict or appearance of impropriety in having the person in charge of the Clinton investigation in such an ethically challenged space. 
Why did this case go sideways? 
Did President Obama fear being a defense witness at Hillary Clinton‚Äôs criminal trial? Did he so fear being succeeded in office by Donald Trump that he ordered the FBI to exonerate Clinton, the rule of law be damned? Did the FBI lose its reputation for fidelity to law, bravery under stress and integrity at all times? 
This is not your grandfather‚Äôs FBI ‚Äì or your father‚Äôs. It is the Obama FBI.

UN‚Äôs Yemen Peace Plan Would Sideline Former President Hadi,"Hadi Would Be Figurehead to Placate Saudis by Jason Ditz, October 27, 2016 Share This 
Heavily backed by Saudi Arabia, former Yemeni President Abd-Rabbu Mansour Hadi‚Äôs ambition to return as the ruler of Yemen appears to be waning, with a new UN peace plan proposal making the rounds that would sideline him more or less entirely. 
Hadi‚Äôs position has been contentious from the start. ‚ÄúElected‚Äù in 2012 in a UN-mandated vote in which no opposition was allowed, Hadi was supposed to serve two years in office leading to a new constitution and free elections. The constitution never happened, and Hadi extended his reign unilaterally in 2014. He resigned in January 2015 when his anti-Houthi military offensive turned sour and he lost the capital. 
The Saudis, primarily opposed to the Houthis because they‚Äôre Shi‚Äôites, insists to this day that Hadi remains the rightful ruler, and in March 2015 attacked Yemen, vowing to reinstall him. While the Houthis have expressed openness to a unity government that ends the conflict, they‚Äôve also opposed it involving Hadi or his vice president Ali Mushin Ahmar, who they say were too corrupt to work with in a transitional government. 
The UN plan seems largely to agree, as it would require Ahmar to resign outright, and would allow Hadi to remain only as a figurehead with no real power, instead seeking to stack the government with people both sides are likely to accept. 
The decision to leave Hadi in at all appears to be designed to placate the Saudis, who vowed to reinstall him through their war, and would be able to claim that they succeeded under this deal, even if it ultimately means Hadi doesn‚Äôt get any power. Last 5 posts by Jason Ditz",1
US Claims Four Arms Ships From Iran to Yemen Caught in Past 18 Months,"Share This 
Vice Admiral Kevin Donegan today claimed the US and other members of the Saudi-led naval blockade of Yemen had captured four ships with arms which they are claiming both came from Iran and were bound for Yemen, where they would‚Äôve delivered the weapons to the Houthi movement. 
The vice admiral claimed the US ‚Äúknows‚Äù both where the ships came from and where they were going because they interviewed the crews of the captured ships. Only one of the four putative weapons ships was validated by the United Nations as being an actual smuggling attempt. 
Donegan went on to claim that he believes Iran is ‚Äúconnected in some way‚Äù to recent incidents of missiles fired at a US ship off the Yemeni coast, though the Pentagon conceded one of those incidents likely never happened, and he offered no evidence of Iranian involvement in anything else. 
The allegations were likely made by way of justifying US attacks on the Yemeni coast, as well as justifying Saudi Arabia‚Äôs ongoing naval blockade of Yemen, which Saudi Arabia recently denied is happening.  ",1
Putin: Russia Is Not Going to Attack Anyone,"Claims of Russian Threats 'Simply Stupid' by Jason Ditz, October 27, 2016 Share This 
Complaining about Western ‚Äúhysteria‚Äù surrounding repeated predictions of Russian military attacks on NATO member nations, Russian President Vladimir Putin sought to resolve two solid years of predictions to that effect with a straightforward assurance that ‚ÄúRussia is not going to attack anyone .‚Äù 
Putin accused Western nations of having ‚Äúmythical, dreamt-up problems,‚Äù and insisted the idea that Russia was going to attack the West was ‚Äú simply stupid and unrealistic .‚Äù He added that he believes the idea is being played up to justify bigger military spending. 
The Russian president also sought to dismiss allegations that he is plotting to rig the US elections to his own benefit, noting that the US is a great power and not some banana republic with an easily manipulated political system. Russia has repeatedly denied involvement in such plots. 
NATO has played up the Russian threat to justify sending over 40,000 ground troops to the Russian border, with ever-growing numbers announced all the time. Such predictions started after the ouster of a pro-Russian government in Ukraine led to a civil war in that country‚Äôs east, with NATO military leaders repeatedly predicting Russian tanks rolling across Ukraine into NATO countries.

US: 800-900 ISIS ‚ÄòProbably‚Äô Killed in Mosul Fighting,"Forces Still Several Kilometers From Mosul by Jason Ditz, October 27, 2016 Share This 
Adding to the upbeat official assessment of the invasion of Mosul, Centcom chief Gen. Joseph Votel today told the press that he believes the forces involved have ‚Äú probably killed about 800-900 ISIS fighters ‚Äù in the past week and a half. 
By contrast, Votel insisted that only 57 Iraqi troops were killed, and another 30 Kurdish Peshmerga. Unmentioned was a US soldier also killed in the fighting, embedded with the Peshmerga and killed by a roadside bomb north of Mosul. 
It is difficult to get accurate information on ISIS casualties, and the official figures from Iraqi officials are almost always dramatically overstated in an effort to sell the war as a runaway success. There are reasons to be skeptical about the 800-900 figure, however. 
The main reason is that Iraqi and Kurdish forces are still several kilomters away from the outskirts of Mosul, mostly occupying empty villages, and while ISIS has sent out some forces of skirmishers to slow their advance, it is believed the vast majority of their defensive forces have remained in Mosul, gearing up for the eventual attack and setting assorted traps.

US Commander: We Must Conquer Raqqa Before ISIS Launches Attacks on West,"Insists US Has 'Sense of Urgency' in Taking Over ISIS Capital by Jason Ditz, October 27, 2016 Share This 
US officials in the past few days have kept talking up an imminent invasion of the ISIS capital city of Raqqa, despite so much focus presently on Mosul, and despite the obvious huge problems its going to cause between Turkey and the Kurdish YPG. 
Lt. Gen. Stephen Townsend, the US commander in Iraq, insists the US has decided it doesn‚Äôt have a choice in the matter, and feels a ‚Äú sense of urgency ‚Äù to take over Raqqa before any of the ISIS leadership in that city is able to plan any retaliatory strikes against Western targets. 
‚ÄúWe‚Äôve got to get to Raqqa pretty soon,‚Äù Townsend insisted, claiming that the capture of Manbij a couple of months ago uncovered ISIS plots to attack France and the US, and they are convinced even more plots are ongoing within Raqqa. 
ISIS is estimated to have around 4,000 troops in Raqqa, and the attack will require the Kurdish YPG to commit substantial portions of its force to the area. That‚Äôs problematic, because Turkey has in the past attacked them when they were fighting ISIS, and has warned the US not to allow any Kurds into Raqqa. Last 5 posts by Jason Ditz",1
US to Hold Off on Cyberwar With Russia Until After Election,"Rep. Schiff: US Doesn't Want to Provoke Retaliation Before Vote by Jason Ditz, October 27, 2016 Share This 
While the Obama Administration has made much of its intention to start a full-scale cyberwar against Russia at a ‚Äútime of their choosing,‚Äù the most recent reports suggest that the war is effectively on hold at least until the presidential election in two weeks. 
From President Obama‚Äôs standpoint, the hope is to work with Hillary Clinton, if she becomes president-elect, to launch a cyber war that they both can get behind. Indeed, both have appeared very hawkish against Russia, and Obama apparently doesn‚Äôt want to deny Clinton a chance to participate in the early days of a war she‚Äôd inherit. 
Starting a cyberwar ahead of a Trump win would be even less wise, as Trump has opposed the idea of picking fights with Russia, and expressed strong doubts about Democratic Party ‚Äúcertainty‚Äù that Russia is behind hacks against them. 
Rep. Adam Schiff (D ‚Äì CA), the ranking Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee, says that another factor is concern about provoking Russian retaliation for such a US attack before the vote, with many Democrats concerned Russia could release ‚Äúforged‚Äù documents to embarrass the Clinton campaign. 
Earlier this month, Vice President Joe Biden reported that he has informed Russia of an imminent retaliatory hack, and says the Obama Administration will pick a time which will ‚Äúhave the greatest impact.‚Äù Russia has denied any involvement in the hacks. Last 5 posts by Jason Ditz",1
Turkey‚Äôs Rivalry With Kurds Likely to Complicate Raqqa Invasion,"Turkey Repeatedly Demanded US Not Allow Kurds to Participate by Jason Ditz, October 27, 2016 Share This 
US officials are making clear that they intend to invade Raqqa really soon, with the ISIS capital scheduled to be attacks in the middle of the ongoing offensive against the city of Mosul. But while the Mosul invasion has a coalition of at least sort of friendly factions participating. No such coalition exists for Raqqa. 
Indeed, the US has insisted that the Kurdish YPG will be the overwhelming majority of the force, because they‚Äôre the only force available in the area with enough fighters to realistically attack the city. Yet Turkey has been outright livid over this, and has repeatedly demanded that the Kurds not be allowed anywhere near Raqqa. 
Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan insists his country will be invading Raqqa, along with the YPG-held city of Manbij, very soon, and while they‚Äôll doubtless also do some fighting against ISIS on the way, it‚Äôs pretty clear this is going to include some heavy fighting with the Kurds . 
That‚Äôs likely to complicate, and potentially outright derail, the invasion of Raqqa, as the Kurdish YPG can‚Äôt fight ISIS and Turkey at the same time, and the US seems wholly incapable of keeping Turkey from launching attacks on the Kurds in the middle of anti-ISIS operations.

Those Fleeing Mosul Face Summary Execution,"Troops Brag of Having Shot Some Fleeing Mosul by Jason Ditz, October 27, 2016 Share This 
While UN officials claim they‚Äôre carefully monitoring the treatment of those displaced from Mosul and haven‚Äôt documented any abuses, the troops occupying checkpoints through which the civilians have to flee are telling a different story, involving mass detentions and summary execution. 
The Associated Press quoted one of those manning a checkpoint, named Dhia Amir, as having bragged of not only ‚Äúarresting‚Äù over 100 people, handing them over to police forces, but of having personally shot and killed two men who he claims to have ‚Äúknown‚Äù were fleeing ISIS fighters. 
This has been a recurring problem in Iraq‚Äôs wars against ISIS, as Shi‚Äôite dominated security forces and allied militias are immediately distrustful of Sunni Arabs fleeing the ISIS cities, and don‚Äôt need much pretext for a detention, or to disappear people outright. 
‚ÄúA 13-year-old boy can still kill,‚Äù Amir noted, defending the crackdown on fleeing civilians. ‚ÄúAnd even if he doesn‚Äôt kill me, one day he could kill my son.‚Äù That, ultimately, has been the basis on which much of the war has been fought, and the main reason why sectarian tensions are only growing.

"Russian, US Jets in ‚ÄòNear Miss‚Äô Over Syria","Air Force General Attributes It to Lousy Russian Pilot by Jason Ditz, October 28, 2016 Share This 
The US Air Force is claiming a ‚Äú near miss ‚Äù in the skies of Syria last week, in which a Russian jet that was escorting a spy plane came within ‚Äúhalf a mile‚Äù of a US warplane. The incident was at night and none of the planes had any lights on. 
US Air Force Lt. Gen. Jeff Harrigian chalked the matter up to inferior Russian pilots, saying that it was because the pilot did not have ‚Äúthe necessary situational awareness‚Äù and simply didn‚Äôt see that there was a US warplane flying around in the area. 
The US is eager to hype any such incidents as proof of Russia‚Äôs ‚Äúunsafe and unprofessional behavior‚Äù in Syria, though a major factor in this is that the US dramatically curtailed information sharing with Russia in Syria after the last ceasefire failed. 
Details on the incident are still minimal, but it was described as happening in ‚Äúeastern Syria.‚Äù This is unusual because, while Russian warplanes tend to operate in that area, where al-Qaeda‚Äôs Nusra Front holds significant territory, the US generally does not, and US airstrikes are more or less exclusively in the northwest of the country.

"US Drone Strike in Afghanistan Kills, Wounds Several Civilians","Attack Targeted Home of Suspected 'Taliban Commander' by Jason Ditz, October 28, 2016 Share This 
A US drone strike has killed and wounded a number of civilians in Afghanistan‚Äôs Nangarhar Province today, though exact numbers are as yet unclear, with officials claiming that the home at the center of the attack was owned by a suspected Taliban commander. 
The putative commander does not appear to have been among the casualties, though at least four people were killed within the house, and the blast also wounded a number of people in the surrounding area. At least seven children and five women are in the hospital for treatment related to the strike. 
Official Afghan statements only labeled the 12 wounded as civilians, and everyone else was not a civilian. Locals offered varying estimates, and the Taliban claimed two civilians killed and over 30 wounded in their own report on the attack. 
The Nangarhar Province has been heavily targeted by US warplanes over the past several months, though generally trying to tamp down a growing ISIS faction therein. The Taliban has had a presence in Nangarhar throughout the US occupation, as indeed they have almost everywhere along the Pakistan border. Last 5 posts by Jason Ditz",1
Putin Rejects Russian Army‚Äôs Calls to Resume Aleppo Airstrikes,"Putin Still Hopes to See Moderate Rebels Separated From Nusra Front by Jason Ditz, October 28, 2016 Share This 
Russian President Vladimir Putin has officially rejected a request from his nation‚Äôs Defense Ministry to endorse a resumption of Russian airstrikes against the Syrian city of Aleppo, after 10 straight days of no Russian airstrikes being conducted. 
Russia launched a brief ceasefire in Aleppo last week, and extended it for four days. Even after it officially expired, they have not resumed strikes against the city, with officials saying they want to convince Western nations to separate the moderate rebel factions within East Aleppo from the al-Qaeda-linked Nusra Front. 
So far that‚Äôs not been working so well, as indeed separating the two was the primary goal of a weeklong ceasefire a month ago, and a public US call to separate never amounted to anything. After that, the idea appears to have been given up on by the US, and Russia has also sought Turkey and Saudi Arabia‚Äôs influence on the more moderate factions. 
As the rebel factions are launching a new offensive trying to brief the Aleppo siege, the Russian defense ministry has gone to the unusual step of publicly announcing their request to Putin, and Putin‚Äôs very public rejection may suggest there is some debate within the Russian leadership on how to proceed.

Nusra Front Launches New Offensive Around Syria‚Äôs Aleppo,"Offensive Aims to Reopen Supply Lines to Nusra-Held East by Jason Ditz, October 28, 2016 Share This 
With al-Qaeda‚Äôs Nusra Front losing territory in recent weeks around Aleppo, and seeing their main stronghold in the city‚Äôs east increasingly surrounded, the group and some of its allies have launched a new offensive south of the city aimed at opening the supply lines back up. 
Clashes have been reported throughout the day in several areas around government-held western Aleppo , with the attackers coming from further west, likely reinforcements from Nusra‚Äôs main territory, the Idlib Province. Locals described substantial fighting. 
This has been a recurring feature in the battle over Aleppo since 2012, but particularly over the past several months, with each side getting a sizeable advantage only to lose it to a sudden counterattack from the other, leaving the civilian population trapped within. 
Over the past few weeks, however, it had seemed like Aleppo was really going to be reunified by the military, with Nusra forces on their heels and Russia feeling confident enough to put their airstrikes on hold. Russian President Vladimir Putin has ordered the ceasefire to continue, despite calls from the military to resume attacks. 
Exactly how far the latest offensive has gotten is a major of debate, with Nusra claiming they‚Äôd captured a suburb that amounts to the whole southwestern corner of Aleppo, and government officials denying that they‚Äôd lost anywhere near so much. As usual, it will take some time for this to shake out and become clear what territory changed hands. Last 5 posts by Jason Ditz",1
Malaysia to Buy Ships From China in Another Blow to US Regional Dominance,"US Keen to Keep South China Sea Nations Buying From Them, Not China by Jason Ditz, October 28, 2016 Share This 
United States determination to keep its South China Sea territorial disputes with China going rests heavily on having nations with active claims in the sea as US client states, particularly those with claims that conflict with China‚Äôs. That used to be, with several nations having such claims. 
But the US is struggling to keep those nations exclusively buying US arms. Today‚Äôs big loss was from Malaysia , which has announced they intend to buy littoral mission ships from China, instead of the United States. Details on the decision-making process are unclear, but the US problems with their own littoral combat ships breaking down, so that might‚Äôve hurt their chances. 
It‚Äôs a comparatively small deal, but part of a growing trend. Philippines President Rodrigo Duterte has been making headlines for weeks with his interest in ending long-standing reliance on the US. While this has grown into complaints about general US-Philippines relations, one of the early grievances was his not liking the US dictating arms sales, and expressing interest in buying from China and Russia instead. 
If these countries start buying their arms from China, they‚Äôll have a strong incentive to resolve maritime disputes with China diplomatically, which could severely limit their interest in having warships patrolling through the area to ‚Äúconfront‚Äù China. Last 5 posts by Jason Ditz",1
Shi‚Äôite Militias Join Iraq‚Äôs Mosul Attack,"Militia Fighters to Advance on Areas West of City by Jason Ditz, October 28, 2016 Share This 
After a week and a half of assuring everyone that their role in the invasion of Mosul would be very limited, and removed from the Sunni population, Iraq‚Äôs Shi‚Äôite militias have been announced to have launched an offensive west of Mosul, advancing on Tal Afar . 
According to officials, the main goal of this offensive is to cut the city of Mosul off from ISIS territory in Syria, preventing the ISIS fighters within the city from fleeing west if the battle begins to turn sour. The offensive is said to start ‚Äúwithin a few days or hours.‚Äù 
The involvement of Shi‚Äôite militias in the ‚Äúliberation‚Äù of Sunni Arab cities in Iraq has been controversial because they often end up carrying out extrajudicial executions, looting and torture of locals they suspect of being secretly in league with ISIS. 
An effort to block flight from Mosul to ISIS territory is Syria would be an obvious step, but the militias‚Äô involvement again risks targeting of civilians, as the population of from Mosul is already overrunning the minimal camps set up for the displaced. 
Civilians fleeing these cities are usually not welcomed in Iraqi government-held territory, and wind up fleeing into other ISIS-held territory. With little left in Iraq, this likely means fleeing into Syria, and the militias‚Äô presence means the civilians displaced by the attack are likely to be targeted for fleeing ‚Äúwith‚Äù ISIS.

Amnesty Warns Against Using White Phosphorus in Attack on Mosul,"Notes Evidence of Use Northeast of Mosul by   
With Iraqi forces continuing to near the city of Mosul in a protracted military offensive, there are more than a few concerns about potential war crimes against the massive civilian population in the ISIS-held city. Today, Amnesty International‚Äôs concern centers on white phosphorus . 
White phosphorus is legally used both for smoke screens and for illumination in war zones, its use is often heavily criticized for the risk of civilian casualties in the intense temperature the chemical burns at. Its use in areas where civilians are present is considered a war crime. 
This is particularly true around Mosul, a huge city in which some 1.5 million people are believed to still reside. Amnesty noted it has photographic evidence of the use of the chemical to the northeast of Mosul, and warned against any further use in areas where civilians are present or may be present in the near future. 
US forces have been documented using white phosphorus recently in Iraq, though they insist they‚Äôve only done so in ways consistent with their interpretation of international law. The US, of course, insists everything they do in Iraq is legal, but in the case of such a densely populated area, this could be a big problem.  ",1
Israel‚Äôs Blockade of Gaza Is Inherently Violent,"Share This 
This fall, the U.S. agreed to provide $38 billion in military aid to Israel over the next ten years, ensuring America‚Äôs continued role in funding the occupation of Palestine. Meanwhile, my friends and colleagues here in Gaza live in fear of another significant Israeli attack in the near future. 
They have every reason to fear another major escalation ‚Äì violence is a daily reality in Gaza. In two recent incidents, a rocket was fired from Gaza into Israel without causing damage or injuries, and in both instances Israel responded by bombing targets throughout Gaza. 
In August alone, Israel bombed more than 50 locations in the small territory . 
The simple story told about these events focuses on action and reaction: Palestinians attacked Israel with a rocket and Israel responded. We hear this logic after nearly every event of this sort, but it‚Äôs woefully incomplete. 
In both instances, the rockets fired weren‚Äôt fired by Hamas, but rather by small radical armed groups at odds with Hamas, which governs Gaza. These groups seek to incite Israeli attacks on Hamas with the goal of destabilizing its control over Gaza, because they see Hamas as too comfortable with the status quo. 
Since seizing power in 2007, Hamas has worked to control and limit violence from the territory. Outside of periods of defined military escalation ‚Äì which tend to be precipitated by Israeli attacks ‚Äì they have effectively stopped attacks against Israel from Gaza. 
This explains why, as noted by the Israeli press, there were only 14 rockets fired from Gaza towards Israel between January and August this year. None were fired by Hamas, so Israel‚Äôs decision to target Hamas as a response makes no sense. 
Of course, 14 rockets fired from Gaza is 14 too many for those of us committed to ending all violence, and none of this should be taken as an apology for other violence perpetrated by Hamas. 
But, as the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs in the occupied Palestinian territories reports , there were also 45 Israeli military incursions into Gaza this year, resulting in 7 Palestinian deaths and, on average, injuring five Palestinians in Gaza every week. 
This is the part of the story that isn‚Äôt told. 
Gaza also remains under an Israeli-imposed blockade that severely limits travel, trade, and life for Gazans. Despite assurances that restrictions would be lifted in the 2014 Hamas-Israel ceasefire agreement, the blockade remains in effect. 
Israel, with support from the US government, claims this decades-long blockade is in place to pressure the people of Gaza to rise up against Hamas and provide security for Israelis. 
If those are Israel‚Äôs raisons d‚Äôetre, then it‚Äôs a complete failure. It hasn‚Äôt stopped violence, it hasn‚Äôt weakened Hamas, and it hasn‚Äôt brought Israelis or Palestinians security. 
While the blockade hasn‚Äôt succeeded in achieving the changes Israel claims to be seeking, its impact on the civilian population of Gaza has been immense. 
Over two years after the end of the last large military operation there, much of Gaza remains in ruins. 
Of the 100,000 Palestinians in Gaza who were displaced during the 2014 Israeli bombardment, over 65,000 remain homeless, as 70 percent of the homes seriously damaged or destroyed haven‚Äôt been rebuilt. This is largely because reconstruction materials remain blocked from entering Gaza. 
This important context is too often missing as US pundits and politicians consider the situation in Gaza. 
Given the blockade and regular military incursions imposed by Israel, the firing of less than 2 rockets per month by Palestinians cannot be seen as the core reason for violence. 
If the US is serious about promoting peace between Israelis and Palestinians, preventing future violence in Gaza, and guaranteeing security, then it must recognize the violence inherent in the Israeli occupation and end the blockade. 
The next attack on Gaza, feared by my friends who live there, is an inevitable reality if nothing changes.

Girl Soldiers: Forgotten Casualties of War,"Share This 
As secretary of State, Hillary Clinton was visibly shaken by sexual crimes against women and girls when she visited the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) in 2009. Sexual crimes in this central African country, known as the ‚Äúrape capital of the world,‚Äù include the sexual exploitation of tens of thousands of girls abducted and trapped as child soldiers. Nonetheless, since 2010, President Obama has waived a congressionally mandated ban on military aid to countries known to exploit child soldiers, among them the DRC. 
The DRC‚Äôs eastern region is exceedingly rich in rare minerals and exceedingly rife with decades of brutal war over those minerals. This country and three others ‚Äì Nigeria, Somalia and South Sudan ‚Äì each of which exploits thousands of child soldiers, will receive more than $161 million in U.S. military aid in fiscal year 2016. 
The Child Soldier Prevention Act of 2008 bans the US government from providing military resources and aid to countries that use soldiers younger than 18; it allows a presidential waiver in cases of ‚Äúnational interest,‚Äù however. But what possible ‚Äúnational interest‚Äù can override the lives of tens of thousands of children shattered in the worst of childhood nightmares ‚Äì lives of being forced to torture, kill and rape, and in the case of girls, lives of being serially raped and impregnated? 
The Reality 
At any given time, about 300,000 children between the ages of 8 and 18 are exploited as child soldiers in scores of civil and international conflicts in Africa, Asia and Colombia. In Sierra Leone‚Äôs civil war (1991-2001), 80 percent of fighters were between 7 and 15 years old; in Liberia‚Äôs conflict (1989-2003), up to 70 percent of government and rebel troops were children. Forty percent of soldiers slain in Colombia were children; the Lord‚Äôs Resistance Army in Uganda is mainly composed of children. They are abducted from agricultural fields, or taken en route to school or market, or when their village is attacked. Others join for reasons of extreme poverty and hunger; fleeing family abuse; revenge for enemy brutality upon their family; being drawn to a popular cause; and, in the case of some boys, as a way to garner respect from male elders. In-depth investigators of child soldiers conclude , ‚Äú‚Ä¶ never before in the history of warfare have children been so exploited on such a vast scale.‚Äù 
What most people do not realize is how many child soldiers are girls ‚Äì an estimated 40 percent, who are exploited, like boy soldiers, as servants, cooks, porters, spies, human shields, suicide bombers and fighters. In Sri Lanka, more than 43 percent of 50,000 children in armed groups were girls, a finding determined during peace talks between warring parties and UNICEF and documented by journalist Jimmie Briggs . Deepening their trauma, girls are taken into sexual slavery by boy soldiers, adult soldiers and commanders and, in some cases, sold in exchange for weapons. Given the popular image of boys as child soldiers, hundreds of thousands of girls constitute an invisible army and ‚Äúforgotten casualties of war‚Äù in the rehabilitation process following the cessation of armed conflict. 
Armed groups target children for wars because children ‚Äì and particularly girls, because of sex discrimination ‚Äì are obedient, vulnerable and malleable. Children can be more easily indoctrinated into being the next generation of armed rebels and terrorists. Child soldiers are cheap because they are unpaid and eat less than adults; and they provide functions such as cooking, cleaning and portering, thus freeing up adult soldiers for more rigorous fighting. With the prevalence of light but deadly weapons, both girls and boys are trained for combat. In a 2002 survey, nearly half the interviewed girls in armed groups described their primary role as ‚Äúfighter.‚Äù 
Despite their utility as fighters and servants, girl soldiers are raped, prostituted, mutilated, infected with sexually transmitted diseases including HIV/AIDS, and made pregnant by soldiers. Many are permanently injured and will suffer lifelong pain as a result of multiple rapes and untreated infections. Returning to their villages and homes, numerous girls have reported that they are rejected as filthy and immoral, and they are blamed for disgracing family and community honor. Even more shunned are girls who return pregnant or with children born of rape. Losing family and social support, they are compelled to turn to prostitution or stay with an abusive ex-soldier ‚Äúhusband‚Äù in order to raise their child and survive. 
Moreover, even after commitments to release child soldiers, armed groups often refuse to give up girls, holding them captive as ‚Äúwives.‚Äù Thus, the full cycle of misogyny entraps girls: ruthlessly violated as child soldiers, ostracized when returning home and often not released in the ‚Äúpeace‚Äù process. 
Fifteen-year-old Grace Akallo was abducted in 1996 with 29 other high school girls from her boarding school dormitory at St. Mary‚Äôs College Kisubi in northern Uganda by warlord Joseph Kony and rebel soldiers of the Lord‚Äôs Resistance Army. Physically, the girls were pushed to the point of death, walking barefoot, given little food and water and beaten with sticks and the butts of rifles. And spiritually, they were driven to the point of death, forced to torture and kill other children ‚Äì sometimes a sibling ‚Äì in a seasoning process designed to dehumanize them, extinguish their consciences and break their wills. Kony forced the girls to train with AK-47s. He also distributed them among his commanders as ‚Äúwives.‚Äù They were expected to fight even with babies strapped to their backs. 
Akallo was given to a man ‚Äúolder than her father,‚Äù who on first encounter seized her and raped her. ‚ÄúI felt like a thorn was in my skin as my innocence was destroyed,‚Äù she wrote of his sexual violence. In her community, the stigma of rape is so extreme that ex-girl soldiers will admit to murder before they will admit to having been raped. 
In contrast to the outcast plight of girl soldiers, many boy soldiers earn a manly status in their communities. Leymah Gbowee, the Liberian Nobel Peace Prize laureate, works with ex-child soldiers from Charles Taylor‚Äôs army during Liberia‚Äôs civil war. Joseph, a boy she counseled, explained that he became a child soldier because ‚Äúboys who joined the rebellion came back and were really respected and were often seen in the company of the elders and community leaders.‚Äù 
Gbowee is convinced that the nexus between violence, weapons and manhood is responsible for drawing many former boy soldiers into the brutal, macho cycle of war. Many of the girls she assisted were ‚Äúchild wives‚Äù of the ex-soldiers and had been abducted, raped and beaten into submission. With no exit , each girl was ‚Äúcaught up in a spiral of one individual trying to prove his maleness. ‚Ä¶ The abuse women suffer during conflict is a reflection of the interaction between men and women, boys and girls, during peace time.‚Äù 
Compounding the excruciating burdens of girl soldiers is the failure of the disarmament, demobilization and reintegration programs of the United Nations and international nongovernmental organizations ‚Äì programs intended to help former child soldiers with education, job skills and fitting back into society. Save the Children‚Äôs 2005 report, ‚ÄúForgotten Casualties of War: Girls in Armed Conflict,‚Äù concludes that girls are caught between ‚Äúrecrimination from the armed group if they leave and from the community if they return home‚Äù and are invisible in the reintegration programs. The misogyny and neglect on all sides has sent many of them into prostitution for survival or resulted in their suicides. Former girl soldiers are more than twice as likely to commit suicide as their male counterparts. 
The Fiction 
For an exercise in unreality and moral depravity, Google images of ‚Äúgirl soldiers.‚Äù You will find a garbage heap of pornographic pictures: cartoons of large-breasted women with big thighs and some muscles, barely clothed, wielding a gun in each hand, looking like (so-called) ‚Äúhappy hookers‚Äù costumed for Armed Services Day. Sprinkled among these are photos of young female soldiers, hanging out passively, like decorations, among male soldiers. Of the first 200 images I perused, a handful portrayed real girl soldiers ‚Äì serious beyond years with sad-to-death eyes. Yet even these photos lacked the gruesome reality of the tens of thousands of girls entrapped in armies and militias. 
For contrast, Google images of ‚Äúchild soldiers.‚Äù Ninety-five percent of these images are boys. All are realistic war photos: children carrying, aiming and shooting weapons sometimes taller than they are; roaming streets in search of prey; poised to kill, faces deadly serious, some hardened, some older than their years, others still bearing traces of their stolen childhood. No airbrushed or pornographic reality on this site. Only a crucial omission: Real girl soldiers ‚Äì who constitute up to 40 percent of child soldiers and suffer the most vile sexual violation and rejection ‚Äì are missing . 
We in the United States need a national floodlight on the issue of child soldiers. Employing children, by whatever means, in armed conflict is an crime against humanity recognized by the International Criminal Court. Forty percent of funding available for the rehabilitation of child soldiers should be dedicated to the reintegration of girls within their communities. Leaders who use child soldiers should be prosecuted and indicted. We need to research countries that traffic in arms and whose businesses invest in or conduct trade with countries that use child soldiers. And violators should be publicized, stigmatized and boycotted. 
We need to frame and shame the hypocrisy of passing a law to protect children caught in conflict and then violating it for that morbid excuse of ‚Äúnational security‚Äù ‚Äì a coverall for American militarism, xenophobia, torture, erasure of civil rights and sexual exploitation. Otherwise, political statements that women‚Äôs rights are human rights are a sham.

"Budgeting the Good War, for 75 Years","Share This 
Today we call it the status quo, or endless war, or we just don‚Äôt bother to notice it. Indeed, now more than ever we don‚Äôt notice it. It‚Äôs barely part of the 2016 election, even though we‚Äôre engaged in active conflict in half a dozen countries, toying with a relaunch of the Cold War with Russia and, of course, hemorrhaging, as always, more than half our annual discretionary budget on ‚Äúdefense.‚Äù 
World War II has been going on for seven decades now and has no intention of ever stopping . . . of its own volition. But this year‚Äôs rocking electoral craziness ‚Äì not just Hurricane Donald, but the unexpected staying power of the Bernie Sanders campaign ‚Äì may well be the harbinger of transcendence. Apparently there‚Äôs another force in the universe capable of standing up to the American, indeed, the global, military-industrial status quo. 
Slowly, slowly this force is organizing itself and taking human shape. This isn‚Äôt a simple process. After all, the game of empire ‚Äì the game called war, the game of domination ‚Äì has been coalescing political power for several thousand years now. 
But our current military budget was birthed by the wars of the 20th century. William Hartung , writing recently at TomDispatch, shows the fascinating connectedness of the wars that followed VE and VJ Days, as the corporate beneficiaries of the Big War aligned with mainstream politicians of both major parties and coalesced into the Washington consensus. Over the decades they have engaged in an ongoing struggle to maintain military spending at breathtakingly high levels and avoid any sort of transition to something called peace. 
The two pillars of this consensus, as Hartung points out, are the ideology of ‚Äúarmed exceptionalism,‚Äù that a shifting array of enemies are out there itching to destroy us, but we will persist in our mission to maintain order in every corner of the planet; and the ‚Äústrategic placement of arms production facilities and military bases in key states and Congressional districts,‚Äù ensuring entrenched political power for the arms lobby. 
So World War II initially, as we know, morphed into the Cold War, America‚Äôs crusade against communism, which was set into motion in 1950 by a long-classified report (NSC-68) prepared by the State and Defense departments and the CIA, urging the vigorous containment of Soviet expansion and the development of the hydrogen bomb. 
President Truman ‚Äúwas somewhat taken aback at the costs associated with the report‚Äôs recommendations,‚Äù according to history.com , and ‚Äúhe hesitated to publicly support a program that would result in heavy tax increases for the American public, particularly since the increase would be spent on defending the United States during a time of peace.‚Äù 
Peace! What a nuisance! But: ‚ÄúThank God Korea came along,‚Äù as an aide to Secretary of State Dean Acheson put it at the time. The Korean War gave the militarists the enemy they needed and the nuclear arms race, and so much else, was born. The military budget was set for decades. 
As Hartung points out, the next terrible hurdle the budget boys faced was in the wake of the Vietnam War, which ended in 1975. That war, and the universal draft that essentially pulled the whole country into a front-row seat for it, spawned a passionate antiwar movement and, ultimately, a moldering national disgust for war, known as Vietnam Syndrome. The Cold War continued, but the U.S. military was confined to proxy wars for a while and had to rethink its strategy. 
Two things happened. The universal draft was ended, removing most of the American middle class from a life-and-death stake in our military operations; and Saddam Hussein, our ally, was recast as Adolf Hitler. And in 1991, President George H.W. Bush embarked on a month of war with Iraq known as Operation Desert Storm. Not only did the US‚Äúwin‚Äù this war and kill over 100,000 Iraqis (and ultimately cause hideous health problems for American soldiers), but, perhaps most importantly: ‚ÄúBy God, we‚Äôve kicked the Vietnam Syndrome once and for all.‚Äù So the president proclaimed. 
Unfortunately for the war consensus, the Soviet Union dissolved a short time later and the Cold War ended . . . and a ‚Äúpeace dividend‚Äù loomed. Hartung notes that Gen. Colin Powell, then chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, expressed the situation thus: ‚ÄúI‚Äôm running out of demons. I‚Äôm running out of villains. I‚Äôm down to Castro and Kim Il-sung.‚Äù 
Would military spending be diverted to infrastructure repair, free education, universal health care? 
Well, no. The Bill Clinton presidency found a few new demons. It fought a war in Kosovo and, on the domestic front, vastly expanded the prison-industrial complex. Meanwhile, the neocon think tanks cogitated and one of them, the Project for a New American Century, reflecting the fact that geopolitical thinking had stopped with World War II, decided that what America needed was a new Pearl Harbor . And then came the presidency of George W. Bush, 9/11, and the Global War on Terror. And the US military budget was carved, seemingly, in stone. 
Barack Obama was elected president in 2008 on the promise of serious change, but any hope that he intended to upend W‚Äôs wars was soon dispelled. He dumped the name but kept the wars, essentially settling ‚Äúfor a no-name global war,‚Äù Hartung writes. ‚ÄúHe would shift gears from a strategy focused on large numbers of ‚Äòboots on the ground‚Äô to an emphasis on drone strikes, the use of Special Operations forces, and massive transfers of arms to US allies like Saudi Arabia. . . . (O)ne might call Obama‚Äôs approach ‚Äòpolitically sustainable warfare.‚Äô‚Äù 
And here we are, immersed in a no-name global war that has no logical end and few serious critics in the world of mainstream media and politics. But maybe the American democracy is not the closed system it‚Äôs supposed to be. 
For instance, John Feffer , director of Foreign Policy in Focus, points out that Donald Trump, in all his fun-house recklessness, is shaking up the consensus: ‚ÄúDemocrats and Republicans disagree about many things. But with a few exceptions they all support an enormous military budget, an expensive overseas expeditionary force, and unilateral acts of force when necessary to protect US national interests (understood broadly). 
‚ÄúIt‚Äôs an odd paradox that Trump, who blathers on about making America great again, departs from this consensus.‚Äù 
He won‚Äôt win, and he shouldn‚Äôt win for a million reasons, but in his recklessness he has touched the raw anger of a sizable chunk of the American electorate. Sanders, speaking with compassion and integrity and delivering a far different message, managed to tap the same well of public outrage. And, as Feffer noted, ‚Äúthe mainstream is worried that the political parties will realize that the ‚Äòbring the war dollars home‚Äô message can win a national election and disrupt the comfortable revolving-door consensus.‚Äù 
And World War II will finally end? Not this year, but maybe four years from now, if we refuse to let the war consensus have any peace in the interim.

"As Darkness Falls, A Silver Lining","As Darkness Falls, A Silver Lining Short term pessimism ‚Äì long term optimism Share This 
The future, in many respects, looks dark for opponents of interventionism and the National Security State. US troops are currently involved in civil wars and ‚Äúpolicing‚Äù across a wide swath of the Middle East, Europe, and Eastasia. Our political class is firmly committed to a globalist ideology that disdains the very concept of national sovereignty, most especially our own. And what Dwight Eisenhower called the ‚Äú military-industrial-congressional complex ‚Äù is more firmly entrenched than ever, extracting billions from the ‚Äúpublic‚Äù purse and filling their coffers at our expense. 
Furthermore, the presidential election is hardly encouraging. The prospect of Hillary Clinton in the White House must surely cause even the most optimistic among us to consider building one of those backyard bomb shelters so popular during the cold war era and stocking it with a couple of years supply of emergency rations. She has all but threatened to go to war with nuclear-armed Russia , intervene massively in Syria , and ratchet up NATO‚Äôs encirclement of the Russian bear. 
Yet these are all short-term concerns: in the long term, we anti-interventionists have every reason to be optimistic. 
To begin with, the American people are with us. Every poll shows that, while support for a strong defense is rising, the reluctance to engage in foreign wars is strong and getting stronger. The most recent measuring of anti-interventionist sentiment came out just as I started writing this column: a mere 25 percent want the US to expand the role of the US military overseas, reports the Financial Times . Fourteen percent say the fifteen years of constant warfare have made us more safe, 51 percent disagree. A majority says no to ‚Äúsafe zones‚Äù or any sort of intervention in Syria: and a whopping 80 percent say Congress must approve any military action abroad. 
Secondly, the victory of Donald Trump in the Republican presidential primary has broken the iron grip of the neoconservatives on GOP foreign policy orthodoxy and given opposition to globalism new legitimacy in the pubic square. No matter what one may think of Trump as a candidate, and in spite of his many inconsistencies, one indisputable fact remains: the Republican party, which cheered as George W. Bush launched two wars and declared a multi-generational interventionist project, very shortly afterward nominated someone who not only opposed the Iraq war but said ‚ÄúThey lied. There were no weapons of mass destruction and they knew there were none .‚Äù That, all by itself, represents a sea change. But it didn‚Äôt end there. 
Trump has questioned the utility of NATO, and even threatened to pull out if member states didn‚Äôt pay their fair share ‚Äì a pronouncement that, just a short time ago, would have been inconceivable coming from any major part presidential nominee. He wondered aloud why we‚Äôre defending South Korea, Japan, and Saudi Arabia , all rich nations that are perfectly capable of defending themselves. And he provoked the undying ire of the War Party when he asked : ‚ÄúWouldn‚Äôt it be nice if we could get along with Russia?‚Äù 
Underscoring that he understands the broader implications of these positions, Trump adopted a campaign theme that evokes the historical legacy of the anti-interventionist movement in this country: ‚ÄúAmerica First.‚Äù This provoked paroxysms of hatred from the foreign policy mandarins in Washington, who loathe ‚Äúisolationism‚Äù ‚Äî and their squeals of outrage were music to my ears. 
Thirdly, the Trump campaign has generated the healthiest trend to be seen in this country in a long time: widespread skepticism, and even hatred, of the ‚Äúmainstream‚Äù media. Trump has campaigned against the media almost more than he has against Hillary Clinton, making them a special target of his disdain. ‚ÄúSee those people out there,‚Äù he says at his rallies, pointing to the media in attendance. ‚ÄúThey‚Äôre the worst! They‚Äôre corrupt!‚Äù And as a chorus of jeers rises up from the crowd, we can count another victory for our side. 
For the very same media that served as a conduit for the war propaganda of the Bush administration is now going after Trump, hammer and tongs , in an unabashed campaign to deny him the presidency. The result is that nearly half the country is now not only skeptical of anything they hear coming from the media, they positively loathe them ‚Äì and that, from our perspective, is a Good Thing. 
Remember, it was the American media that assured us Saddam Hussein was plotting to nuke Washington, D.C., and reported the Bush administration‚Äôs talking points as if they were fact. The same newspaper that put Judy Miller‚Äôs manufactured ‚Äúrevelations‚Äù about Iraq‚Äôs alleged nuclear program on the front page is now in the vanguard of the anti-Trump jihad. The Washington Post , which has editorially supported every single military intervention in the past 35 years, today reads like a publication of the Democratic National Committee. 
The revelation that the media, rather than being a watchdog of Power, is itself an integral part of the power structure, is one of the great contributions of the Trump campaign. In the past, journalists, hiding behind the pretense of ‚Äúobjectivity,‚Äù have effectively channeled the War Party‚Äôs propaganda, reporting it as fact: now that this pretense has been dropped, and their brazen partisanship has been exposed, much of their power to persuade has been lost. 
The media and the Establishment they serve are telling us that all this will go away after the election. Having already declared Mrs. Clinton the winner, they‚Äôre gloating that Trumpism ‚Äì and the Trump Effect ‚Äì is dead or dying. 
This is wishful thinking on their part. The reality is that there‚Äôs an undercurrent coursing through Flyover America that threatens the ideological and political hegemony of the War Party, and, indeed, poses a rising challenge to our arrogant and self-isolated political class. Trump has tapped into this, and he will not be the last to do so. The movement to put ‚ÄúAmerica First,‚Äù to reject the blandishments of Empire and restore our Old Republic, far from being dead, is just being born. 
Yes, dark clouds are gathering on the horizon: but if you step back, the silver lining shines through.

If he loses the election by a significant margin, won‚Äôt many of the entirely legitimate issues and questions Trump has raised be submerged again by his defeat? And doesn‚Äôt the mere fact that it is Trump who has raised these issues and questions de-legitimize them in the eyes of those who (with the assistance of anti-Trump ads and Big Media reportage) can see only Trump‚Äôs character flaws? TonyDiGerolamo 
Was thinking the same thing. However, if the media so brazenly lies, why not the pollsters? Maybe Trump isn‚Äôt losing by much or not at all. Maybe the powers that be want it to look like Trump is losing so that stealing the election won‚Äôt be questioned. Eileen Kuch 
The truth is, Tony, this election‚Äôs already being rigged. Many voters in Texas alone who‚Äôve voted early have complained about their votes being switched from Republican to Democrat. This vote switch has already proved Trump to be right about the election being rigged. The Donald already has a lawsuit in place, should he lose this election. This lawsuit contains a complaint that voters in GOP districts had been intimidated by violent groups such as Black Lives Matter (BLM) and Marxist activists and threatened with violence if they (the voters) voted for Trump. It is a felony to intimidate and threaten violence against voters in an election. Period. Those participating in this tactic must be immediately arrested and charged accordingly.

And yet, despite the ubiquity of smart phones, not a single one has shown it actually happening. Strider73 
Do you really think the people in charge of the machines would allow anyone to get out his/her phone and take such a photo or video? Nor would they allow someone else to do so on another voter‚Äôs behalf. Thane_Eichenauer 
Personally I believe the touch screen calibration explanation by and large. Half the reports I also attribute to user error. If you can‚Äôt use a touch screen you probably aren‚Äôt capable of capturing the error on a smart phone. Those people that are adept with computers, touch screens and smart phones won‚Äôt have the problem in the first place. I would think there would still be a captured report but Strider73 below does make a good point. wars r u.s. Thomas L. Knapp 
Interesting point. 
I think it‚Äôs worth comparing Trump to Ron Paul on that. Paul was right on foreign policy, right on trade, and at least not as egregiously wrong and anti-American as Trump on immigration. And while he did energize a movement, he pretty much got nowhere in the GOP presidential nomination race. 
Trump sometimes gets something right on foreign policy, usually five minutes or so before reversing himself. He doesn‚Äôt reverse himself on his egregiously wrong and anti-American positions on trade and immigration. 
So I guess the lesson is, if you want to be the Republican presidential nominee, be as wrong as it‚Äôs humanly possible to be on most issues all of the time, and on the rest of the issues some of the time. 
I‚Äôm guessing that the occasional sense he talks on foreign policy will be, as you put it, once again submerged if he loses the election. Skywalker 
Trump‚Äôs candidacy is more like Barry Goldwater‚Äôs than Ron Paul‚Äôs. Unlike Paul,Trump got the nomination and like Goldwater he redefined the parameters of national debate. Goldwater‚Äôs defeat emboldened conservatives to lose national elections on their principles for 16 years until Reagan was elected. Trump questioned some of the underpinnings of the Neocons. Unfortunately he was as pro-Zionist as any other candidate, including Clinton and as militaristic as the Neocons. Trump just saw the existential enemies of the US as ISIS and China, not Russia. Instead Trump wanted to push the allies and Russia to the front lines against ISIS and China with the US backing them up. But Trump‚Äôs enduring popularity and the independence of the Sanders supporters showed that the Neocons and the MSM are losing control of public opinion and the national discourse. All the polls show that Trump will do much better than Goldwater. So we may be closer to a real antiwar candidate than the MSM would like us to believe. Finally, it is too early to count Trump out. Florida, Ohio and North Carolina are still close and a timely WikiLeaks dump could still swing those states and the election. 
‚ÄúFinally, it is too early to count Trump out. Florida, Ohio and North Carolina are still close and a timely WikiLeaks dump could still swing those states and the election.‚Äù 
Unless something changes, I still expect Trump to win. 
A lot of people are mistakenly looking at this as a national election. It isn‚Äôt. It‚Äôs 50 state elections (plus DC and the territories, although if I recall correctly the territories get no electoral votes and so don‚Äôt really matter except as preference polls). 
If Clinton wins California 55-45, she gets exactly the same number of electoral votes as if she wins it 70-30. If she loses Texas 51-49, she is no closer to its electoral votes than if she loses it 80-20. So when she gains in national polls, it‚Äôs important to realize that WHERE those gains are coming from matters. 
It‚Äôs also quite likely that many Trump voters aren‚Äôt admitting they are Trump voters, even on the phone to pollsters. There‚Äôs a stigma in some areas. 
I expect Trump to win any state that the polls have him within five points of carrying. And I expect him to win the election. disqus_eEbPU3IGDU 
My guess is Trump wins in a squeaker, but the Democrats steal the election and Hillary becomes president. Eileen Kuch 
I expect Trump to win in a near landslide. Well over 70% of eligible voters have already said they‚Äôd never vote for Hillary Clinton, and a good number are millennials who had supported Bernie Sanders during the primaries and who are now furious over Bernie‚Äôs betrayal of them at the end, but still blame Hillary. In these young people‚Äôs minds, Trump is the next best choice as POTUS. They know how corrupt the Hildabeast truly is, how desperate she is to gain the Oval Office ‚Äì even by rigging the election in her favor. After all, she had done it to Bernie in the primaries. However, Trump has more determination at winning the Oval Office than had Bernie. He also had stronger opposition. richard vajs 
If Hillary does win (and we can count on Bill pulling every dirty trick out of his evil mind to ensure that), one thing that we can count on ‚Äì 4 years of legislation to prevent any Populist like Bernie or Trump from ever getting another foothold on the Ladder of Power in this country. The elite don‚Äôt ever want to have to worry about the ‚Äúlittle people‚Äù getting uppity again. Remember, This is Their Country. wars r u.s. comrade hermit 
Ron Paul, like him or loath him, was/is a legitimate pacifist. Trump is a knuckle-dragging malignant narcissist who would drone strike a fourth grade slumber party for prank phone-calling him. BIG f**king difference there. I don‚Äôt believe the good Doctor Paul has earned such a slur. His son maybe but leave the old man out of this one. Just sayin. supremeborg 
‚ÄúRon Paul, like him or loath him, was/is a legitimate pacifist‚Äù 
Just a slight correction to your terminology. Ron Paul is not, technically, a pacifist, in spite of the fact that he would have opposed every war the US has been in save the original war of Revolution. He upholds the legitimacy of violence used in self defense, at least some of the time, in some cases 
Your point is well taken, however, as he is the most consistent anti-interventionist to have served in Congress in my lifetime. 
There are different interpretations of pacifism. Many people, including myself, consider themselves to be pacifists but still defend the right to self defense. Joe Flack 
And Big Media has at least three years to work with. By the next presidential election cycle, Trump and his message will very likely be all but forgotten. John V. Walsh 
Good column. A correction. Justin writes, ‚ÄúThe same newspaper that put Judy Miller‚Äôs manufactured ‚Äúrevelations‚Äù about Iraq‚Äôs alleged nuclear program on the front page is now in the vanguard of the anti-Trump jihad. It was not only Judith Miller that authored the article but she and co-author Michael R. Gordon who has remained the ‚ÄúChief Military Correspondent‚Äù of the NYT. The despicable Miller took the hit when the lies of the article could no longer be denied but the despicable Gordon continued on. And the article was obviously a pile of assertions without evidence save for hearsay. That was obvious to me and I have not served as an editor since my high school newspaper. The editors who passed on that piece of shit should also be sent to some gulag, their existence there to be supervised by parents and children of Iraqis and Americans who lost their lives in the War on Iraq. Strider73

Nah, just hang them (or if one is more frugal, give them one bullet to the head each like the Chinese do) for crimes against humanity. Julius Streicher was executed at N√ºrnberg simply for publishing a virulently anti-Jewish tabloid ; under that standard they deserve the same. Mikhailovich 
By independent mass media they mean mass media independent from the state. This idea promoted by those few mass media corporations who own the mass media and together with other corporations they own the state. Very few people own almost everything. You can‚Äôt change situation by attacking the correspondents and editors, they are employed people. Here I shut up, one can‚Äôt touch the Sacred Golden Bull, the worshippers would be insulted.

Somehow, in the US, ‚ÄòAmerica First‚Äô is interpreted as being a racist and misogynistic proclamation. richard vajs 
I can just see a smiling Bill Clinton leaning back and saying, ‚Äúlook, here is how we win this thing, Hil. ‚Äì Divide and Conquer ‚Äì millions of women are anxious to battle ‚Äúabuse and prejudice against women and teach an abuser a lesson!‚Äù. Not very original, but effective- was effective in the ‚ÄúChange , you can believe in‚Äù ad campaign eight years ago. Four years from now, the same women will still have lousy or no jobs; money will still be being spent in the Mid East bombing Muslims for Israel; the Clintons and their friends will be building bigger mansions, and a new generation of Americans will be ready for another round of shearing. Luther Blissett 
I enjoy the optimism of this column but I‚Äôm witnessing the opposite ‚Äì many worthy anti-globalist & anti-war ideas are being tarred and deeply poisoned by having such a truly unlikable and wildly unstable politician claim them as his own. Making the case against toppling Assad was easier before Trump started blabbering on about Assad & Putin ‚Äòoutsmarting‚Äô America. 
Trump has tapped into real populist frustration, especially in the working class & the underemployed youth, but he is simply far too incoherent and repellent to do anything with it besides waste it on his own vanity. 
Right-wing hatred of the ‚Äòliberal media‚Äô has been at a scalding boil since the Vietnam war so I don‚Äôt think Trump should get any credit for that ‚Äì but it would be nice that when the next big terrorist attack in the ‚Äòhomeland‚Äô occurs if the Red States were skeptical because if Hillary is president the Blue States are going shove the American flag down everyone‚Äôs throat and floss them with it. 
Those so called ‚Äúpolls‚Äù are made in secret, right? Why would you trust that? bob balkas 
Compare ‚Äúour political class committed to globalist ideology‚Äù with my: Our master class along with a sub-master class on the road to obtain the entire planet and permanent rule of the world master class of all subclasses or ‚Äòlower-valued‚Äô bipeds. 
Curioso is also the term, ‚Äúwe the anti-interventionists‚Äù. The term means that US intervenes when something goes wrong in other countries. But the naked facts say otherwise. US not only commits crimes against some nations, but before it does those crimes, it almost always first destabilizes them in too many ways to list them all. After all, many nations and people believe that CIA is the biggest terrorist organization. 
The Nation Gang; aka Nato no longer utile, according to Trump? Even if Trump wins, someone would explain to him that such a gang will be very useful to world gangsterism and supremacy of the master class. disqus_eEbPU3IGDU 
Very very very well put. Justin might have added that for a long time the MSM in the so-called Free World were even worse that the government-controlled media in Communist countries and dictatorships. In the Free World, the MSM have not been under formal government control, so this makes them seem objective so that what they say is more believable and their power is greater. If in fact they do sometimes print something that Washington really doesn‚Äôt like, that‚Äôs just good psychology because it reinforces the impression that MSM really are independent watchdogs of government. By contrast, in the Communist countries and dictatorships, the media have been under formal government ownership. As this fact could not of course have been hidden from the people, the latter naturally tended to discount what they read in the media because they knew that the media were biased. Claus-Erik Hamle 
Trump may win. In Colombia there was no doubt that it would be ‚Äúyes‚Äù, but unfortunately, it ended ‚Äúno‚Äù. So really, it¬¥s impossible to know. Does she really mean that she¬¥ll nake a no-fly zone no matter that it leads to war with Syria and Russia? disqus_eEbPU3IGDU 
This is a crazy election, the craziest since at least 1968. In such a crazy and unusual situation, what do the polls mean? YouAreNuts 
The only silver lining I‚Äôve seen this week is the acquittal of the Bundy Ranch protesters. Hopefully the Finnicum family make a mint (of taxpayer money) in a lawsuit for the unnecessary shooting of Lavoy. 
Elsewhere, I have to agree with Assange; Trump probably can‚Äôt overcome the almost complete propaganda and intimidation blitz against his campaign by the MSM and hackjob Democrat browbeaters and Jackboot thugs. 
Once Hillary is in, it won‚Äôt so much be her forcing policy down her throat; it will be the entire Dem machine and presstitute corp as mentioned above‚Ä¶ Assange, btw, will probably get renditioned or taken out.. 
Since it‚Äôs logistically difficult to impossible for millions to stream into DC to squat and demand justice, I don‚Äôt really see any threat of consequences for whatever atrocious policies that the sadists in Washington implement. Eileen Kuch 
Regarding Hillary‚Äôs so-called ‚Äúvictory‚Äù, I have to disagree. With every revelation of her crimes by Wikileaks, the Hildabeast‚Äôs chances of winning the election grow slimmer and slimmer, as her poll ratings take hit after hit after hit. The DNC‚ÄôS and the Hillary Campaign‚Äôs involvement in violence against Trump supporters doesn‚Äôt help her campaign, either .. Instead, such intimidation only backfires on the DNC and the Hillary Campaign. It has boosted Trump‚Äôs chances of winning the election. There‚Äôs still one more ‚Äúsurprise‚Äù from Wikileaks yet to be released, and what it contains may destroy Hillary‚Äôs chances. Aion The Irredeemable 
It almost seems as though Justin has accepted reality and is now supporting Donald Trump. Has he seen the light or is he now pandering to the huge numbers of his followers who have left the Libertarian camp to become true conservatives? I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôll be returning to the liberal/libertarian point of view but it‚Äôs a good sign that Justin has accepted the fact that Donald Trump represents the only force that will defeat the social marxists and their agenda of the New World Order/Globalists.

Trump is not the cause of these growing trends. He is a symptom of them and not exactly a positive one. When empires are in decline, the aggrieved masses often look to authority figures to save them from the inevitable death of a way of life. In this country we call that dying way of life the ‚ÄúAmerican Dream‚Äù. A dream of stability and upward mobility that has been in decline for decades but is now in free fall. The Donald cannot save this dream. No one can. It is built upon the lie of state capitalism which is inherently unsustainable and built to self-destruct. Our only hope for real change is a total shift in the way we approach the very notion of modern society. This change cannot come from above, from an authoritarian savior figure. It must come from bellow, from the streets, and it must be divorced from the outdated left-right paradigm. Anti-statists and anti-imperialists of all stripes must join together in solidarity and bring this beast called empire to its knees where it belongs. Strider73

US Airstrike Kills Four Iraqi Troops Near Mosul,"Nine Others Wounded in 'Friendly Fire' Attack by Jason Ditz, October 29, 2016 Share This 
As Iraqi forces continue to struggle to get closer to the ISIS city of Mosul during the ongoing invasion, a US friendly fire incident has been reported in the town of Tal-Kayf, a town which fell quite some time ago and in which recent fighting hadn‚Äôt been reported. 
According to Iraqi military officials, the US airstrikes against the town killed at least four Iraqi soldiers and wounded nine others . The details are still scant on what happened, and the US has yet to comment on the incident at all. 
Iraqi officials are chalking it up as a mistake, but it is unclear why the town would be struck by US planes in the first place, as the Iraqi troops had been there for almost a week and there did not appear to be ISIS forces in the immediate vicinity. 
Iraqi forces confirmed the incident amid an announcement of more villages captured in the area west of Mosul. Many of the villages more than 5 km from the city have already fallen, and ISIS appears to be only sparsely defending those that remain, with the vast majority of their fighters hunkered down in Mosul itself, prepared for a major battle.

Two Points About the Hillary Clinton Email Fiasco,"Much is being made of Hillary Clinton‚Äôs private email server, which she used when she was Secretary of State. To me, the real issue is not that Hillary endangered national security by sending classified information in the clear. No ‚Äì the real issue is that the Clintons act as if they are above the rules and laws that apply to ‚Äúthe little people.‚Äù They are superior and smug, totally devoted to themselves and their pursuit of power and the privileges that come with it. It‚Äôs a matter of character, in other words. Hillary‚Äôs evasiveness, her lack of transparency, her self-righteousness, her strong sense of her own rectitude, make her a dangerous candidate for the presidency.
My second point is this: The issue of classification should be turned on its head. The real issue is not that Hillary potentially revealed secrets. No ‚Äì the real issue is that our government keeps far too much from us. Our government uses security classification not so much to keep us safe, but to keep the national security state safe ‚Äì safe from the eyes of the American people.

As The Guardian reported in 2013 :
‚ÄúA committee established by Congress, the Public Interest Declassification Board, warned in December that rampant over-classification is ‚Äòimped[ing] informed government decisions and an informed public‚Äô and, worse, ‚Äòenabl[ing] corruption and malfeasance‚Äô. In one instance it documented, a government agency was found to be classifying one petabyte of new data every 18 months, the equivalent of 20m filing cabinets filled with text.‚Äù
Nowadays, seemingly everything is classified. And if it‚Äôs classified, if it‚Äôs secret, we can‚Äôt know about it. Because we can‚Äôt be trusted with it. That‚Äôs a fine idea for an autocracy or dictatorship, but not so fine for a democracy.
Government of the people, by the people, for the people? Impossible when nearly everything of any importance is classified.
Too bad Hillary didn‚Äôt send everything in the clear ‚Äì what a service she would have done for the American people and for democracy!

200 Killed in Iraq; Shi‚Äôite Militias Join Mosul Campaign,"Share This Shi‚Äôite militiamen announced they have launched their campaign to reach Tal Afar and cut off an escape route to Syria that is being used both by Islamic State militants and refugees. Still eager to insinuate Turkish troops into the Mosul campaign, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdoƒüan announced he would reinforce Turkish forces in the border town of Silopi. There, they will be ready to be deployed should he believe that Shi‚Äôite militiamen are causing sectarian terror in Tal Afar , home to many Turkmen. In Mosul , witnesses say that thousands of human shields rounded up in the outskirts of the city are now clustered in central Mosul and are without food or shelter. Many of the displaced are women, children, or elderly and appear to be in poor condition after their forced marches. In other parts of the city, militants are rounding up former security personnel. Security forces say the town of Shura has been cleared of militants after a battle. A humanitarian corridor has been set up for civilians to relocate to nearby Qayara. The villages of Abu Arayis, Ayn An Nasr, Humaidiya, Jayif, Majman, Mukhalat, Mustanqa, Shruq, Tal Tayiba, and Zwirij were also liberated . Hamza, Haram, Mwaylaha,, Sajma, and San Zaban were freed as well. Several of these villages were captured by Shi‚Äôite militia forces. At least 200 people were killed and 94 were wounded , including 10 P.K.K. guerrillas: The number of casualties in the Kirkuk assault that occurred just over a week ago was readjusted from previous estimates . The number of civilian and security personnel casualties rose by 17 dead and 65 wounded .",1
"Saudi Warplanes Repeatedly Bomb Yemen Prison, Killing 60","Officials Say Attack In Keeping With Targeting Procedures   
Mostly destroyed and no longer usable, the prison in the Yemeni city of Hodeidah held 84 inmates until Saturday, when Saudi Arabian warplanes repeatedly bombed it, killing at least 60 of the people within and wounding dozens of others. 
The exact number of prisoners killed compared to guards is unknown, though prisoners are said to be the vast majority. The prison was leveled in the attack, according to witnesses, and rescue workers are still looking through the rubble, with others believed trapped within. 
Three airstrikes were targeted against the prison, with the first hitting it directly, bringing down the roof, and the follow-up attacks targeting the gates and the administration buildings. The Saudi coalition insisted the attacks were in keeping with targeting procedures, noting the prison was known to have Houthi security forces within. 
It is unclear who the prisoners generally were at the prison, but deliberately attacking a prison will doubtless add to concerns about Saudi Arabia‚Äôs standards for airstrikes against Yemen, which have killed massive numbers of civilians over the past 19 months.  ",1
US Inspector General: Afghan Govt Rapidly Lost Territory Over Summer,"Pentagon Downplays Situation as Losses Mount   
The Pentagon‚Äôs narrative on the Afghan War tries to present the territory changes as brief, minor, and limited, repeatedly touting the fact that the Afghan government still controls the majority of the country. It‚Äôs a shrinking majority, however, as a new report from the Special Inspector General for Afghanistan Reconstruction (SIGAR) notes. 
SIGAR noted that the data from the Pentagon showed that the Afghan government actually controlled only about 63.4 percent of the country as of the end of August, the result of steady losses throughout the summer. All indications are that the losses have continued over the past two months as well. 
If these numbers sound worse than those coming from the Pentagon, it‚Äôs because they are. Officially, the Pentagon‚Äôs percentages are based on ‚Äúcontrol or influence‚Äù of population, not physical territory held. These numbers tend to be higher, because most of the major cities are still controlled by the government, even if many are surrounded. 
Pentagon officials have done this not only to have bigger percentages, but to downplay the losses, arguing that they are mostly in rural areas. While this is true, the reality is that Afghanistan is a heavily rural country, and strongly dependent on farming. The Taliban has aimed in many cases specifically at the farmlands, particularly in opium-producing regions, because those are so much more economically valuable for them. 
The SIGAR report also cited major casualties among Afghan security forces as a matter of concern. Again, this was in stark contrast to Pentagon statements, which have insisted that morale among the still surviving troops remains strong  ",1
Chances of Yemen Partition Grow as Pro-Saudi Faction Spurns UN Peace Deal,"Hadi: UN Deal Would Reward 'Putschists' by Jason Ditz, October 30, 2016 Share This 
The UN offered a glimmer of hope for a peace process 19 months in Yemen‚Äôs war last week, offering a peace deal which would see the installation of an interim government made of mostly technocrats, and in which former President Hadi would be a figurehead. 
Hadi, on whose behalf Saudi invaded Yemen, was quick to spurn the deal, insisting it would ‚Äú reward the putschist s‚Äù and punish his legitimate government. Hadi was ‚Äúelected‚Äù to a two-year term in office in early 2012, and resigned in 2015, but insists he remains the rightful ruler of the nation. 
The Shi‚Äôite Houthis, who had previously ruled out any deal in which Hadi was returned to power, expressed support for the UN plan as a ‚Äú basis for discussion .‚Äù The deal would force Hadi‚Äôs main deputy to resign, and give Hadi little to no real power. 
Hadi‚Äôs rejection, assuming it is upheld by his Saudi backers, means a continuation of the war, and greatly increases the likelihood that Yemen as a unified nation is over. The nation is already in a state of de facto split, and roughly on the same borders as before the 1990 unification. 
This may ultimately make more sense for Yemen at any rate, resolving long-standing secessionist ambitions in the south, and leaving Hadi with control of South Yemen, where he is from, and where his limited political support is centered. 
The Saudis are unlikely to accept such a solution, however, as it would leave a North Yemen dominated by the Houthis and former president Ali Abdullah Saleh‚Äôs political allies with a substantial border with Saudi Arabia after a bloody Saudi-instigated war against them. 
While a unity deal in which Hadi gets only token power would allow the Saudis to claim some measure of ‚Äúvictory‚Äù in their war, a formal separation would be much harder to spin, and would leave them with a very resentful neighbor on their southern border. Last 5 posts by Jason Ditz",1
27 Civilians Killed in Saudi Airstrikes Against Yemen Villages,"Attacks Destroyed Villagers' Homes, Burned Farms by Jason Ditz, October 30, 2016 Share This 
While the biggest single Saudi airstrike over the weekend in Yemen targeted a prison in Hodeidah, dozens of other strikes were reported over the weekend by villagers around Taiz and in the Maarib Province, with attacks killing at least 27 civilians , and wounding a number of others. 
Most of the casualties were in Taiz, where attacks destroyed several homes and caused a large number of injuries. With hospitals in the area having very limited access to medicine because of the naval blockade, many of those injuries proved fatal. 
The attacks in Maarib and Saada, however, may prove more devastating to the country in the long run, targeting some of the very limited farmland Yemen has, destroying a number of villagers‚Äô homes and burning a lot of that farmland. Yemen has to import some 90 percent of its food under normal circumstances, with such imports severely limited by the blockade, and the loss of farmland just adds to food insecurity in the nation. 
Saudi Arabia has been coming under growing international criticism for its air war against Yemen, with massive numbers of civilians killed and little sign that the promised improvements to targeting will ever amount to anything. Last 5 posts by Jason Ditz",1
UN Slams Aleppo Rebels Amid Accused Poison Gas Attacks,"Rebels Continue Offensive Against Western Aleppo by Jason Ditz, October 30, 2016 Share This 
A coalition of rebels including al-Qaeda‚Äôs-Nusra Front and the Free Syrian Army are continuing their offensive against the government-held western half of Aleppo . The UN harshly criticized them for their use of ‚Äú indiscriminate ‚Äù weapons, warning it could amount to war crimes. 
Perhaps the biggest issue, though as-yet-unproven, is reports that the rebels have begun to use chlorine-filled shells in their attacks. Syrian media reported 35 civilians were suffering from effects of the toxic gas, though the rebels denied using them. 
The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights reported at least 21 people killed over the weekend, amid heavy fighting around western Aleppo. The offensive began Friday, with the Nusra-led rebels trying to end a siege of their eastern half of the city. 
This has been a recurring situation in Aleppo since it boiled down to just the military and this rebel faction, with both sides having repeatedly launched offensives and counter-offensives over the last several months, trading sieges and strikes against one anothers‚Äô neighborhoods. 
This has resulted in heavy casualties for the civilians stuck in the city, facing regular sieges that they are rarely as able to survive as the combatants, and taking the brunt of the rockets, airstrikes, and artillery attacks. The addition of chemical weapons, even primitive ones, threaten to make the matter far worse. Last 5 posts by Jason Ditz",1
"Shi‚Äôite Militias Enter Mosul Battle, But Eyes Are on Joining Syria War","Deployment Meant to Block ISIS Escape by Jason Ditz, October 30, 2016 Share This 
As the Iraqi invasion of Mosul continues, the Shi‚Äôite militia groups who have proven so controversial in previous attacks have begun to deploy west of the city, aiming to block the escape of any ISIS forces into Syria. The militias see this as the last real fight against ISIS inside Iraq, and are openly talking about heading into Syria next . 
While the militias‚Äô involvement in previous captures of major Sunni Arab cities around Iraq has seen them looting, torturing, and killing with reckless abandon, the militias‚Äô ambition to get into Syria once this is wrapped up may mean less are left behind around Mosul to harass the locals. 
The sectarian nature of the wars in Iraq and Syria have both led to a spike in recruitment for the Shi‚Äôite militias, with many being deployed around significant religious sites in both countries to protect them from groups like ISIS. For many of them, this has also meant a blurring of the lines between the two wars. 
There remains considerable concern about the impact on the Mosul population of the militias‚Äô presence. This is doubly true because, in ‚Äúblocking‚Äù ISIS escape, they may also end up blocking the escape of the civilian population,. which is unlikely to be welcomed if they flee into Kurdish territory. 
That‚Äôs also a recurring reality in Iraq‚Äôs war, that the Sunni Arab civilians aren‚Äôt welcomed into Kurdish or Shi‚Äôite territory, and generally end up having to flee into other ISIS territory for lack of alternatives. With little ISIS territory left, it is unclear where they‚Äôll go. Last 5 posts by Jason Ditz",1
Syrian Observatory: 300 ISIS Child Soldiers Killed in Past Two Weeks Around Mosul,"Share This 
According to the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, around 300 Syrian children, recruited as child soldiers by ISIS, have been killed over the past two weeks in fighting in and around the Iraqi city of Mosul. The brigade is called the ‚Äúcubs of the caliphate.‚Äù 
Locals reported that the loss of children in fighting around the Syrian town of Daquq was spun by ISIS religious leaders as minor compared to the gains they would secure in Mosul. The fighting is fierce around Mosul, and the casualties are high. 
The Observatory said that at least 480 Syrian fighters had been killed in fighting around the Mosul area since the fighting began two weeks ago. This means that a strong majority of those casualties were actually children. 
The US has claimed they believe between 800 and 900 fighters have been killed overall around Mosul. This indicates that the fighting outside of Mosul is heavily between invading Iraqi forces and ISIS‚Äô Syrian auxiliaries. Large numbers of ISIS fighters are believed to have remained within Mosul, preparing to defend the city itself.  ",1
Iraqi Militia Leader: Mosul Battle Won‚Äôt Be a Picnic,"Insists Badr Brigade Prepared Even if Battle Lasts Months by Jason Ditz, October 30, 2016 Share This 
A powerful MP as well as the head of the Badr Brigade, the largest militia within Iraq‚Äôs ‚ÄúPopulation Mobilization Forces,‚Äù Hadi al-Amiri expressed caution about expectations of a quick invasion of the city of Mosul, which is ISIS‚Äô largest city. 
‚ÄúThe battle of Mosul will not be a picnic. It needs time, it needs precision, it needs a deep breath,‚Äù Amiri insisted, adding that his Badr Brigade is prepared to continue with the battle even if it lasts for several months. And well it might. 
Though US officials initially presented the battle as having a timetable of weeks, Kurdish officials responded with predictions it would last multiple months. Indeed, nearly two weeks into the attack, the invading forces are still several kilometers from Mosul, and not expected to enter the city for some time. 
Some of the militia forces involved in the fighting over Mosul are openly talking about their intention to join the Syrian war as soon as Mosul is finished, suggesting they may be looking beyond what is expected to be by far the largest battle of the war.  ",1
Putin-Obama Trust Evaporates,"Share This 
How did the ""growing trust"" that Russian President Vladimir Putin once said marked his ""working and personal relationship with President Obama "" change into today‚Äôs deep distrust and saber-rattling? 
Their relationship reached its zenith after Mr. Putin persuaded Syria to give up its chemical weapons for verified destruction, enabling Mr. Obama at the last minute to call off, with some grace, plans to attack Syria in late summer 2013. But at an international conference in the Russian Black Sea resort of Sochi last week, Mr. Putin spoke of the ""feverish"" state of international relations and lamented: ""My personal agreements with the President of the United States have not produced results."" He complained about ""people in Washington ready to do everything possible to prevent these agreements from being implemented in practice"" and, referring to Syria, decried the lack of a ""common front against terrorism after such lengthy negotiations, enormous effort, and difficult compromises."" 
A month earlier, Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov , who chooses his words carefully, told Russian TV viewers, ""My good friend John Kerry ‚Ä¶ is under fierce criticism from the U.S. military machine. Despite [Mr. Kerry‚Äôs] assurances that the US commander in chief, President Barack Obama, supported him in his contacts with Russia (he confirmed that during his meeting with President Vladimir Putin) apparently the military does not really listen to the commander in chief."" 
Do not chalk this up to paranoia. The U.S.-led coalition air strikes on known Syrian army positions killing scores of troops just five days into the September cease-fire ‚Äì not to mention statements at the time by the most senior US generals ‚Äì were evidence enough to convince the Russians that the Pentagon was intent on scuttling meaningful cooperation with Russia. 
Relations between the US and Russian presidents have now reached a nadir, and Mr. Putin has ordered his own defense ministry to throw down the gauntlet. On Oct. 6, ministry spokesman Maj. Gen. Igor Konashenkov said Russia is prepared to shoot down unidentified aircraft ‚Äì including any stealth aircraft ‚Äì over Syria, and warned ominously that Russian air defense will not have time to identify the origin of the aircraft. 
It seems possible that the US air force will challenge that claim in due course ‚Äì perhaps even without seeking prior permission from the White House. Last week, National Intelligence Director and former Air Force General James Clapper commented offhandedly, ""I wouldn‚Äôt put it past them to shoot down an American aircraft ‚Ä¶ if they felt it was threatening their forces on the ground."" 
Injecting additional volatility into the equation, major news outlets are playing down or ignoring Russia‚Äôs warnings. Thus, Americans who depend on the corporate media can be expected to be suitably shocked by what that same media will no doubt cast as naked aggression out of the blue if Russian air defenses down a US or coalition aircraft. 
Meanwhile in Europe, as NATO defense ministers met in Brussels on Wednesday, Defense Secretary Ashton Carter told reporters the US is contributing ""a persistent rotational armored brigade combat team"" as a ""major sign of the US commitment to strengthening deterrence here."" 
""This was a decision made by the alliance leaders in Warsaw,"" he explained, referring to NATO‚Äôs July summit meeting in the Polish capital. ""The United States will lead a battalion in Poland and deploy an entire battle-ready battalion task force of approximately 900 soldiers from the 2nd Cavalry Regiment, which is based in Germany."" 
On Thursday, at the Valdai Conference in the Russian Black Sea resort of Sochi, President Putin accused the West of promoting the ""myth"" of a ""Russian military threat,"" calling this a ""profitable business that can be used to pump new money into defense budgets ‚Ä¶ expand NATO and bring its infrastructure, military units, and arms closer to our borders."" 
Myth or not, German Foreign Minister Frank-Walter Steinmeier was correct to point out last spring that military posturing on Russia‚Äôs borders will bring less regional security. Mr. Steinmeier warned against ""saber-rattling,"" adding that, ""We are well advised not to create pretexts to renew an old confrontation."" 
Speaking of such pretexts, it is high time to acknowledge that the marked increase in East-West tensions over the past two and a half years originally stemmed from the Western-sponsored coup d‚Äô√©tat in Kiev on Feb. 22, 2014, and Russia‚Äôs reaction in annexing Crimea. Americans malnourished on the diet served up by ""mainstream"" media are blissfully unaware that two weeks before the coup, YouTube published a recording of an intercepted conversation between US Assistant Secretary of State Victoria Nuland and the US ambassador in Kiev, during which ""Yats"" (for Arseniy Yatsenyuk) was identified as Washington‚Äôs choice to become the new prime minister of the coup government in Kiev. 
This unique set of circumstances prompted George Friedman, president of the think-tank STRATFOR, to label the putsch in Kiev on Feb. 22, 2014, ""really the most blatant coup in history."" 
It‚Äôs time for Western politicians and media to learn their lesson and pay attention to the statements coming out of Russia. Ask yourselves: Why all this hype now? 
Ray McGovern, like Sam Adams, began a career as a CIA analyst under President Kennedy; working on Vietnam, they became close associates. Sam was too straight-arrow to go to the media about the unconscionable fraud regarding the number of Communist forces. Ray knew that and rationalized not doing so himself. So, while a close associate of Sam Adams years ago, Ray fell short of the standard set by the above awardees, who deserved to be honored by Sam Adams Associates for Integrity in Intelligence.

One Veteran‚Äôs War on Islamophobia,"One Veteran‚Äôs War on Islamophobia Nate Terani and Nick Turse, October 31, 2016 Share This 
Originally posted at TomDispatch . 
Recently, I was asked a question about Kill Anything That Moves , my history of civilian suffering during the Vietnam War. An interviewer wanted to know how I responded to veterans who took offense at the (supposed) implication that every American who served in Vietnam committed atrocities. 
I think I softly snorted and slowly shook my head. 
Already two books behind me, Kill Anything That Moves might as well have been written by someone else in another lifetime. In some sense, it was. 
It takes effort for me to dredge up the faded memories of that work, a Kodachrome-hued swirl of hundreds of interviews on two continents over the course of a decade. But this particular question was easy enough to answer. Almost all the Americans I interviewed had seen combat, but most American veterans of the war hadn‚Äôt. Many had little or no real opportunity to commit war crimes. Case closed. 
But that question caused me to recall a host of related queries that churned around the book. Questions by skeptics, atrocity-deniers, fair-minded interviewers attempting to play devil‚Äôs advocate. A favorite was whether the book was ""anti-veteran."" That, too, was a head-shaker for me. 
""How could that be?"" I would respond. After all, the book owed its genesis to veterans. Veterans were key sources for it. Veterans provided the evidence. Veterans provided the quotes. Veterans even supplied the title. The book was, to a great extent, the history of the war as described to me by veterans. The story I told was their story. How could that in any way be anti-veteran? 
Many of the vets I spoke with viewed their truth-telling as a form of patriotism, of continuing service to country. Nate Terani‚Äôs inaugural TomDispatch essay follows in the same American tradition. His eyes were opened to the abuse of military power while living in Iran as a boy. Later he would join the U.S. Navy and wear the stars and stripes with particular pride. September 11th and all that came after ‚Äì notably the demonization of his Muslim faith in his homeland ‚Äì imbued him with a new mission, one he now views as no less sacred than his military service. 
From Smedley Butler to Andrew Bacevich , Daniel Ellsberg to Chelsea Manning , Vietnam Veterans Against the War to Iraq Veterans Against the War , the U.S. armed forces have produced a steady stream of truth-tellers and whistleblowers, men and women willing to serve their country in profound ways during trying times. There‚Äôs no bronze star for activism, no Navy Cross for unpopular or contrarian opinions, no Purple Heart for the hard knocks involved in speaking out against war crimes or Islamophobia or laying bare information vital to the American public. Veterans who dare to do so have sometimes walked a cold, lonely road far from the warm glow enjoyed by summer soldiers and sunshine patriots. Those who do so exhibit a special form of courage that may even exceed the bravery of the battlefield, the courage to stand tall and make oneself a target, a courage deserving ( with a nod to Thomas Paine ) of the love and thanks of man and woman. ~ Nick Turse 
Tehran, USA Fighting Fundamentalism in America By Nate Terani 
I‚Äôm not an immigrant, but my grandparents are. More than 50 years ago, they arrived in New York City from Iran. I grew up mainly in central New Jersey, an American kid playing little league for the Raritan Red Sox and soccer for the Raritan Rovers. In 1985, I travelled with my family to our ancestral land. I was only eight, but old enough to understand that the Iranians had lost their liberty and freedom. I saw the abject despair of a people who, in a desperate attempt to bring about change, had ushered in nationalist tyrants led by Ayatollah Khomeini. 
What I witnessed during that year in Iran changed the course of my life. In 1996, at age 19, wanting to help preserve the blessings of liberty and freedom we enjoy in America, I enlisted in the U.S. Navy. Now, with the rise of Donald Trump and his nationalist alt-right movement, I‚Äôve come to feel that the values I sought to protect are in jeopardy. 
In Iran, theocratic fundmentalists sowed division and hatred of outsiders ‚Äì of Westerners, Christians, and other religious minorities. Here in America, the right wing seems to have stolen passages directly from their playbook as it spreads hatred of immigrants, particularly Muslim ones. This form of nationalistic bigotry ‚Äì Islamophobia ‚Äì threatens the heart of our nation. When I chose to serve in the military, I did so to protect what I viewed as our sacred foundational values of liberty, equality, and democracy. Now, 20 years later, I‚Äôve joined forces with fellow veterans to again fight for those sacred values, this time right here at home. 
""Death to America!"" 
As a child, I sat in my class at the international school one sunny morning and heard in the distance the faint sounds of gunfire and rising chants of ""Death to America!"" That day would define the rest of my life. 
It was Tehran, the capital of Iran, in 1985. I was attending a unique school for bilingual students who had been born in Western nations. It had become the last refuge in that city with any tolerance for Western teaching, but that also made it a target for military fundamentalists. As the gunfire drew closer, I heard boots pounding the marble tiles outside, marching into our building, and thundering down the corridor toward my classroom. As I heard voices chanting ""Death to America!"" I remember wondering if I would survive to see my parents again. 
In a flash of green and black uniforms, those soldiers rushed into our classroom, grabbed us by our shirt collars, and yelled at us to get outside. We were then packed into the school‚Äôs courtyard where a soldier pointed his rifle at our group and commanded us to look up. Almost in unison, my classmates and I raised our eyes and saw the flags of our many nations being torn down and dangled from the balcony, then set ablaze and tossed, still burning, into the courtyard. As those flags floated to the ground in flames, the soldiers fired their guns in the air. Shouting, they ordered us ‚Äì if we ever wanted to see our families again ‚Äì to swear allegiance to the Grand Ayatollah Khomeini and trample on the remains of the burning symbols of our home countries. I scanned the smoke that was filling the courtyard for my friends and classmates and, horrified, watched them capitulate and begin to chant, ""Death to America!"" as they stomped on our sacred symbols. 
I was so angry that, young as I was, I began to plead with them to come to their senses. No one paid the slightest attention to an eight year old and yet, for the first time in my life, I felt something like righteous indignation. I suspect that, born and raised in America, I was already imbued with such a sense of privilege that I just couldn‚Äôt fathom the immense danger I was in. Certainly, I was acting in ways no native Iranian would have found reasonable. 
Across the smoke-filled courtyard, I saw a soldier coming at me and knew he meant to force me to submit. I spotted an American flag still burning, dropped to my knees, and grabbed the charred pieces from underneath a classmate‚Äôs feet. As the soldier closed in on me, I ducked and ran, still clutching my charred pieces of flag into a crowd of civilians who had gathered to witness the commotion. The events of that day would come to define all that I have ever stood for ‚Äì or against. 
""Camel Jockey,""""Ayatollah,"" and ""Gandhi"" 
My parents and I soon returned to the United States and I entered third grade. More than anything, I just wanted to be normal, to fit in and be accepted by my peers. Unfortunately, my first name, Nader (which I changed to Nate upon joining the Navy), and my swarthy Middle Eastern appearance, were little help on that score, eliciting regular jibes from my classmates. Even at that young age, they had already mastered a veritable thesaurus of ethnic defamation, including ""camel jockey,""""sand-nigger,""""raghead,""""ayatollah,"" and ironically, ""Gandhi"" (which I now take as a compliment). My classmates regularly sought to ""other-ize"" me in those years, as if I were a lesser American because of my faith and ethnicity. 
Yet I remember that tingling in my chest when I first donned my Cub Scout uniform ‚Äì all because of the American flag patch on its shoulder. Something felt so good about wearing it, a feeling I still had when I joined the military. It seems that the flag I tried to rescue in Tehran was stapled to my heart, or that‚Äôs how I felt anyway as I wore my country‚Äôs uniform. 
When I took my oath of enlistment in the U.S. Navy, I gave my mom a camera and asked her to take some photos, but she was so overwhelmed with pride and joy that she cried throughout the ceremony and managed to snap only a few images of the carpet. She cried even harder when I was selected to serve as the first Muslim-American member of the U.S. Navy Presidential Ceremonial Honor Guard . On that day, I was proud, too, and all the taunts of those bullies of my childhood seemed finally silenced. 
Being tormented because of my ethnicity and religion in those early years had another effect on me. It caused me to become unusually sensitive to the nature of other people. Somehow, I grasped that, if it weren‚Äôt for a fear of the unknown, there was an inherent goodness and frail humanity lurking in many of the kids who bullied and harassed me. Often, I discovered, those same bullies could be tremendously kind to their families, friends, or even strangers. I realized, then, that if, despite everything, I could lay myself bare and trust them enough to reach out in kindness, I might in turn gain their trust and they might then see me, too, and stop operating from such a place of fear and hate. 
Through patience, humor, and understanding, I was able to offer myself as the embodiment of my people and somehow defang the ""otherness"" of so much that Americans found scary. To this day, I have friends from elementary school, middle school, high school, and the military who tell me that I am the only Muslim they have ever known and that, had they not met me, their perspective on Islam would have been wholly subject to the prevailing fear-based narrative that has poisoned this country since September 11, 2001. 
In 1998, I became special assistant to the Master Chief Petty Officer of the Navy and then, in 1999, I was recruited to serve atthe Defense Intelligence Agency. In August 2000, I transferred to the Naval Reserve. 
In the wake of 9/11, I began to observe how so many of my fellow Americans were adopting a fundamentalist ""us vs. them"" attitude towards Muslims and Islam. I suddenly found myself in an America where the scattered insults I had endured as a child took on an overarching and sinister meaning and form, where they became something like an ideology and way of life. 
By the time I completed my military service in 2006, I had begun to understand that our policies in the Middle East,similarly disturbed, seemed in pursuit of little more than perpetual warfare. That, in turn, was made possible by the creation of a new enemy: Islam ‚Äì or rather of a portrait, painted by the powers-that-be, of Islam as a terror religion, as a hooded villain lurking out there somewhere in the desert, waiting to destroy us. I knew that attempting to dispel, through the patient approach of my childhood, the kind of Islamophobia that now had the country by the throat was not going to be enough. Post-9/11 attacks on Muslims in the U.S. and elsewhere were not merely childish taunts. 
For the first time in my life, in a country gripped by fear, I believed I was witnessing a shift, en masse, toward an American fundamentalism and ultra-nationalism that reflected a wanton lack of reason, not to mention fact. As a boy in Iran, I had witnessed the dark destination down which such a path could take a country. Now, it seemed to me, in America‚Äôs quest to escape the verydemons we had sown by our own misadventures in the Middle East, and forsaking the hallmarks of our founding, we risked becoming everything we sought to defeat. 
The Boy in the Schoolyard Grown Up 
On February 10, 2015, three young American students, Yusor Abu-Salha, Razan Abu-Salha, and Deah Shaddy Barakat, were executed at an apartment complex in Chapel Hill, North Carolina. The killer was a gun-crazy white man filled with hate and described by his own daughter as ""a monster."" Those assassinations struck a special chord of sorrow and loss in me. My mom and I cried and prayed together for those students and their families. 
The incident in Chapel Hill also awoke in me some version of the righteous indignation I had felt so many years earlier in that smoke-filled courtyard in Iran. I would be damned if I stood by while kids in my country were murdered simply because of their faith. It violated every word of the oath I had taken when I joined the military and desecrated every value I held in my heart as a sacred tenet of our nation. White nationalists and bigots had, by then, thrown down the gauntlet for so much of this, using Islamophobia to trigger targeted assassinations in the United States. This was terrorism, pure and simple, inspired by hate-speakers here at home. 
At that moment, I reached out to fellow veterans who, I thought, might be willing to help ‚Äì and it‚Äôs true what they say about soul mates being irrevocably drawn to each other. When I contacted Veterans For Peace , an organization dedicated to exposing the costs of war and militarism, I found the leadership well aware of the inherent dangers of Islamophobia and of the need to confront this new enemy. So Executive Director Michael McPhearson formed a committee of vets from around the country to decide how those of us who had donned uniforms to defend this land could best battle the phenomenon ‚Äì and I, of course, joined it. 
From that committee emerged Veterans Challenge Islamophobia (VCI). It now has organizers in Arizona, Georgia, New Jersey, and Texas, and that‚Äôs just a beginning. Totally nonpartisan, VCI focuses on politicians of any party who engage in hate speech. We‚Äôve met with leaders of American Muslim communities, sat with them through Ramadan, and attended their Iftar dinners to break our fasts together. In the wake of the Orlando shooting , we at VCI also mobilized to fight back against attempts to pit the Muslim community against the LGBTQ+ community. 
Our group was born of the belief that, as American military veterans, we had a responsibility to call out bigotry, hatred, and the perpetuation of endless warfare. We want the American Muslim community to know that they have allies, and that those allies are indeed veterans as well. We stand with them and for them and, for those of us who are Muslim, among them. 
Nationalism and xenophobia have no place in American life, and I, for my part, don‚Äôt think Donald Trump or anyone like him should be able to peddle Islamophobia in an attempt to undermine our national unity. Without Islamophobia, there no longer exists a ""clash of civilizations."" Without Islamophobia, whatever the problems in the world may be, there is no longer an ""us vs. them"" and it‚Äôs possible to begin reimagining a world of something other than perpetual war. 
As of now, this remains the struggle of my life, for despite my intense love for America, some of my countrymen increasingly see American Muslims as the ""other,"" the enemy. 
My Mom taught me as a boy that the only thing that mattered was what was in my heart. Now, with her in mind and as a representative of VCI, when I meet fellow Americans I always remember my childhood experiences with my bullying peers. And I still lay myself bare, as I did then. I give trust to gain trust, but always knowing that these days this isn‚Äôt just a matter of niceties. It‚Äôs a question of life or death. It‚Äôs part of a battle for the soul of our nation. 
In many ways, I still consider myself that boy in the school courtyard in Tehran trying to rescue charred pieces of that flag from those trampling feet. It‚Äôs just that now I‚Äôm doing it in my own country.

What Is To Be Done?,"What Is To Be Done? How to build a new anti-interventionist movement Share This 
In the midst of an election in which the issues are largely ignored in favor of sensationalism and smears, the anti-interventionist voter is pretty much at sea. Hillary Clinton‚Äôs demagogic Russia-baiting of Trump as a Kremlin ‚Äúpuppet‚Äù augurs a foreign policy that will take us back to the arctic winter of the cold war, circa 1950 . On the other hand, the GOP nominee, for all his encouraging ‚ÄúAmerica first‚Äù rhetoric and his stated unwillingness to get into another arms race with the former Soviet Union, would likely take us into other quagmires ‚Äì ISIS, China, Iran ‚Äì and, in any event, cannot be trusted. 
So what is to be done? 
The first thing is to disabuse yourself of the notion that any politician or political party currently prominent will magically get us out of the business of Empire. This isn‚Äôt to say that political action is wrong, or ineffective ‚Äì far from it. What I‚Äôm saying is that it is up to us to build a movement out of which a new politics of peace and liberty can be nurtured and brought to maturity. 
Our second task is to take stock of our assets: what kind of shape is the anti-interventionist movement in, and what are our prospects for future growth? 
The first part of that question is easily answered: there is no anti-interventionist movement, as such, and there hasn‚Äôt been for quite some time. Oh sure, there are scattered organizations and individuals with a public platform, but none of these have a truly national presence. 
Yes, Antiwar.com is one such voice with not insignificant reach, but we aren‚Äôt an organization ‚Äì we‚Äôre a web site. We don‚Äôt have chapters, support groups, members, etc., and have quite deliberately avoided setting up any such network for the simple reason that we don‚Äôt have the resources to do so. Every movement has different components that specialize in various functions, and our specialty is education. That is, we give our readers the information they need in order to understand the problem, but as far as acting to eliminate the problem ‚Äì that‚Äôs a mission we must leave to others. 
The big problem is that there are no ‚Äúothers‚Äù ‚Äì no action groups, no lobbyists, no real grassroots organizations that can respond to events as they occur, and mobilize the public against the War Party. The ‚Äúmovement,‚Äù such as it is, is top-heavy with thinktanks ‚Äì the Cato Institute, the Center for the National Interest, the Ron Paul Institute , and the newly-organized student-oriented John Quincy Adams Society come to mind ‚Äì and sorely lacking at the grassroots: essentially, a head with no body. 
This isn‚Äôt because there is no potential for such a grassroots movement: indeed, the objective conditions are ripe ‚Äì I would say over ripe ‚Äì for such an undertaking. Polls consistently show that the American people are increasingly skeptical ‚Äì and that is really too weak a word ‚Äì of foreign entanglements, and basically endorse a foreign policy of minding our own business. This sentiment is one major ‚Äì and deliberately overlooked ‚Äì aspect of the populist ‚Äúresentment‚Äù that catapulted Trump to the top of the GOP ticket and upended the political prognostications of the ‚Äúexperts.‚Äù The idea of putting America first ‚Äì instead of, say, Europe, or the Saudis, or whichever country we‚Äôre supposedly ‚Äòliberating‚Äù at great cost ‚Äì has visceral appeal to ordinary Americans. 
The astonishing fact of the matter is that, a few short years ago, the GOP was the spearhead of the War Party, with militant neoconservatives at its head ‚Äì and is, today, the party of a man who said we were lied into the Iraq war, who wants to basically dismantle NATO, and who has adopted ‚ÄúAmerica First‚Äù ‚Äì a slogan resonant with historical meaning ‚Äì as his campaign theme. 
When I was a kid I used to play a game with a good friend of mine: what would we do if we had a million dollars? Of course, I‚Äôm really dating myself, because today, of course, a million dollars is chump change. In any case, this column is basically a reiteration of that game: what would I do if I had the resources to organize a real grassroots anti-interventionist movement? 
Well, the very first thing I would do is to organize those millions of Trump voters attracted to his banner for precisely the reason the neocons and the foreign policy ‚Äúexperts‚Äù disdain him. Item number one on my agenda would be creating a grassroots America First movement, one with the following three components: 
The America First Action (AFA) groups ‚Äì the function of this organization is implied in its name. Its mission would be to respond to every move by the War Party to involve us in some foreign war by rapidly mobilizing people against it. At the first indication that such a move was in the works, congressional phone lines would be ringing off the hook with howls of protest. This is what happened when President Obama announced he was going to bomb Syria ‚Äì and it worked , with very little central direction. Aside from telephonic harassment of congressional warmongers, AFA would organize meetings, rallies, lecture tours, media appearances, Internet trolling (my favorite!), and every other form of public activity, always focused like a laser on the War Party‚Äôs latest scheme. 
The America First Political Action Committee ‚Äì the electoral arm of the America First movement, AFPAC would help candidates from any and all political parties who oppose foreign wars and entangling alliances. This is one of our greatest weaknesses: currently, the War Party‚Äôs tame politicians are well-rewarded for their labors, while pro-peace candidates are routinely punished financially. The military-industrial-congressional complex takes care of its own ‚Äì we must do the same. Yes, the war profiteers have tremendous resources but we can best them at their own game by appealing to the millions of Americans who are sick and tired of perpetual war. 
The America First Lobby ‚Äì while a different name would probably be best, I‚Äôm calling it a lobby because that is precisely its function. While practically every foreign government on earth has a Washington-based lobby, which meets with government officials and presses its case for more ‚Äúforeign aid,‚Äù and often direct military intervention on their behalf ‚Äì the American people have no such organization, no lobby to pursue and defend their interests. I would take as my model AIPAC, the notoriously powerful pro-Israel lobby, which practically storms Capitol Hill every time Bibi Netanyahu gives the signal. If only anti-interventionist Americans would do the same every time war clouds gather on the horizon, we would put an end to our foreign policy of constant warfare once and for all. 
These three components of a newly constituted America First movement would be supplemented by subsidiary groups targeting specific constituencies. First and foremost, what‚Äôs needed is a student affiliate ‚Äì it‚Äôs been a long time since we‚Äôve heard ‚ÄúHell no, we won‚Äôt go!‚Äù on the nation‚Äôs campuses. And what about abolishing draft registration? Hillary Clinton wants to force women to register for the draft ‚Äì why isn‚Äôt this horrific proposal roiling the student bodies of universities and high schools across the country? 
African-Americans suffer from our foreign policy of global intervention much more than most others: they are, too often, the cannon fodder that feeds the war machine, and if they return they come home to an economy drained by the diversion of vital resources toward war-making and away from productive job-creating and wealth-creating investment. 
Racial minorities, women, rural communities ‚Äì all these groups suffer inordinately as a consequence of an internationalist elite that sacrifices our sons and daughters on the altar of the war god. They can and must be won over to the cause of peace. 
Such a movement isn‚Äôt a pipedream. It can be born ‚Äì and it can prosper to the extent that it organizes itself according to a strategic vision that unites people of various political persuasions around a single issue ‚Äì intransigent opposition to military intervention abroad. 
‚ÄúPeace‚Äù movements launched by the left have failed because they took a multi-issue approach: each and every leftist hobbyhorse was invoked to the point where the central issue ‚Äì war and peace ‚Äì was overshadowed. The organizers of these efforts, which have fallen by the wayside by the dozen, thought they were organizing a political party, which is why these movements never got off the ground. The one time they did manage to achieve some success ‚Äì the antiwar protests of the 1960s ‚Äì was when they junked the multi-issue approach, and focused on the single issue of getting us out of Vietnam. 
The potential is there for such a movement today ‚Äì but only if we cast aside our preconceptions and prejudices, and work to bring together elements that would naturally tend to split apart. Libertarians and Trumpists, Bernie Sanders supporters and ‚Äúisolationist‚Äù conservatives, students at elite universities and rural folks who object to being used as cannon fodder ‚Äì all must be united in a common cause to put America first, and rid ourselves of the albatross of empire. 
It can be done. It must be done. But will it be done? I can‚Äôt answer that question: what I can say is that you, my readers, have the power to do it. Now, if only you have the will‚Ä¶.

255 Killed in Iraq; Baghdad Bombed,"Share This The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights reports that 300 Daesh child soldiers were killed in Mosul operations.

Oklahoma City Catholic Worker Calls for Boycott of the 2016 National Collection for the Archdiocese of Military Services,"Bob Waldrop, founder of the Oscar Romero Catholic Worker House in Oklahoma City, is calling for a boycott of the 2016 national collection in Catholic churches for the Archdiocese of Military Services, accusing the military bishops of material cooperation with the objective evil of unjust war. To facilitate the boycott, he has prepared a half page document that can be printed and placed in the collection plate or offering envelope the weekend of November 5-6, 2016, when the offering is to be collected. A PDF version of the document is available at www.justpeace.org/mscollection.pdf . This has two copies on one page to facilitate distribution.
Text of the boycott call:
I am not giving to the 2016 Archdiocese for Military Services Collection.
The bishops of the Archdiocese for Military Services, together with nearly all of their brother United States Bishops, are guilty of material cooperation with the objective evil of unjust war . In 2003, both Pope John Paul II and then Cardinal Ratzinger , who later became Benedict XVI, condemned our attack on Iraq as an unjust war. In spite of the Pope‚Äôs opposition, the Most Rev. Edwin O‚ÄôBrien , then Archbishop for the Military Services advised Catholic members of the US Armed Forces: ‚ÄúGiven the complexity of factors involved, many of which understandably remain confidential, it is altogether appropriate for members of our armed forces to presume the integrity of our leadership and its judgments and therefore to carry out their military duties in good conscience.‚Äù	
			
Subsequent events have sadly proven the truth, wisdom, and prudence of Pope John Paul II‚Äôs judgment, and the fallacy and danger of the moral relativism embraced by the Bishops of the Archdiocese for Military Services and most of the other US Catholic Bishops regarding unjust war. The consequences cascading from our invasion brought death and injury and social dislocation to hundreds of thousands and devastated the historic Christian communities of Iraq and subsequently Syria. It may fairly be said that those who enabled and supported the war on the people of Iraq are ""secondary terrorists"" in that they created the objective conditions on the ground in the Middle East that are driving the extreme forms of terrorism currently prevalent in the region. Actions have consequences and those who propose the actions must own the consequences.
Therefore, because of these issues, I am not giving to the collection for the Archdiocese of Military Services. Instead, I will donate to an organization working to resolve the problems caused by war.
It is a sad and scandalous day when a people‚Äôs religious leaders fail them so egregiously. I promise to pray for the conversion of the Military Services hierarchy and clergy, and for the moral and physical protection of the members of our Armed Services, who are our sisters, brothers, fathers, mothers, and children. They deserve religious leaders who will courageously preach and teach all of the Gospel of Christ, not just that which is acceptable to the United States Government.

"Rebel Attacks on Syria‚Äôs Aleppo Slow, But Civilian Toll Rises","Heavy Rocket Fire Pounds Government-Held West Aleppo by Jason Ditz, October 31, 2016 Share This 
Nusra Front-led rebels continue to try to push into Western Aleppo in an offensive they launched on Friday, but the advance appears to be slowing to a snail‚Äôs pace amid heavy resistance from the military. At the same time, the rebels continue to fire rockets against the government-held parts of the city. 
Some 84 people have been killed over the course of the offensive, most of them women and children , and the UN has been harshly critical of the rebels for their ‚Äúindiscriminate‚Äù attacks against areas with a large number of civilians present. 
This has been a recurring problem throughout the battle over Aleppo, which has left the city heavy divided and badly damaged. Both sides regularly trade rocket and artillery fire, and both sides seem to have a hard time making such attacks hit anybody except for civilian bystanders. 
Over the past month the military had a seemingly decisive advantage in Aleppo, with the Nusra Front losing a growing amount of territory in the east. This newest counter-offensive is the latest in a long, long line of attempts by different factions within the city to shift the momentum in their favor, which is a big part of why, despite it being heavily contested since 2012, no one appears close to really controlling Aleppo.

ISIS Kills Afghan Tribal Elders in Jalalabad Suicide Attack,"Council of Elders Intended to Set Up Anti-ISIS Coalition by Jason Ditz, October 31, 2016 Share This 
ISIS has killed a number of Afghan tribal elders and wounded several more in Nangarhar Province‚Äôs main city of Jalalabad today, with a suicide bomber from the group targeting a meeting of the council of elders in the city. 
The details are still scant, but ISIS claims that the council was established in part to discuss the formation of a tribal anti-ISIS coalition in the area. They claimed 15 killed and 25 wounded, labeling the victims ‚Äúapostates.‚Äù 
Afghan government officials put the toll a lot lower, saying only four were killed and seven wounded in the attack. Nangarhar is the main base of operations for ISIS forces in Afghanistan, though they‚Äôve recently begun to pop up around several other provinces. 
Whether the council was at the point of establishing an anti-ISIS coalition or not, this is in keeping with the group‚Äôs reaction to any sign of growing local resistance, with ISIS having similarly made an example of tribal groups in Iraq and Syria during their establishment there.

US General: Warplanes Will Kill Fleeing ISIS Fighters Around Mosul,"Iraqi Govt Warns Civilians Against Fleeing Mosul by Jason Ditz, October 31, 2016 Share This 
According to Lt. Gen. Jeffrey Harrigan, the commander of US air forces in the Middle East, the anti-ISIS coalition is now planning on carrying out airstrikes against any fleeing ISIS fighters around Mosul, trying to prevent escape from the massive city with aerial surveillance and targeted strikes. 
This appears to be a response to growing concerns, both within the region and internationally, that the fall of Mosul will mean thousands of seasoned ISIS fighters popping up elsewhere around the world, destabilizing the Middle East and Europe. 
Preventing them from escaping Mosul, however, raises a major concern that the relative lack of US intelligence on who it is targeting, and determination to shoot first and ask questions later is going to lead to US warplanes attacking groups of fleeing civilians that they come across. 
The ‚Äúsolution‚Äù to this appears to be preventing civilians from fleeing the city as well, despite it being an open combat zone that will likely be facing months of combat. Iraqi officials are now said to be warning Mosul civilians not to try to escape, insisting they will be safer if they stay put. 
Staying put in a city during an invasion is far from safe, but suggests US warplanes are going to be particularly indiscriminate in targeting people fleeing Mosul. In the recent offensive against the ISIS city of Manbij, US warplanes killed hundreds of civilians they ‚Äúmistook‚Äù for ISIS, and Mosul is a much larger city with a lot more people to be mistaken for ISIS.

"Syrian Army Enters Metro Damascus Town, Driving Rebels Further Back","Rebels Blame Internal Fights for Growing Losses by Jason Ditz, October 31, 2016 Share This 
The Syrian Army has entered the town of Tel Kurdi , on the outskirts of Damascus, entering the area over the weekend and pushing into yet another rebel-held area, bringing their forces yet closer to the rebel city of Douma, the last major rebel holding around the capital. 
Tel Kurdi, like all the remaining rebel areas in Ghouta, was under siege for some time, and the rebel forces within fell back almost immediately, with no reports of major fighting, and the rebels bragging of a ‚Äúscorched earth‚Äù policy destroying everything of value on their way out. 
One of the members of the rebel council blamed the mounting losses on internal fights among the fashions. Indeed, over the past several months a lot of towns and villages in the area have fallen, either in military offensives or in negotiated pullouts. 
The negotiated pullouts have been the most effective way to displace large amounts of rebels lately, with the rebels getting sent north into Nusra Front territory around Idlib. This is increasingly boiling down to government control of the area around Damascus, and increased rebel influence in the north. Last 5 posts by Jason Ditz",1
MI5 Chief Presents Russia as Growing Threat to British Interests,"Insists Russia Defines Itself by Opposition to the West   
The first time a top British spy has ever given a newspaper interview, MI5 chief Andrew Parker has spoken with the Guardian , playing up the ‚Äúgrowing threat‚Äù posed by Russia against British interests around the world. 
Parker claimed a ‚Äúwhole range of state organs and powers‚Äù in Russia are being brought to bear against Britain and the US, claiming that the advent of cyberwarfare has increased the number of ways in which Russia can move against them. 
Parker went on to claim that Russia defines itself by opposition to the West and, despite being a ‚Äúcovert threat for decades‚Äù has been increasingly hostile, citing their operations in Ukraine and Syria as proof that they are acting to just spite the West. 
This has been a common western talking point, but in practice Western (read: US) policy in both Ukraine and Syria appears to have itself been built with an eye toward being on the opposite side from Russia in the first place, and Russia is then condemned for acting in their own interests. 
This was particularly glaring in Syria, where Russia‚Äôs interest was obviously in the survival of a friendly Syrian government to host their naval base, and where ‚Äúcountering‚Äù Russia has brought the US ‚Äúanti-ISIS coalition‚Äù into increasingly overt support for al-Qaeda‚Äôs Nusra Front, simply because they‚Äôre the ones most directly fighting against Russia.

US Calls on Saudis to End Airstrikes Against Yemen,"No Sign US Is Going to Slow Arms Sales to Saudis   
After a solid 19 months of endorsing the Saudi war in Yemen, selling the Saudis massive amounts of arms, and refueling Saudi bombers over Yemen‚Äôs airspace, the Obama Administration today called on the Saudis to halt airstrikes against Yemen, and accept that there is no military solution. 
A top Human Rights Watch director noted that the call would‚Äôve carried a lot more weight if the US wasn‚Äôt providing the bombs the Saudis are dropping on Yemen in the first place, though former US officials say its almost certain this won‚Äôt include any dial back in US arms sales. 
The call likely reflects the UN‚Äôs peace plan being presented to both sides and immediately rejected by the pro-Saudi officials. Huge civilian death tolls in recent Saudi attacks have added up to make the US a bit more gunshy than usual about supporting the Saudi war publicly. 
At the same time, the US ‚Äúopposition‚Äù to the air war is slim indeed, with the US Ambassador to the UN, Samantha Power, insisting even in the announcement of their opposition to further strikes that the US supports Saudi Arabia‚Äôs right to ‚Äúself-defense,‚Äù which in this case included an outright invasion of a neighboring country. 
The US has insisted Saudi aid is ‚Äúunder review‚Äù since a recent attack on a funeral. That said, there is no sign that any real changes in US policy were made, and the expectation is that, as always, US interest in growing arms exports will win out.  ",1
"First Iraqi Troops Enter Mosul, But Fighting Remains Largely in Suburbs","Military: Goal Is to 'Liberate' Eastern Bank of Tigris River by Jason Ditz, October 31, 2016 Share This 
Iraq‚Äôs invasion of Mosul has entered its third week with a noteworthy first, as the first Iraqi special forces entered the city itself in the area around Karama District, in the far east. There was fighting reported both within the district and in surrounding suburbs. 
Indications are that the vast majority of the fighting in the area remains in the suburbs, with only a small incursion into the city itself. Still, Iraqi military officials say their goal is to take the whole eastern bank of the Tigris River, which divides the city. 
The area entered is near a key industrial site within Mosul. It is unclear how well secured this area is from ISIS‚Äô perspective, as they‚Äôve laid heavy traps and tunneled in around the city in anticipation of the invasion, but indications were that a lot of these defensive measures were taken in residential areas. 
ISIS is believed to have several thousand fighters in Mosul, and with the US announcing they intend to kill anyone who tries to escape, they are likely to resist all the more fiercely, knowing they don‚Äôt have any place to go after Mosul. Last 5 posts by Jason Ditz",1
The End of Obama‚Äôs Term: A Report Card on Latin America,"Share This 
As the end of Obama‚Äôs term in office approaches, it may be of interest to evaluate his performance on Latin America. One of Obama‚Äôs foreign policy promises at the beginning of his first term was to change the way America does business with Latin America. 
The promise to change the way America does business in its backyard was a significant one because the way America has played in its backyard has a long and consistently appalling history. The history of interference and regime change began early when President McKinley betrayed Cuba and stole it under the deceptive promise of liberating it from Spain. In 1903, Theodore Roosevelt severed Panama from Columbia, declared it an independent nation and put in power a government whose first act was to sign over the future Panama Canal. In a little discussed maneuver, the U.S. cooperated with the 1908 removal of Venezuelan President Juan Vicente G√≥mez. In 1909, President Taft removed Nicaragua‚Äôs Jos√© Santos Zelaya because he insisted that US companies in Nicaragua honor their agreements and tried to make his country less dependent on the US by borrowing from European, and not American, banks. 
In the modern era, 1954 saw Eisenhower order the CIA overthrow of Guatemala‚Äôs Jacobo Arbenz. In 1959-1960, Eisenhower would also start the covert action to remove Fidel Castro from Cuba. Kennedy would continue to rain ""the terrors of the earth"" on Cuba. He would also begin the Brazilian coup that would overthrow Goulart in 1964 and undertake a political action to encourage the removal of Cheddi Jagan from power in Guyana. In 1971, Nixon would brutalize Chile with the coup against Salvador Allende. President Omar Torrijos of Panama would die in a plane crash in 1981. In The New Confessions of an Economic Hit Man and in an interview with Amy Goodman on Democracy Now , John Perkins has claimed that Torrijos‚Äô plane crash was another US assassination. Though it has never been proven that Torrijos‚Äô death was a CIA assassination, there is some evidence that, at least earlier, consideration of his assassination was on the table. At the close of 1989, George H.W. Bush, in an unprovoked attack on the civilian population of a nation that had never threatened America, would take out Panama‚Äôs Manuel Noriega. At the end of the last century and the beginning of this one, Jean-Bertrand Aristide was twice removed from power over the popular voice of Haitians. The Latin American coups would continue through George W. Bush‚Äôs unpopular and short lived 2002 removal of Hugo Chavez in Venezuela. 
So, it is not unimportant to evaluate Obama‚Äôs performance on his promise to change this tragic and shameful history. It‚Äôs not unimportant, but it is unimpressive. 
It didn‚Äôt take long for the first indication that nothing had changed. On June 28, 2009, Honduras‚Äô democratically elected President, Manuel Zelaya, was seized at gunpoint, removed in a coup and whisked away in a plane that refueled at a US military base. 
After the coup, US support to the Honduran military only increased. The American ambassador was never recalled, and the US refused to join the call of the United Nation‚Äôs General Assembly and the Organization of American States for the return of the elected President. Though the Organization of American States (OAS) refused to recognize the new coup president, the US State Department refused to join in that too. In fact, following an election that the OAS, the U.N. and others refused to recognize, the US would insist on recognizing the coup government as the victor of the election. 
But, despite the refusal to call Zelaya‚Äôs removal at gunpoint a coup, and despite recognizing the coup government as the legitimate government of Honduras, the Obama White House knew it was a coup. By July 24, 2009, less than a month after the coup, the White House was in receipt of a cable sent from the US embassy in Honduras. In an almost comic lack of subtlety that was clearly never meant to be public, the cable is called ""Open and Shut: the Case of the Honduran Coup"". In it, the embassy says ""There is no doubt that the military, Supreme Court and National Congress conspired on June 28 in what constituted an illegal and unconstitutional coup . . . ."" Their conclusions could not be clearer: the embassy explicitly calls it a ""coup"" and says that ""[t]here is no doubt"". And just in case there were any remaining objections, the cable adds that "". . . none of the . . . arguments [of the coup defenders] has any substantive validity under the Honduran constitution"". 
At best, Obama cooperated with the coup by maintaining silence, though his administration was engaged in dialogue with the rebellious military up to the day of the coup, and by recognizing the coup government as the legitimate government of Honduras. Latin American expert Mark Weisbrot told me in a correspondence that ""the Obama administration acknowledged that they were talking to the [Honduran] military right up to the day of the coup, allegedly to convince them not to do it"". But, he added, ""I find it hard to believe that they couldn‚Äôt convince them not to do it if they really wanted to: the Honduran military is pretty dependent on the US"" The charge was reiterated by Rodolfo Pastor Fasquelle , the minister of culture in the Zelaya government, who said on Democracy Now that ""I know for a fact that CIA operatives and military personnel of the United States were in direct contact with the conspirators of the coup d‚Äô√©tat and aided the conspirators of the coup d‚Äô√©tat."" At worst, Obama was, as Zelaya has always insisted, involved in the coup. Zelaya claims that ""the coup came from the north form the US"" In the heat of the coup, the plane that was carrying the kidnapped president landed at the US military base of Palmerola for fifteen to twenty minutes while it refueled, despite the close proximity of its destination. After the coup, then Secretary of State Clinton has admitted that she aided the coup government by shoring up the coup government blocking the return of the elected government: ""In the subsequent days [after the coup] I spoke with my counterparts around the hemisphere, including Secretary [Patricia] Espinosa in Mexico. We strategized on a plan to restore order in Honduras and ensure that free and fair elections could be held quickly and legitimately, which would render the question of Zelaya moot."" 
After the coup against Zelaya, Ecuador‚Äôs popularly elected president, Rafael Correa, said, ""We have intelligence reports that say that after Zelaya, I‚Äôm next."" He may have been right. 
The year after the Honduran coup, there was an attempted coup on Correa. Although the action failed, Latin American expert Mark Weisbrot says it was clearly an attempted coup to overthrow the government of Rafael Correa. 
Corrrea had renegotiated oil contracts and demanded a bigger share of the big oil companies‚Äô revenue for the people of Ecuador. He also opposed a free trade agreement with the US and closed the US military base in Ecuador. He joined Venezuela, Cuba, Bolivia and Ecuador in the Bolivarian Alliance for the Peoples of Our America (ALBA) and successfully defaulted on over $3 billion of foreign debt that was illegitimately contacted by Ecuadorian leaders Correa said were CIA supported dictators. 
Prior to Obama, the US had started action against Correa. An October 2005 embassy cable sent by US ambassador Linda Jewell outlined action for ""desirable political and economic change in Ecuador."" In 2006, she cabled that a Correa election would ""derail"" US hopes as the embassy expects Correa to join Chavez and other nationalist South American leaders."" In the same cable [06QUITO2150], Jewell said that the US has ""actively discouraged potential alliances"" with Correa. She admitted [06QUITO2991] to ""working in concert with other Ecuadorians and groups who share our vision."" 
During the Obama years, the US would continue to intervene in Ecuador. In March 2009, Ecuador expelled Mark Sullivan, an American official whom they accused of being the CIA station chief in Quito and whom they accused of playing a role in the suspension of US assistance to a special investigative police unit when Ecuador named a new chief of whom the US didn‚Äôt approve. 
On October 30, 2010, the coup Correa had been expecting came. The coup leader was a graduate of the School of the Americas. A government appointed commission found that ""foreign actors"" had been involved in the coup. One of members of the commission announced his belief that the US State Department and the CIA had been involved. 
The same year, Obama failed his next test. That year, America bankrolled the Haitian elections. The cost was 14 million dollars: a price tag that presumably gave America some say. But Haiti‚Äôs Provisional Electoral Council (CEP) banned fourteen parties from running in the election. The CEP was handpicked by the ruling party in a process that is not recognized by Haiti‚Äôs constitution. 
Fanmi Lavalas, the party of Jean Bertrand Aristide, who was twice removed in US sponsored coups, is the largest and the most popular party in Haiti. It has won every election it has been allowed to participate in. That it has been allowed to participate in, that is. But in this US backed election, Fanmi Lavalas was not allowed to participate: it was banned by the CEP. 
The US and its allies continued to influence the Haitian elections when they supported a runoff between two unpopular candidates representing essentially the same side. But the second round runoff between the two candidates was illegal because the CEP never accomplished the number of votes to ratify the first round results that selected them. 
The Obama administration financed the election that specifically excluded the party the people wanted to elect. And, in doing so, Obama broke his foreign policy promise to Latin America and very quietly continued to do business with Latin America in the same interventionist way the US had always done business with Latin America. 
The next indicator of a failing grade came in Paraguay, where in June 2012, Fernando Lugo, the democratically elected leader of Paraguay was removed in a coup. The right wing opposition opportunistically capitalized on a skirmish over disputed land that left at least eleven people dead to unfairly blame the deaths on President Lugo. It then impeached him after giving him only twenty-four hours to prepare his defense and only two hours to deliver it. The Latin American organizations Unasur and Mercosur suspended the new Paraguayan government; the US spent coup day negotiating a new military base in Paraguay. As in Honduras, they never used the word ‚Äúcoup‚Äù. 
But they could have used the word if they hadn‚Äôt wanted to support the coup with their silence. As early as 2009, US embassy cables say that Lugo‚Äôs political opposition has as its goal to ""Capitalize on any Lugo missteps"" and to ""impeach Lugo and assure their own political supremacy"". The cable notes that to achieve their goal, they are willing to ""legally"" impeach Lugo ""even if on spurious grounds"". Obama knew it was a coup: the US had been tipped off about the strategy and told what it would look like. 
The next year, 2013, the interference moved to Venezuela. Against the wishes of the United States, Hugo Chavez‚Äô successor, Nicol√°s Maduro, won the right to continue the Bolivarian Revolution by winning the next national election. America was the only country in the world to refuse to recognize the election results , though 150 electoral monitors from around the world monitored Venezuela‚Äôs election, including delegations from the Union of South American Nations and the Carter Center. 
Two years later, in 2015, the Obama administration again became involved in Venezuela. Contrary to Obama‚Äôs promise, business went on as usual with American money being pumped into Venezuela to fund groups who oppose Maduro. Since 2000, $90 million has poured into Venezuela. That sort of interference in Venezuela is not suggestive of a new way of doing business in Latin America. In 2015, that US funded opposition once again attempted to pull off a coup in Venezuela. Maduro explicitly accused the Americans of, as in 2002, being involved. 
The accusation is not an empty one. Venezuelan officials have produced a significant volume of evidence that the events constitute a failed coup and that the US was involved. They have produced a recording of a communique that was to be issued after the Maduro government was removed from power. They have shown confessions by military officials. And they have admitted as evidence a recorded phone conversation between opposition leaders discussing the coup. The day before the planned coup, Caracas Mayor Antonio Ledezma, who is known to have made phone calls to a US number, Leopoldo Lopez and Maria Corina Machado, both major opposition leader of last year‚Äôs attempt to remove Maduro from power ‚Äì an attempt that they made clear was an attempted coup by saying that they would not to stop until they ‚Äú got rid of Maduro "" ‚Äì signed a National Transition Agreement. Weapons were also found in the office of the opposition party. 
Lucas Koerner of Venezuelanalysis.com adds that the aircraft to be used as part of the failed coup has links to the notorious American security firm Academi (formerly Blackwater). And it has been reported that a number of the coup leaders obtained US visas from the American embassy to facilitate escape should the coup fail. 
And, just this past May, President Maduro has declared a state of emergency, accusing the US of once again conspiring with right wing groups in Venezuela to overthrow his government. Maduro says that ‚ÄúWashington is activating measures at the request of Venezuela‚Äôs fascist right.‚Äù 
In perhaps his final chance to make good on his promise to do business with Latin America differently, Obama has, once again, disappointed by maintaining American silence on the coup in Brazil. How do we know that Obama should have spoken out against the take over of parliament by an unelected party? How do we know that it was a coup? Because the unelected party said so. Twice: both before the coup and after. 
The publication of a transcript of the call between Romero Juc√°, who was a senator at the time of the call and is currently the planning minister in Michael Temer‚Äôs new government, and former oil executive Sergio Machado, provides incontrovertible proof that the removal of the elected President was a coup. The phone call lays bare ‚Äúa national pact‚Äù to remove Dilma and install Temer as President. Juc√° reveals that, not only opposition politicians, but also the military and the Supreme Court are conspirators in the coup. Regarding the military‚Äôs role, Juc√° says, ‚ÄúI am talking to the generals, the military commanders. They are fine with this, they said they will guarantee it.‚Äù And, as for the Supreme Court, Glenn Greenwald reports that Juc√° admits that he ‚Äúspoke with and secured the involvement of numerous justices on Brazil‚Äôs Supreme Court.‚Äù Juc√° further boasted that ‚Äúthere are only a small number‚Äù of Supreme Court justices that he had not spoken to. 
So confident is Michel Temer that he has US support for his coup that he is comfortable to openly boast about it in the US in front of an audience of business and foreign policy leaders. Temer clearly told his American audience that elected President Dilma Rousseff was not removed from power for ""violating fiscal laws by using loans from public banks to cover budget shortfalls, which artificially enhanced the budget surplus"" as the official charge stated. She was, the new, unelected President admitted, removed because of her refusal to implement a right wing economic plan that was inconsistent with the economic platform Brazilians elected her on. Temer‚Äôs economic plan featured cuts to health, education and welfare spending as well as increased emphasis on privatization and deregulation. 
Rousseff was not on board. So she was thrown overboard. In the words of Temer‚Äôs comfortable confession : 
And many months ago, while I was still vice president, we released a document named ‚ÄòA Bridge to the Future‚Äô because we knew it would be impossible for the government to continue on that course. We suggested that the government should adopt the theses presented in that document called ‚ÄòA Bridge to the Future.‚Äô But, as that did not work out, the plan wasn‚Äôt adopted and a process was established which culminated with me being installed as president of the republic. 
Confession. Cased closed. 
And just to remove any doubt that the coup government‚Äôs motivation was not indignation at Rouseff‚Äôs fiscal maneuver, one of the coup government‚Äôs first acts of legislation was to explicitly legalize the very budgetary act they had impeached Rousseff for two days earlier. 
So, once again, at best, Obama gets a low grade on his foreign policy promise for maintaining silence on what he knows to be a coup in Latin America. Silence is support. At worst, he gets a failing grade for cooperating with the coup. 
American participation in the Brazilian coup has not been established. But, ‚Äúthere is no doubt that the biggest players in this coup attempt ‚Äì people like former presidential candidates Jos√© Serra and A√©cio Neves ‚Äì are US government allies,"" according to Latin American exert Mark Weisbrot. And Boaventura de Sousa Santos, Professor of Sociology at the University of Coimbra in Portugal and Distinguished Legal Scholar at the University of Wisconsin-Madison says that Brazil is awash in financing from American sources, including ‚ÄúCIA-related organizations.‚Äù 
The very day after the impeachment vote, Senator Aloysio Nunes of the coup government began a three day visit to Washington . Nunes is a significant player in the coup government: he was the vice-presidential candidate on the 2014 ticket that lost to President Rousseff and a key player in the effort to impeach President Rousseff in the senate. Nunes scheduled meetings with, amongst others, the chairman and ranking member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, Bob Corker and Ben Cardin, as well as with Undersecretary of State and former Ambassador to Brazil Thomas Shannon. Though Nunes denies it, there are reports that his trip to Washington was ordered by Michel Temer. The willingness to go ahead with the planned meetings with Nunes right after the impeachment vote demonstrates, once again, at least tacit acceptance or approval on the part of Washington. 
So, Obama broke his promise. His foreign policy in Latin America may be more silent and more subtle, but the way he has done business with Latin America has not broken from the long line of Presidents who preceded him. At a rapid and consistent rate of almost one each year, Obama has done business as usual in America‚Äôs backyard: 2009 in Honduras; 2010 in Haiti and, perhaps, Ecuador; 2012 in Paraguay; 2013 in Venezuela; 2015 in Venezuela again and 2016 in Brazil.

Justifying the Saudi Slaughter in Yemen,"Latest News Justifying the Saudi Slaughter in Yemen One of Obama's biggest failures is letting his policy in Syria be determined primarily by the ambitions of Qatar, Saudi Arabia and Turkey Share This 
The Obama administration has carried out a deliberately deceptive campaign accusing Iran of covertly sending arms to the Houthis by sea, a claim that Washington cites to help justify the Saudi massive air attack against the Houthis that began last year. 
By repeating the accusation over and over, the administration has been largely successful in turning a dubious allegation into accepted fact, even though it is contradicted by evidence that is well-documented on the public record. 
Secretary of State John Kerry introduced the new variant of the Obama administration‚Äôs familiar theme about Iran‚Äôs ‚Äúnefarious activities‚Äù in the region two weeks after Saudi Arabia began its bombing in Yemen on March 26, 2015. Kerry told the PBS NewsHour, ‚ÄúThere are obviously supplies that have been coming from Iran,‚Äù citing ‚Äúa number of flights every single week that have been flying in.‚Äù Kerry vowed that the United States was ‚Äúnot going to stand by while the region is destabilized.‚Äù 
Later, the administration began accusing Iran of using fishing boats to smuggle arms to the Houthis. The campaign unfolded in a series of four interceptions of small fishing boats or dhows in or near the Arabian Sea from September 2015 through March 2016. The four interceptions had two things in common: the boats did have illicit weapons alright, but the crews always said the ship was bound for Somalia ‚Äì not Yemen and the Houthis. 
But instead of acknowledging the obvious fact that the weapons were not related to the Iran-Houthi relationship, a U.S. military spokesman put out a statement in all four cases citing a U.S. ‚Äúassessment‚Äù that the ultimate destination of the arms was Houthi-controlled territory in Yemen. 
The choice of wording was significant. The intelligence community says that it ‚Äúassesses‚Äù that something is true only when it does not have clear-cut proof on the matter. In the case of the alleged Iranian use of fishing dhows to smuggle arms to the Houthis, the U.S. spokesmen did not cite a single piece of evidence for that ‚Äúassessment‚Äù in any of the four cases. In fact, when asked for some justification for it, the military spokesman refused. 
The first fishing dhow was intercepted in the Arabian Sea on Sept. 25, 2015, by a member of a 31-nation coalition called the Combined Maritime Forces patrolling the Arabian Sea and nearby waters for piracy. The coalition ship found the dhow to be carrying 18 Konkurs anti-tank missiles, 71 other anti-tank shells and 54 missile-launchers. 
Blaming Iran 
The U.S. Navy‚Äôs Fifth Fleet later issued a statement that said, ‚ÄúBased on statements from the dhow‚Äôs crew the port of origin of the dhow and its illicit weapons cache is believed to be Iran.‚Äù It also said the anti-tank missiles were thought to be of Iranian and Russian origin, and that the papers on the ship had indicated that it had been checked by ports and customs officials in Iran‚Äôs Sistan and Baluchistan province. 
But the crew of the vessel had said that it was bound not for Yemen but for Somalia, as the spokesman for the U.S. Fifth Fleet acknowledged to The Associated Press . A Saudi military spokesman suggested that Iran intended to reroute the arms later from Somalia to Yemen, but offered no evidence. 
On Feb. 27, 2016, an Australian ship intercepted a second fishing dhow off the coast of Oman. The Australians found 1,989 AK-47 assault rifles, 100 rocket-propelled grenades and 40 PKM machine guns on board. The Australian Defense Force issued an official statement on the seizure that did not mention Iranian involvement. It said the boat appeared to be ‚Äústateless‚Äù and that its cache of weapons was ‚Äúdestined for Somalia.‚Äù The Australian Defense Force spokesman explained to CNN that the conclusion was based on interviews with crew members. 
But a spokesman for U.S. Naval Forces, Central Command, Lt. Ian McConnaughey gave an entirely different political slant to the interception. In an e-mail to NBC News, McConnaughey said. ‚ÄúBased on the dhow‚Äôs course, Iran is believed to be its port of origin and the source of the illicit weapon,‚Äù he said. McConnaughey said the crew was ‚Äúassessed‚Äù to be Iranian ‚Äì implying that the crew itself had not indicated that. 
McConnaughey acknowledged to NBC and The Telegraph, ‚ÄúAccording to coalition forces it is believed that the vessel‚Äôs destination was in the vicinity of Somalia.‚Äù But the CENTCOM spokesman indicated that it didn‚Äôt matter; the U.S. was insisting on its narrative about covert Iranian arms to the Houthis. 
‚Äú[T]he initial U.S. assessment is the weapons‚Äô final destination was likely to be the Houthis in Yemen,‚Äù McConnaaughey told NBC and The Telegraph. 
When this writer asked McConnaughey by e-mail why the U.S. ‚Äúassessed‚Äù that the weapons were intended for Yemen, despite the evidence to the contrary, he responded, ‚ÄúWe are not going to discuss the intelligence and other information that led us to our assessment.‚Äù 
A Third Shipment 
On March 20, a French navy destroyer intercepted a third fishing dhow off the Island of Socotra in the northern Indian Ocean and found several hundred AK-47 assault rifles, machine guns and antitank weapons. The official statement on the seizure from the Combined Maritime Forces stated categorically, ‚ÄúThe dhow was spotted heading toward Somalia.‚Äù 
And because the weapons were ‚Äúdeemed to be destined for Somalia,‚Äù it explained, they ‚Äúwere seized under the United Nations Security Council mandated arms embargo in accordance with UNSCR 2244(2015).‚Äù That Security Council resolution mandates an embargo on Eritrea. 
Australia and other states participating in the Combined Maritime Forces were thus challenging the U.S. propaganda line. But again the U.S. military used the news media to reinforce the line about Iran smuggling arms to the Houthis. Commander Kevin Stephens, a spokesman for the Fifth Fleet, told CNN that ‚Äúaccording to a U.S. assessment,‚Äù Yemen was the ‚Äúlikely destination‚Äù of the arms. 
A fourth interception ‚Äì the third in three weeks ‚Äì occurred on March 28 by a U.S. Navy ship that was not operating as part of Combined Maritime Forces but directly under U.S. Naval Forces Central Command. That allowed the Naval Forces Central Command to issue its own news story on April 4. 
In its lead paragraph, the report said the United States ‚Äúassessed‚Äù that the shipment of illicit arms on board the dhow ‚Äúoriginated in Iran and was likely bound for Houthi insurgents in Yemen.‚Äù 
An Earlier Ruse 
The Obama administration also had sought to promote the charge that Iranian was covertly sending weapons to the Houthis by sea more than two years earlier. In January 2013, the Yemen client government backed by the United States and Saudi Arabia had claimed that its forces had intercepted a ship with a large cargo of weaponry that came from Iran and was on its way to Yemen to deliver them to the Houthis. 
The Obama administration supported that charge in briefings to journalists. After the Saudi air war against Yemen began in 2015, the U.S. pushed for a report by an experts group on sanctions against Iran that would give the charge credibility. 
But the 2013 claim was soon exposed as a ruse. A Security Council Monitoring Group on Somalia and Eritrea revealed in a June 2013 report that the crewmembers had told diplomats who interviewed them that ship‚Äôs cargo of diesel fuel was bound for Somalia, not Yemen. And, since the weapons were hidden under the diesel fuel tanks, the weapons could be accessed only after those tanks had been emptied, in other words after the ship docked in Somalia. 
The monitoring group learned from authorities in the Puntland region of Somalia, where most of the smuggled weapons have entered the country, that this was a widely used method of smuggling arms into the country. 
Furthermore, the monitoring group determined that the wide range of types of weapons on board the ship, which was intercepted in January 2013, as well as of their original sources indicated that the weapons cache had been assembled by arms merchants. Authorities in Puntland provided data to the monitoring group showing that most of the shipments of weapons into Puntland in the months before January 2013 had come from politically well-connected arms merchants in Yemen. 
Some of the fishing boats that were intercepted with illicit arms on board in 2015-16 had Iranian owners. But the monitoring group report reveals that the real reason is the role of such Iranian fishing vessels in illegal fishing in Somali waters. The vast majority of the hundreds of fishing vessels involved in such illegal fishing networks were either Iranian or Yemeni. As many as 300 were believed to be Yemeni-owned, while Iranian-owned 180 of them. 
The monitoring group said it was investigating unconfirmed reports that some of those illegal fishing vessels were also being used to carry out arms smuggling and that it had established ‚Äúother connections between the illegal fishing networks and networks involved in the arms trade and connected to al-Shabaab in northeastern Somalia.‚Äù 
But the Obama administration has no interest in the considerable evidence gathered by the monitoring group that provides a more credible explanation for the arms found on those four fishing dhows. 
Such an explanation isn‚Äôt political useful, whereas the accusations of Iranian smuggling of arms to the Houthis fulfilled multiple political and bureaucratic interests, justifying Saudi Arabia‚Äôs bloody U.S.-backed air campaign over Yemen and endless Washington alarms about ‚ÄúIranian aggression.‚Äù

Nuclear Weapons ‚Äì The Time for Abolition is Now,"Share This 
Nuclear weapons present the greatest public health and existential threat to our survival every moment of every day. Yet the United States and world nuclear nations stand in breach of the 1968 Nuclear Non-proliferation Treaty which commits these nations to work in good faith to end the arms race and to achieve nuclear disarmament. Forty eight years later the efforts of the nuclear nations toward this goal is not evident and the state of the world is equally as dangerous as it was during the height of the Cold War and arguably more dangerous with current scientific evidence on the catastrophic effects of even limited regional nuclear war. 
This year‚Äôs presidential campaign has once again done little to focus on the dangers of nuclear weapons focusing more on who has the temperament to have their finger on the button with absolutely no indication of any understanding of the consequences to all of humanity by the use of these weapons even on a very small scale. In addition to tensions between Russia and the U.S. in Ukraine and Syria, there is a real danger of nuclear war in South Asia which could kill more than 2 billion people from the use of just 100 Hiroshima size weapons. 
The rest of the world is finally standing up to this threat to their survival and that of the planet. They are taking matters into their own hands and refusing to be held hostage by the nuclear nations. They will no longer be bullied into sitting back and waiting for the nuclear states to make good on empty promises. 
At the United Nations this past week, 123 nations voted to commence negotiations next year on a new treaty to prohibit the possession of nuclear weapons. Despite President Obama‚Äôs own words in his 2009 pledge to seek the security of a world free of nuclear weapons, the US voted ‚Äúno‚Äù and led the opposition to this treaty. 
Rather than meet our obligations under international law, the US has proposed by stark contrast to begin a new nuclear arms race spending $1 trillion dollars over the next 30 years to modernize and rebuild every aspect our nuclear weapons programs. A ‚Äòjobs‚Äô program to end humanity. Each of the nuclear nations is expected to do the same in rebuilding their weapons programs continuing the arms race for generations to come. 
The myth of deterrence is the guise for this effort when in fact deterrence is the principle driver of the arms race. For every additional weapon my adversary has, I need two and so on and so on to our global arsenals of 15,500 weapons. 
Fed up with this inaction and doublespeak, the non-nuclear nations of the world have joined the ongoing efforts of the world‚Äôs NGO, health and religious communities in demanding an end to the madness. Led by the International Campaign to Abolish Nuclear Weapons (ICAN), a global partnership of 440 partners in 98 countries, the International Red Cross, the world‚Äôs health associations representing more than 17 million health professionals worldwide along with religious communities including the Catholic Church and World Council of Churches they are calling for a treaty to ban and eliminate nuclear weapons. 
The effort to ban nuclear weapons has several parallels to the International Campaign to Ban Landmines led by Jody Williams, recipient of the 1997 Nobel Peace Prize. This effort was dismissed and called utopian by most governments and militaries of the world when it was launched by nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) in 1992 only to succeed in 1997 through partnerships, public imagination and political pressure resulting in the ultimate political will. The nuclear ban movement has been vigorously fought by the nuclear nations trying desperately to hold onto their weapons and pressuring members of their alliances to hold the line. 
Unfortunately these weapons and control systems are imperfect. During the Cold War there were many instances where the world came perilously close to nuclear war . It is a matter of sheer luck that this scenario did not come to pass by design or accident. Our luck will not hold out forever. Luck is not a security policy. From a medical and public health stance based on our current evidence-based understanding of what nuclear weapons can actually do, any argument for continued possession of these weapons by anyone in untenable and defies logic. There is absolutely no reasonable or adequate medical response to nuclear war. 
As with any public health threat from Zika, to Ebola, Polio, HIV, prevention is the goal. The global threat from nuclear weapons is no different. The only way to prevent the use of nuclear weapons is to ban and eliminate them. Our future depends upon this. 
President Kennedy speaking on nuclear weapons before the U.N. Security Council in September 1961 said, ‚ÄúThe weapons of war must be abolished before they abolish us‚Äù. Our children‚Äôs children will look back and rightly ask why we the only nation to ever use nuclear weapons remained on the wrong side of history when it came to abolishing nuclear weapons.

"5,561 Killed in Iraq during October","Share This At least 5,561 people were killed and 2,463 were wounded across Iraq during October. These figures are estimates, perhaps even conservative ones. Breaking down the above numbers, we find that 1,629 civilians were killed, and 1,693 were injured. At least 303 security personnel were also killed, and 660 more were wounded in fighting. Militants lost an estimated 3,611 members, while 108 more are known to have been wounded. Again, these are very rough estimates. Also, one U.S. soldier was killed, and at least two French soldiers were wounded during October. Turkish airstrikes left at least 17 Kurdistan Workers Party (P.K.K.) guerrillas dead as well. These figures are much higher than they were in September due to a massive operation that was launched against the city of Mosul. Last month only 2,824 people were killed and 1,208 were wounded. Due to the nature of the fighting in Iraq, accurate numbers may be impossible to obtain. The Iraqi government has been tight with releasing casualty statements concerning security personnel. On the other hand, authorities may be too loose with figures detailing militant losses. Those figures may also represent civilian losses counted as military. In other news: Iraq‚Äôs special forces entered the Gogjiali (Kokjali) district on Monday, which marks the first time security personnel have been within Mosul city limits since the Islamic State militants seized the city in 2014. They were able to progress to the Karama neighborhood. A Reuters reporter in nearby Bazwaya village ‚Äî which was recaptured today ‚Äî could see smoke rising from the Karama battle, and soldiers also fought in the Aden district. There are also new reports of resistance fighters attacking militants in the city. Special forces also captured the eastern villages of Subhi, Sunaidii, and Tubruq. Shi‚Äôite militiamen reported freeing the western villages of Abu Shwayha, Albu Juradi, Arish, Aslya Huwaysh, Dalawiya Al Sharqiyan, Imam Hamza, Hasuna, Kharani Gargara, Khurba Tayir, Mushairafa, Sahi Abas, Sruj, Um Shanin, Um Sijqn, Zuwai‚Äôza‚Äôs, and Tal Shikham. On the northern front, troops liberated Najmook, Shalalat, and Tal Yabis. At least 408 people were killed and 71 were wounded in recent violence: Militants executed 300 people , civilians and former security personnel, north of Mosul in the village of Moshairefa . In Baghdad , at least 16 people were killed and 50 were wounded in various attacks around the city. Gunmen killed a Peshmerga soldier in Tel Skuf , as he was trying to defuse a bomb. In Mosul , militants killed 50 of their own and mutilated 20 others for fleeing the fighting. Seven militants were killed in fighting in the Aden district. An explosion killed several militant leaders. Read more by Margaret Griffis",1
Islamophobia Must be Fought and Defeated,"When I was a lieutenant colonel on active duty, I supervised an officer in the U.S. Air Force who was (and is) an Iraqi-American. He came to the US as a boy after President George H.W. Bush‚Äôs call to the Shia to revolt against Saddam in the aftermath of Desert Storm, which was ruthlessly suppressed by Saddam as Bush and company did nothing.
As an Iraqi-American in uniform, he served as an interpreter attached to the 101st Airborne in Iraq in 2004, if memory serves‚Äìdangerous times indeed for US troops in Iraq.
He wrote to me, rightly outraged, after Ben Carson made his anti-Muslim comments back in September of 2015 during the presidential primary season. It made him so sad, so angry, as a US Air Force veteran and as a Muslim-American to hear such ignorance, such bias, such Islamophobia. And it made me angry as well.

So many Muslim-Americans have served this country with distinction, troops like Navy veteran Nate Terani, who has written an eloquent article at TomDispatch.com on the prejudice he faced as an Iranian-American. Terani is doing his best to fight a new enemy, Islamophobia, the irrational fear of Islam fed by the unhinged rhetoric of candidates like Ben Carson and Donald Trump.
Here is how Terani puts it in his article :
In Iran, theocratic fundamentalists sowed division and hatred of outsiders‚Äìof Westerners, Christians, and other religious minorities. Here in America, the right wing seems to have stolen passages directly from their playbook as it spreads hatred of immigrants, particularly Muslim ones. This form of nationalistic bigotry‚ÄìIslamophobia‚Äìthreatens the heart of our nation. When I chose to serve in the military, I did so to protect what I viewed as our sacred foundational values of liberty, equality, and democracy. Now, 20 years later, I‚Äôve joined forces with fellow veterans to again fight for those sacred values, this time right here at home. 
As America builds walls and weapons and wages war all over the globe, as our leaders look outward for enemies, we‚Äôre forgetting the enemy within America, the enemy that is a much more serious threat to our national security. That enemy, which exists right here in America‚Äôs heartland, is ignorance, hatred, fear, aggression, compounded by a cowardly desire to ‚Äúget even‚Äù and to ‚Äúmake America great again‚Äù by ostracizing other Americans who are considered ‚Äúdifferent‚Äù and ‚Äúuntrustworthy.‚Äù
But spreading fear and bigotry is not a way to national security; it‚Äôs a way to national insanity. Islamophobia, like all other irrational fears, must be fought and defeated.

New Poll: Americans Feel Less Safe After 15 Years of War,"We were told that we had to attack Iraq because the Saddam Hussein government made us less safe. We were told we had to bomb and kill Gaddafi in Libya because his regime made us less safe. Ditto with the Taliban in Afghanistan and Assad in Syria. Now. 15 years after 9/11, Americans are seeing through the endless wars that have lasted through the Bush and Obama Administrations. Trillions spent, untold thousands killed, societies destroyed, people displaced. A new poll sponsored by the Center for the National Interest and the Charles Koch Institute has found that Americans feel less, not more safe after a decade and a half of war. We are reaching the critical mass where Americans begin to demand a change in our interventionist foreign policy. More on the encouraging poll in today‚Äôs Ron Paul Liberty Report:

US Airstrike Kills Eight Civilians Near Mosul,"US Promises 'Further Investigation' Into Attack in Fadhiliya by Jason Ditz, November 01, 2016 Share This 
On October 22, US warplanes carried out airstrikes against the village of Fadhiliya, a few kilometers away from the city of Mosul. Two of the strikes hit a civilian house within, killing eight civilians from a single family, including three children. 
It is unclear why the report of this airstrike is just coming to light now, over a week later, but it marks the first significant civilian casualties in a US airstrike related to the Mosul invasion. A previous incident the day before, initially reported as a US airstrike against a Shi‚Äôite mosque near Kirkuk, is now being reported as likely an attack by the Iraqi Air Force, and not the US. 
Pentagon officials confirmed conducting a number of airstrikes against Fadhiliya at the time of the civilian deaths, and say they are conducting ‚Äúfurther investigation‚Äù to determine all the facts related to the attack. Saying the take the allegations seriously. 
As the fighting around Mosul advances into more densely populated areas around the city itself, the concerns are growing that such airstrikes are going to cause a number of civilian casualties. This is doubly true because now Iraq is warning residents of Mosul against fleeing, and the US has announced its intention to carry out airstrikes to prevent ‚Äúfleeing ISIS‚Äù from getting away.

"24 Killed, Mostly Civilians, as Indian, Pakistani Forces Trade Fire in Kashmir","Both Blame Other Side for Fueling Tensions Along Line of Control by Jason Ditz, November 01, 2016 Share This 
One villager in the area described the situation as like a ‚Äú full blown war, ‚Äù as Pakistani and Indian troops have exchanged a growing amount of fire across the Line of Control in Kashmir. The latest firing began on Friday and has continued to grow ever since. 
Both sides are accusing the other, as usual, of starting the situation, and civilians living along the LoC are being evacuated in growing numbers. Since Friday at least 24 people have been killed in the firing , with the majority of them civilian bystanders. 
This is the latest dust-up along the LoC since September, when militants attacked Indian forces within Kashmir and India responded with raids across the LoC, getting into fights with the Pakistani military on the other side. 
Both sides say the latest firing from the other side was ‚Äúunprovoked,‚Äù though in reality tensions have been boiling under the surface ever since the September incidents. The focus right now appears to be entirely on shifting blame for starting the fighting, with neither side seeming at all eager to stop firing. Last 5 posts by Jason Ditz",1
Russia: Rebel Attacks Around Aleppo Jeopardize Pause in Airstrikes,"Warns Russia Can't Maintain Pause if Strikes Continue by Jason Ditz, November 01, 2016 Share This 
Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov warned today that the moratorium on Russian airstrikes around Aleppo is in jeopardy from the continued rebel attacks against positions around government-held Western Aleppo. 
Peskov insisted Russia wants to enable to exit of civilians from rebel Eastern Aleppo, and to create conditions wherein humanitarian aid can be delivered to the city. Russia has paused its airstrikes for about two weeks now to that end. 
While it seemed early on that Russia could afford to be patient, with Eastern Aleppo surrounded and the Syrian military doing well in clashes with the Nusra Front. Late last week, however, Nusra and their allies launched a major counterattack, which has been raging since. 
The counterattack came from outside the city, trying to end the siege on the east and threatening government-held territories in the west. Russia has so far not gotten involved, and while the Syrian military seems to have staved off any huge defeats, this likely adds to pressure from Russia‚Äôs Defense Ministry. 
Though President Putin has so far insisted the pause should continue, the defense ministry has made much of calling for an end to it and resuming airstrikes. It is unusual for them to publicly dissent from official policy, and the pick-up in fighting will only increase those calls. Last 5 posts by Jason Ditz",1
UN: All Sides in Aleppo May Be Committing War Crimes,"A new statement from the UN Human Rights spokeswoman Ravina Shamdasani warned that there is growing evidence that all sides fighting around the northern Syrian city of Aleppo are engaged in war crimes by conducting indiscriminate strikes in civilian-populated areas. 
Shamdasani warned that while the UN lacked details to attribute individual attacks to different factions in the area, the indications are that everyone has basically ignored the ‚Äúfundamental prohibition‚Äù on launching such attacks when civilians are present. 
This has been a recurring concern for months in Aleppo, with large civilian casualties reported on a disturbingly regular basis. And while most of the international forces with an interest in Syria are keen to exclusively blame one side or the other, civilians in both sides‚Äô neighborhoods are being killed. 
Russia has paused their airstrikes against Aleppo over the past couple of weeks, though an escalation in fighting further west has meant civilian casualties have continued, with reports of chlorine gas attacks by Nusra forces against government-held areas. Last 5 posts by Jason Ditz",1
Russian DM: Syria Peace Talks Indefinitely Postponed,"Blames Western Failure to Rein in Islamist Factions by Jason Ditz, November 01, 2016 Share This 
While there really hasn‚Äôt been any indication that such talks were going to happen soon at any rate, Russian Defense Minister Sergey Shogu made it official today that Syrian peace talks are ‚Äú postponed for an indefinite period .‚Äù 
Shogu insisted there were no prospects for new peace talks right now because the West had failed to rein in Islamist rebel factions in the country, adding that this continued in spite of Russia pausing their air strikes against Aleppo. 
The previous ceasefire in Syria had been negotiated with an eye on separating the Islamist factions like the Nusra Front from more moderate rebel groups. The US made a public statement calling for such a separation, but it never happened, and ultimately, Russia started trying to convince Turkey and Saudi Arabia to try. None have accomplished anything so far. 
In the meantime, the US and its allies began angrily condemning Russia and Syria for attacking the Nusra Front, complaining it proved Russia doesn‚Äôt want peace. This too is adding to doubts about getting new talks started, with everyone seemingly agreeing Nusra can‚Äôt participate in the peace process, but not able to get them split in meaningful ways from the rebel factions that might be welcomed.

"Turkey Deploys Tanks, Artillery Along Iraq Border","DM: Deployments Aim to Prepare for 'Developments in the Region' by Jason Ditz, November 01, 2016 Share This 
Adding to concerns about tensions between the Turkish and Iraqi government, Turkey has deployed a convoy of tanks and artillery along the Iraqi border today, a move they say it meant to prepare for any potential ‚Äúdevelopments‚Äù in the region. 
The deployment appears to be centered on the area around Mosul. Turkish President Erdogan promised to participate in the invasion of Mosul, but was spurned by the Abadi government in Iraq. This has been an ongoing argument between the two sides, and the deployment may suggest Turkey plans an involvement in Mosul, however unwelcome. 
The deployment also comes following a recent spate of fighting with the Kurdish PKK inside southeastern Turkey, and some reports have speculated that the deployment could be intended as further force against the PKK forces on the Iraqi side of the border. 
While Turkey has been fighting Kurdish factions pretty much everywhere for decades, the government has picked up its attacks against the Kurdish YPG in Syria over the past month, and also claimed a ‚Äú natural right ‚Äù to invade Iraq if they are threatened. Last 5 posts by Jason Ditz",1
Let‚Äôs Reduce the US Nuclear Arsenal,"Share This 
At present, nuclear disarmament seems to have ground to a halt. Nine nations have a total of approximately 15,500 nuclear warheads in their arsenals, including 7,300 possessed by Russia and 7,100 possessed by the United States. A Russian-American treaty to further reduce their nuclear forces has been difficult to secure thanks to Russian disinterest and Republican resistance. 
Yet nuclear disarmament remains vital, for, as long as nuclear weapons exist, it is likely that they will be used. Wars have been fought for thousands of years, with the most powerful weaponry often brought into play. Nuclear weapons were used with little hesitation by the US government in 1945 and, although they have not been employed in war since then, how long can we expect to go on without their being pressed into service again by hostile governments? 
Furthermore, even if governments avoid using them for war, there remains the danger of their explosion by terrorist fanatics or simply by accident. More than a thousand accidents involving US nuclear weapons occurred between 1950 and 1968 alone. Many were trivial, but others could have been disastrous. Although none of the accidentally launched nuclear bombs, missiles, and warheads‚Äïsome of which have never been found‚Äïexploded, we might not be as lucky in the future. 
Also, nuclear weapons programs are enormously costly. Currently, the US government plans to spend $1 trillion over the next 30 years to refurbish the entire US nuclear weapons complex. Is this really affordable? Given the fact that military spending already chews up 54 percent of the federal government‚Äôs discretionary spending, an additional $1 trillion for nuclear weapons ""modernization"" seems likely to come out of whatever now remains of funding for public education, public health, and other domestic programs. 
In addition, the proliferation of nuclear weapons to additional countries remains a constant danger. The nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT) of 1968 was a compact between the non-nuclear nations and nuclear-armed nations, with the former forgoing nuclear weapons development while the latter eliminated their nuclear arsenals. But the nuclear powers‚Äô retention of nuclear weapons is eroding the willingness of other nations to abide by the treaty. 
Conversely, further nuclear disarmament would result in some very real benefits to the United States. A significant reduction in the 2,000 US nuclear weapons deployed around the world would reduce nuclear dangers and save the US government enormous amounts of money that could fund domestic programs or simply be returned to happy taxpayers. Also, with this show of respect for the bargain made under the NPT, non-nuclear nations would be less inclined to embark on nuclear weapons programs. 
Unilateral US nuclear reductions would also generate pressures to follow the US lead. If the US government announced cutbacks in its nuclear arsenal, while challenging the Kremlin to do the same, that would embarrass the Russian government before world public opinion, the governments of other nations, and its own public. Eventually, with much to gain and little to lose by engaging in nuclear reductions, the Kremlin might begin making them as well. 
Opponents of nuclear reductions argue that nuclear weapons must be retained, for they serve as a ""deterrent."" But does nuclear deterrence really work? Ronald Reagan , one of America‚Äôs most military-minded presidents, repeatedly brushed off airy claims that US nuclear weapons had deterred Soviet aggression, retorting: ""Maybe other things had."" Also, non-nuclear powers have fought numerous wars with the nuclear powers (including the United States and the Soviet Union) since 1945. Why weren‚Äôt they deterred? 
Of course, much deterrence thinking focuses on the safety from nuclear attack that nuclear weapons allegedly provide. But, in fact, US government officials, despite their vast nuclear armada, don‚Äôt seem to feel very secure. How else can we explain their huge financial investment in a missile defense system? Also, why have they been so worried about the Iranian government obtaining nuclear weapons? After all, the US government‚Äôs possession of thousands of nuclear weapons should convince them that they needn‚Äôt worry about the acquisition of nuclear arms by Iran or any other nation. 
Furthermore, even if nuclear deterrence does work, why does Washington require 2,000 deployed nuclear weapons to ensure its efficacy? A 2002 study concluded that, if only 300 US nuclear weapons were used to attack Russian targets, 90 million Russians (out of a population of 144 million) would die in the first half hour. Moreover, in the ensuing months, the enormous devastation produced by the attack would result in the deaths of the vast majority of survivors by wounds, disease, exposure, and starvation. Surely no Russian or other government would find this an acceptable outcome. 
This overkill capacity probably explains why the US Joint Chiefs of Staff think that 1,000 deployed nuclear weapons are sufficient to safeguard US national security. It might also explain why none of the other seven nuclear powers (Britain, France, China, Israel, India, Pakistan, and North Korea) bothers to maintain more than 300 nuclear weapons . 
Although unilateral action to reduce nuclear dangers might sound frightening, it has been taken numerous times with no adverse consequences. The Soviet government unilaterally halted nuclear weapons testing in 1958 and, again, in 1985. Starting in 1989, it also began removing its tactical nuclear missiles from Eastern Europe. Similarly, the US government, during the administration of US president George H.W. Bush, acted unilaterally to remove all US short-range, ground-launched nuclear weapons from Europe and Asia, as well as all short-range nuclear arms from US Navy vessels around the world‚Äïan overall cut of several thousand nuclear warheads. 
Obviously, negotiating an international treaty that banned and destroyed all nuclear weapons would be the best way to abolish nuclear dangers. But that need not preclude other useful action from being taken along the way.

US Officials See No Link Between Trump and Russia,"Clinton Campaign Demands FBI Affirm Trump's Russia Ties   
With the 2016 election campaign winding down, the Clinton campaign is ratcheting up demands for the FBI to publicly confirm the campaign‚Äôs allegations that Republican nominee Donald Trump is secretly in league with Russia. Sen. Harry Reid (D ‚Äì NV) went so far as to claim the FBI has secret ‚Äúexplosive‚Äù evidence of coordination between the Trump campaign and the Russian government that it is withholding. 
FBI officials familiar with their investigations into the allegations, which the Clinton campaign started publicizing around the Democratic National Convention, say they‚Äôve turned up nothing to connect Trump and Russia , leading FBI Director James Comey to decide against making any statements to that effect. 
The Clinton campaign has been making the allegations so long that they have taken to claiming ‚Äúeveryone knows‚Äù that they are true, and appears unsettled by the FBI‚Äôs refusal to sign off on the claims simply because they haven‚Äôt been able to find real evidence corroborating the story. 
The Trump campaign has repeatedly denied ties to Russia, but that didn‚Äôt stop Clinton from calling Trump a ‚Äúpuppet‚Äù of Russian President Vladimir Putin during the final presidential debate. The calls have grown since Friday‚Äôs FBI report to Congress about further Clinton emails being sought. 
With Clinton‚Äôs main campaign scandal growing in the waning weeks of the deal, some in her campaign have suggested that affirming Trump as secretly in league with the Russians would only be fair. Absent any evidence, however, it appears that won‚Äôt be happening.  ",1
ISIS Killing Former Soldiers in Areas Around Mosul,"At Least 40 Killed Over Weekend, UN Reports   
ISIS has been reported to be using a fleet of trucks and minibuses to transport the civilian population of the area around Mosul into the city itself, which officials are saying they believe is a sign that ISIS intends to use them as human shields. 
While the human shields thing is purely speculative, what appears to be more certain is that those former Iraqi military personnel that ISIS is coming across in their forced busing are being executed, with reports that some 40 were killed over the weekend and thrown into the Tigris River . 
This has been a recurring concern for ISIS since the Mosul battle began. ISIS executed some of their own fighters in the lead-up when they were claimed to be working with the Iraqi government, and have been desperate to purge any other potentially disloyal elements around the city. 
While the UN was harshly critical of ISIS for forcibly relocating people around Mosul, they have so far been mum on government warnings that civilians in Mosul not attempt to escape the city, warnings which came amid announcements that the US intends to launch airstrikes against ‚Äúfleeing ISIS fighters.‚Äù  ",1
Who Gains From Colombia‚Äôs Vote for Permanent War?,"Share This 
In early October, the Colombian people voted NO to peace. 
Or to be exact, 50.2 percent of 37 percent of the eligible population voted no. In the referendum held on October 2, the majority of voters decided to scuttle the agreement between the government and FARC rebels, which had been reached after four years of peace talks dedicated to ending 52 years of bloodshed. 
The vote came just days after the celebratory signing of the agreement, which was lauded in the international community for achieving a bridge between historic enemies and dealing broadly with the root causes of the conflict. The rest of the world was stunned. 
Most pundits have begun the post-mortem analysis of the referendum by saying something like ‚ÄúColombians did not vote against peace.‚Äù They go on to discuss other factors, including people‚Äôs ignorance of the accords, or their mistaken belief that after four years it could simply be renegotiated. 
But the fact of the matter is that the NO voters voted clearly and unambiguously to continue the war. The words on the ballot read: ‚ÄúDo you accept the final agreement to terminate the conflict and build a stable and lasting peace?‚Äù It‚Äôs almost inconceivable that any population would vote no on this proposition, but they did. 
So why did they? 
Although even former president Alvaro Uribe, the nation‚Äôs leading warmonger, now makes the politically correct statement that the ultimate goal is peace, the macho sentiments of total domination and punishment (of one side), along with a strong dose of Cold War hysteria (yes, in the 21 st century) won the day. 
The NO promoters knew what they were doing. They were not promoting an alternative peace. As a 32-year old NO voter quoted in the New York Times put it, ‚ÄúIf ‚Äòno‚Äô wins, we won‚Äôt have peace, but at least we won‚Äôt give the country away to the guerrillas.‚Äù 
His statement reflects the patriarchal logic that has started and perpetuated wars since time immemorial ‚Äì the only good enemy is a dead enemy, and if I don‚Äôt win, nobody wins. 
At least some NO voters and many of the leaders are betting on continuing war until they gain by force their entire military and political agenda ‚Äì a prospect that, given the war‚Äôs longevity to date could easily be another half century. Or never. 
The Perks of Permanent War 
For many NO promoters, including Uribe himself, ‚Äúnever‚Äù could be the best-case scenario. Basking in the limelight of a political career rebuilt on the ruins of one the most complex and progressive peace agreements in history, Uribe released proposals for revamping the peace agreement designed to throw a monkey wrench into any process to salvage peace in Colombia. 
Analysts quoted on CNN‚Äôs Spanish channel observed that Uribe‚Äôs wish list is aimed at ‚Äútorpedoing the peace accords.‚Äù That‚Äôs correct: No one expects the FARC to accept Uribe‚Äôs terms, which include banning the group from politics, sentencing members to 5-8 year prison terms for crimes including drug trafficking, pardoning Colombia‚Äôs security forces for their own serious crimes, and eliminating the meticulously negotiated Tribunal for Transitional Justice. 
Huge sectors of the population reject Uribe‚Äôs terms as well, since his proposals would also wipe out the parts of the peace accord that regulate the return of stolen lands to peasant and indigenous communities and seriously hamper, if not strike altogether, plans for reparations to victims. They also could rollback meticulously negotiated gains in gender justice and LGBT rights. 
To pretend that everyone wants peace and the only issue is how to get it is to ignore the fact that the war benefits many powerful interests. Those interests will fight to keep fighting. 
On the political front, war assures military control over a population and justifies authoritarianism and repression through fear. In general, the most militarized parts of the country are areas where peasants, Afro-Colombians, and indigenous peoples are defending their lands and resources from the incursions of transnational corporations and mega development projects. Fear and murder are powerful repressive tools. 
War is also a huge business. Thanks to U.S. Plan Colombia and policies that fanned the conflict, Colombia became the third largest recipient of US aid in the world during the war, behind only Israel and Egypt. Colombia‚Äôs budget for security forces skyrocketed ; between 2001 and 2005, it grew more than 30 percent, and by 2006 it was double its 1990 levels ‚Äì some $4.48 billion for military and police. 
US Interests 
The US military-industrial complex also has a vested interest in continuing the war. The conflict justified Plan Colombia, the $10 billion dollar counterinsurgency and counternarcotics plan that allowed the Pentagon to establish a military presence in Colombia, both physically and by proxy. With the pretext of Colombia‚Äôs internal conflict, the US government built up a platform not only for control in Colombia, but also for regional strike capacity, as leaked in the proposed agreement to establish seven US military bases. 
Plan Colombia and its later incarnations kept US contracts for weapons, espionage, intelligence equipment, and military and police training flowing to the most powerful lobbying industries in the nation. Billions of dollars have been poured into Plan Colombia and national security investments that ended up in the pockets of political elites and US defense companies. In the budgets for fiscal years 2010-2017, the United States allocated over $2 billion in military and police aid ‚Äì most of that during the peace talks. 
In the process, Colombia was converted into a testing ground for the latest in counterinsurgency and unconventional warfare techniques and equipment from the United States. The blood spilled on its soil feeds the global war machine, to such an extent that Colombia has been groomed as an exporter of counterinsurgency and ‚Äúsecurity‚Äù training, despite its reputation as a gross violator of human rights and the disastrous humanitarian impact of its prolonged war. Colombian forces now work throughout the region to promote the same counternarcotics-counterinsurgency model that left more than 5 million people displaced and untold thousands of innocent peasants executed by security forces. 
So very powerful interests saw the peace agreement as a threat. In addition to Uribe followers who viewed it as soft on the FARC, the war economy of the nation and its ally, the United States, was at stake. 
In this context, the US government reacted tepidly when peace was voted down. Bernard Aronson, the special envoy to the peace talks, expressed no regret in a press interview after the vote, stating, ‚ÄúWe believe Colombians want peace, but clearly they are divided about terms of settlement.‚Äù The State Department limited its statement to support for Colombian democracy and further dialogue. After four years of ostensibly supporting the peace talks, neither mentioned the vote as a setback. 
An analysis published by the US Army War College, although it is not an official document, openly expresses relief at the continuation of indefinite war in Colombia. Through a mixture of hawkish arguments and lies , the analysis recognizes that the country now enters into a ‚Äúperiod of uncertainty,‚Äù but notes that this ‚Äúpresents a strategic situation less grave and more manageable, than had the accords been approved.‚Äù 
It goes on to predict that the FARC will likely break the ceasefire, despite the group‚Äôs explicit and public commitment to respect it even in the absence of the guarantees provided in the peace agreement. This position ‚Äì coming from sources close to the US military, which has in many senses called the shots in Colombia‚Äôs war since Plan Colombia began in 2000 ‚Äì indicates that there is a dangerous possibility of a provocation to further undermine the peace process that has now been thrown into crisis by the NO vote. 
The writers also advise President Juan Santos, who staked his political capital on supporting the deal, to retract his commitment to the ceasefire following the vote. They note that Santos promised to ‚Äúnot authorize military operations in the areas where FARC units are located in order to avoid an incident which breaks the fragile truce. Yet not doing so will allow FARC dissidents to operate with almost complete impunity in these areas. Indeed, within the new background of uncertainty, such impunity will increase incentives for FARC units to continue illicit activity, such as drug trafficking, since doing so will pose relatively low risks.‚Äù 
War Engenders More War, Not Peace 
Before the NO vote, the US press hailed Plan Colombia for making peace possible. President Obama, in his self-congratulatory last speech to the UN, proclaimed that we ‚Äúhelped Colombia end Latin America‚Äôs longest war.‚Äù The logic of this bizarre argument went that were it not for the military debilitation of the guerrillas thanks to the U.S.-Colombian military alliance, the FARC could never have been brought to the negotiating table. 
The NO vote is the classic example of the fallacy of that logic. The war fomented by Plan Colombia built up a mentality that made peace an unacceptable solution for many. It revealed the fundamental clash of perspectives between diplomacy and annihilation. 
The lesson couldn‚Äôt be clearer: War is a terrible preparation for peace. Peace depends on much more than a favorable correlation of forces. Peace, at its core, is a rejection of force as the way to confront differences, and a search for nonviolent solutions to conflict and conflict prevention. 
With US military theorists openly calling for reopening hostilities, it is a dangerous myth to assume that at this juncture everyone wants peace and the only open question is how to do it. Plan Colombia, the U.S.-sponsored war on drugs, and Uribe‚Äôs ‚ÄúDemocratic Security‚Äù policy all posit continued militarization. Those who promote peace and reconciliation in the country must deal with that mentality head on. To second-guess or justify NO voters with ‚Äúthey-know-not-what-they-do‚Äù arguments reflects the kind of complacency and misreading of the public that created this dangerous debacle in the first place. 
There is no doubt that a massive campaign of misinformation and scaremongering played a role. Voters were bombarded with alarmist messages that spun out wild scenarios, from a legislative takeover by the former FARC to a ‚ÄúChavez-Castro style dictatorship.‚Äù CNN‚Äôs footage of the NO celebration showed the crowd chanting ‚ÄúThe NO won, now we won‚Äôt have a Cuban dictatorship.‚Äù It didn‚Äôt seem to matter that there was no logical relationship between voting for the peace agreement and the nation becoming a dictatorship. 
For followers of Uribe, who led the massive campaign against the negotiations and the acceptance of the agreement, the vote was ideological and personal. It represented the right against the left, and Uribe against Santos. For many people stuck in bitter partisan politics, to vote for peace was to vote in favor of the latter. 
It is also likely that many people did not have a clear understanding of the accords or their implications, which is a failing of the negotiators and SI (yes) promoters that left a fatal opening for NO propaganda. Some voters also apparently believed that four years of arduous negotiations with the technical support of scores of international experts and mediators could simply be reopened and ‚Äúfixed‚Äù to their liking, though Santos made it clear there was ‚Äúno Plan B.‚Äù Some NO voters quoted in the press even expressed dismay that they had won, believing they were merely casting a protest vote. 
Despite these factors, the NO vote reveals a major obstacle: Society has been trained over years of conflict ‚Äì one of the longest-running internal conflicts in the world ‚Äì to acquiesce to war as the only response, to dehumanize the enemy and overlook the obvious fact that it takes two sides to sustain hostilities. It‚Äôs created a society that believes the only solution is to drive the enemy into the ground ‚Äì even when they are men and women from one‚Äôs own country and their grievances reflect serious social problems. 
This is the patriarchal mentality that the war industry thrives on. Plan Colombia has fomented this mentality since it began. It conflated a war on drugs with a counterinsurgency war to justify foreign intervention and broaden the war. The US government knew that military funding was going directly to paramilitary groups. A 2010 empirical study demonstrated a measurable relationship between increases in US security funding and paramilitary homicides. War propaganda presented the FARC as the sole culprit, when terrible atrocities were being committed on both sides. 
With the exceptions of Arauca and Norte de Santander, the departments on Colombia‚Äôs borders that have suffered most in the war voted to end it. They know what it‚Äôs like to feel their houses shaken by bombs, to risk life and limb walking through minefields, to lose their loved ones in crossfire. They know that to stop the violence in their day-to-day lives is far more important than the political games of how punishment and power are dished out. 
War as a policy is almost always favored by those farthest from the battlefields. 
The Road to Peace 
Understanding the very real and perilous obstacles is not the same as being pessimistic or defeatist at this point in the Colombian peace process ‚Äì it‚Äôs a process, after all. It‚Äôs important not to minimize the enormity of this setback ‚Äì President Santos‚Äô Nobel Peace Prize may be deserved, but it‚Äôs a sorry consolation prize for having gotten so close only to be slapped down. But it‚Äôs also important to acknowledge that there is still room to move forward. 
The peace accords opened up a dialogue and allowed the nation to envision peace. Grassroots organizations are mobilizing in defense of this vision and the possibility of a new reality. 
This is the hope on the horizon. Since the NO vote, thousands have marched to support the peace process in Bogota, and also in Cali and cities across the country. The marches have awakened and united groups of indigenous peoples, Afro-Colombians, victims, students, human rights defenders, peasants, women, and the LGBT community in defense of peace. 
The international community should openly and actively support the call for a broad grassroots dialogue for peace. It must continue to be firm and vigilant, because there will be a serious attempt to force a return to the model of military annihilation of the left-wing guerrillas while leaving right-wing paramilitaries and other militarist structures intact. 
International organizations committed millions of dollars to support peace implementation, and it must be clear that those funds will only be released when the process is back on track. Part of creating adequate conditions is to deny any new funding to militarism ‚Äì including the war on drugs, which acts as a thinly veiled excuse for militarization. 
The NO vote unexpectedly flipped the political situation back in favor of the right-wing hawks. This uprising could not only flip it back in favor of peace, but also create a social movement capable of going beyond the accords in terms of establishing social justice and human rights and addressing the enormous backlog of demands from below.

How Hillary Clinton Poisoned American Politics,"How Hillary Clinton Poisoned American Politics Crazy conspiracy theories dominate the final days before Nov. 8 Share This 
FBI Director James Comey‚Äôs decision to reopen the investigation into Hillary Clinton‚Äôs mishandling of classified information has the Clintonites falling back on their tried-and-true response to all the revelations coming from WikiLeaks and other sources ‚Äì it‚Äôs all a Russian plot. Except, this time, the hysteria has reached such a fever pitch, and the conspiracy theories are so unhinged, that the political discourse in this country will be poisoned for years to come. 
It started with Rep. Tim Ryan (D-Ohio), who told CNN‚Äôs Wolf Blitzer: 
‚ÄúSo the question is: Where did these [emails] come from? How did they get to the FBI? Is Russia involved in this? We don‚Äôt have a clue where this stuff is coming from.‚Äù 
We don‚Äôt know if Ryan was drunk ( again ) when he said this, but his nickname of ‚Äú Congressman Moonbeam ‚Äù seems well-earned, and the implication of his remarks ‚Äì that the FBI is in league with the Russians ‚Äì underscores his marginality. However, it wasn‚Äôt long before the marginal started merging with the mainstream. In tandem with Rya, Howard Dean, former presidential candidate and once head of the Democratic party, tweeted : 
‚ÄúIronically, Comey put himself on the same side as Putin.‚Äù 
Now Dean may be a bit more credible than Ryan, but who can forget the ‚Äú Dean scream ‚Äù that dramatized his loonier side, and effectively knocked him out of contention for the Democratic presidential nomination? And then there were those payments from the Mujahideen-e-Khalq , a nutty Marxist-Islamist cult, in return for serving as their front man. And so while Dean may be better known, what he‚Äôs know for isn‚Äôt exactly adding to his credibility, and so we can safely relegate this kind of conspiracy theorizing to the fringes of the Democratic party spectrum. Right? 
Wrong. Here is longtime Clintonite strategist James Carville opining that ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs unprecedented ‚Ä¶ the House Republicans and the KGB are trying to influence our democracy.‚Äù Well, okay, who listens to Carville, anyway? He‚Äôs so yester day! Well, then, get a load of Harry Reid, who leads the Senate‚Äôs Democrats, repeating a different version of the same nonsense in a letter to Comey : 
""In my communications with you and other top officials in the national security community, it has become clear that you possess explosive information about close ties and coordination between Donald Trump, his top advisors, and the Russian government ‚Äì a foreign interest hostile to the united states, which Trump praises at every opportunity. The public has a right to know this information. I wrote to you months ago calling for this information to be released to the public. There is no danger to American interests from releasing it. And yet, you continue to resist calls to inform the public of this critical information."" 
It‚Äôs so ‚Äúexplosive‚Äù that it exploded into utter nothingness, according to the New York Times this [Tuesday] morning: 
‚ÄúFor much of the summer, the F.B.I. pursued a widening investigation into a Russian role in the American presidential campaign. Agents scrutinized advisers close to Donald J. Trump, looked for financial connections with Russian financial figures, searched for those involved in hacking the computers of Democrats, and even chased a lead ‚Äì which they ultimately came to doubt ‚Äì about a possible secret channel of email communication from the Trump Organization to a Russian bank. 
‚ÄúLaw enforcement officials say that none of the investigations so far have found any conclusive or direct link between Mr. Trump and the Russian government. And even the hacking into Democratic emails, FBI and intelligence officials now believe, was aimed at disrupting the presidential election rather than electing Mr. Trump.‚Äù 
As Gertrude Stein once put it, ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs no there there.‚Äù She was talking about Oakland, California, but might just as well have been describing the inside of Harry‚Äôs brain. 
And, yes, you read the above cited Times story right: instead of going after terrorists, or ordinary criminals, for months the FBI has been chasing down rabbit holes looking for Trump‚Äôs alleged links to the nonexistent International Kremlin/Alt-Right/Putinist Conspiracy. We have returned to the halcyon days of J. Edgar Hoover, when people were investigated and harassed for their political views at the instigation of their ideological opponents. 
Oh, but the FBI was too ‚Äú overburdened and undermanned ‚Äù to keep Omar Mateen on their radar. 
In this election, the tragic and the comic mix and merge, but surely the former is dominant in the latest of Franklin Foer‚Äôs Russophobic effusions. Formerly the editor of The New Republic , who was unceremoniously dumped by its new owner, Foer has teamed up with the Clinton campaign as its unofficial conspiracy theorist, spinning tales of Trump‚Äôs ‚Äúlinks‚Äù to the Russians. He‚Äôs the Alex Jones of the Clinton crowd, except that not even Jones would be caught dead promoting the kind of incoherent nonsense in Foer‚Äôs latest screed . 
According to Foer, Trump has a ‚Äúsecret server‚Äù set up specifically to communicate with his Kremlin Masters. We know this because a ‚Äúcomputer scientist‚Äù who wants to be known only as ‚ÄúTea Leaves,‚Äù and other ‚Äúexperts‚Äù ‚Äì who also don‚Äôt want to tell us their names ‚Äì have supposedly ‚Äúdiscovered‚Äù this Secret Link. The server connects to the Alfa Bank, which is located in ‚Äì cue in scary music ‚Äì Russia! And guess what!? This closed communication link was especially active during politically sensitive times! This, according to Foer and his anonymous band of ‚Äúexperts,‚Äù is conclusive proof that The Donald is a secret agent of the KGB, intent on polluting our precious bodily fluids with icky Russian cooties. 
The only problem with this wacky conspiracy theory is that there‚Äôs a prosaic explanation for the existence of this ‚Äúsuspicious‚Äù online traffic: the Trump Organization had hired a company to send out ads for their hotels. The online traffic to Alfa Bank meant only that several employees of that bank had stayed in Trump‚Äôs hotels and were being solicited to do so again. And in spite of the ‚Äúscientific‚Äù-looking chart displayed in the Foer piece, in fact the online traffic to and from Alfa didn‚Äôt ‚Äúpeak‚Äù when the US political scene got hot: ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs wrong,‚Äù writes Timothy B. Lee in the anti-Trump pro-Hillary Vox.com. ‚ÄúIf anything, the chart shows the opposite of that.‚Äù 
As Lee puts it: 
‚Äú Foer claims that the pattern of traffic between the Trump Organization and Alfa Bank servers is highly unusual ‚Äì so unusual that it can best be explained as a secretive communication link between Donald Trump and the Kremlin. 
‚ÄúBut in this case, there seems to be a plausible and perfectly innocent explanation for the traffic pattern suggested by an IT consultant named Naadir Jeewa and endorsed by security expert Robert Graham : The Trump organization is sending out promotional emails about Trump hotels, and one or more Alfa Bank employees is on the recipient list. 
‚ÄúThis is actually the explanation that‚Äôs suggested by Occam‚Äôs razor because ‚Äì as Foer himself acknowledges in his story ‚Äì the server was originally registered by an email marketing firm called Cendyn. The Trump organization seems to have hired Cendyn to send out emails promoting Trump‚Äôs hotels, a service Cendyn has been providing since the Trump server was registered in 2009. So the most obvious explanation for the traffic is that Cendyn is using its server for its intended purpose.‚Äù 
When Hillary Clinton‚Äôs Twitter account tweeted Foer‚Äôs farrago and declared ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs time for Trump to answer serious questions about his ties to Russia,‚Äù cyber-security expert Robert Graham replied on his blog : 
‚ÄúThis is nonsense. The evidence available on the Internet is that Trump neither (directly) controls the domain ""trump-email.com,"" nor has access to the server. Instead, the domain was setup and controlled by Cendyn, a company that does marketing/promotions for hotels, including many of Trump‚Äôs hotels. Cendyn outsources the email portions of its campaigns to a company called Listrak, which actually owns/operates the physical server in a data center in Philadelphia.‚Äù 
So the server wasn‚Äôt even owned by the Trump Organization . And yet it took the FBI months, and ‚Äújournalists,‚Äù including even The Intercept , ‚Äúweeks‚Äù to conclude that this story is completely bogus. The US taxpayers should demand their money back ‚Äì not to mention Pierre Omidyar . 
Even after this sloppy McCarthyite smear was debunked, the Clinton campaign breathlessly repeated the charges: ‚ÄúThis secret hotline may be the key to unlocking the mystery of Trump‚Äôs ties to Russia‚Äù! What this perfervid fantasy is the actually key to is the hysterical desperation of the Clinton campaign as it is engulfed in daily scandals that threaten to sink it beneath the electoral waves. 
Are you laughing ‚Äì or crying ‚Äì yet? Oh, but I‚Äôm not done! If you think this grade-B conspiracy theory is the lowest form of electoral entertainment, then you obviously haven‚Äôt read David Corn‚Äôs latest entry into the Smear Trump Sweepstakes. Glenn Greenwald ‚Äì no friend of Trump‚Äôs ‚Äì describes it as ‚Äúan unnamed person, from an unknown country, who used to work in an unnamed agency, claims Trump is a Russian agent.‚Äù How did the real estate mogul become a tool of the Kremlin? Well, you see, Trump once traveled to Russia, where he was suborned by one of those slinky-looking Russian ladies and ‚ÄúRussian intelligence had ‚Äòcompromised‚Äô Trump during his visits to Moscow and could ‚Äòblackmail him.‚Äô‚Äù 
Yes, they‚Äôre blackmailing Trump over a sexual indiscretion ‚Äì because that would destroy him for sure ! And it‚Äôs all in a ‚Äúsecret memo‚Äù that only Corn, the editors of Mother Jones , and their Mysterious Veteran Spook have seen. 
On one level, this is hysterically funny; it‚Äôs grade-C thriller material that is likely to be found at the bottom of some publisher‚Äôs slush pile. On another level ‚Äì the political level ‚Äì it is immensely depressingly significant ‚Äì because these people are ‚Äúliberals,‚Äù even ‚Äúleftists.‚Äù They aren‚Äôt stupid: they know the ignominious history of witch-hunting in this country. I‚Äôd call this McCarthyism ‚Äì but even Joe McCarthy had some actual evidence to back up his claims of ‚Äúforeign agents‚Äù lurking in the corridors of power. Corn, Foer, and the Clinton campaign are simply retailing lies. 
What‚Äôs depressing about this is the fact that, if Hillary wins, it isn‚Äôt going to stop. Far from it: the new ‚Äúred scare‚Äù will accelerate, as her political enemies are tarred with the ‚ÄúKGB agent‚Äù brush. And when the notoriously vindictive Democratic candidate takes revenge not only on her domestic political enemies, but on the Russians, an ugly ‚Äì and dangerous ‚Äì confrontation is in the cards. She‚Äôll sic the FBI on Trump‚Äôs supporters, and Trump himself, and she‚Äôll unleash the US military and our allies on Putin ‚Äì and then, watch out. 
That American liberalism has degenerated into a Russophobic, warmongering, witch-hunting ideology so quickly is one of the most astonishing ideological transformations in our political history. And all in the name of garnering partisan political advantage. As Donald Trump would put it: Sad!

Pentagon Seeks Another $6 Billion for Overseas Troop Deployments,"'Budget Amendment' for More Troops in Iraq, Afghanistan   
The Pentagon has announced it will file a ‚Äúbudget amendment‚Äù seeking another $6 billion in funding for the current fiscal year to pay for additional overseas troop deployments above and beyond what was already in the budget for this year. 
The $6 billion request comes as an ‚Äúurgent‚Äù request from the Pentagon, and would pay for additional ground troops in Iraq, the additional troops left in Afghanistan by stalling the drawdown, and to pay for escalated airstrikes around the world. 
Pentagon Comptroller Mike McCord says the hope is to get the White House to approve submitting the request to Congress before next week‚Äôs election, with an eye at getting it added to the latest emergency spending bill, expected before early December. 
These ‚Äúemergency‚Äù funding bills are the main way to get around spending caps, with Congress deliberately funding the Pentagon only for a portion of the year with money that, by the cap‚Äôs reckoning, was the whole year‚Äôs budget, then slipping ‚Äúemergency‚Äù bills in afterwards to pay for the rest of the year, while pretending the caps still exist.

"Russia Extends Aleppo Ceasefire Through Friday, Urges Rebels to Leave","Rebels: Leaving Aleppo 'Completely Out of the Question' by Jason Ditz, November 02, 2016 Share This 
Some two weeks after initially announcing what was going to be an eight hour ceasefire in Aleppo, Russia has continued to hold their fire, and today announced an extension of the operation through Friday , calling on the rebels to take the opportunity to withdraw from the city. 
While on the one hand this marks an extension of the ceasefire, the Friday deadline may amount to Russia‚Äôs government announcing an upcoming end to the pause. This comes a day after Russian officials warned the rebel offensives around Aleppo were jeopardizing the ceasefire, and a few days after Russian President Vladimir Putin rejected a call from the Defense Ministry to resume strikes. 
The rebels fighting in Aleppo have rejected Russia‚Äôs call to withdraw from the city by Friday evening as ‚Äú completely out of the question ,‚Äù insisting they intend to remain in the city to prevent allowing it to fall into the hands of the Russian military. 
Of course, Russia‚Äôs involvement has only been airstrikes in Aleppo, with the fighting on the ground all between the Nusra Front-led rebels and the Syrian military. The military has been seen to have a major advantage recently, though a rebel offensive over the weekend may have turned the tables, and is likely to reason why there is growing pressure from Russia‚Äôs Defense Ministry to resume the airstrikes. 
Russia has promised two corridors through which rebels can leave the city, and said they will allow them to take their weapons with them. The offer is similar to deals wherein rebel factions withdrew from small suburbs around Damascus, but of course on a much grander scale. That the rebels have already rejected it, however, suggests they believe they are not defeated yet. Last 5 posts by Jason Ditz",1
Defense Secretary: US Talking to Turkey About Future Role in Raqqa,"Insists ISIS Capital Will Be Attacked With 'Forces Available' by Jason Ditz, November 02, 2016 Share This 
Secretary of Defense Ash Carter today confirmed that negotiations with Turkey are ongoing related to the upcoming invasion of the Syrian city of Raqqa, the de facto capital city of ISIS. Carter suggested Turkey‚Äôs involvement would only happen ‚Äú further down the road .‚Äù 
The US announced that it intends to launch an invasion of Raqqa very soon, will conduct the operation concurrent with the ongoing invasion of Mosul in Iraq, and that Kurdish YPG forces will be providing the vast majority of the forces for this offensive. 
That‚Äôs irked Turkey, particularly the last part, as Turkish officials repeatedly warned the US against allowing Kurds anywhere near Raqqa and have suggested their own involvement was contingent on there being no Kurds involved. 
Carter‚Äôs comments suggest the US plan to invade without Turkey is unchanged, and that they intend to try to placate Turkey about the involvement of the YPG by giving them some involvement in the post-ISIS situation in Raqqa. Turkey is particularly keen to ensure that their own allies end up in control of Raqqa, and that‚Äôs likely the main incentive of this deal. Last 5 posts by Jason Ditz",1
Aid Agencies in Iraq Brace for Exodus as Civilians Flee Mosul,"First Civilians From Surrounding Towns Arrive in Camps   
Aid agencies which have been trying to prepare for the huge influx of displaced persons from the city of Mosul are reporting the first arrivals of civilians who fled the surrounding towns , most arriving on foot, and many with nothing more than the clothing on their backs. 
The agencies are playing up the months of preparation they engaged in, but exactly how they will cope with what could easily be a million new refugees with very little assistance from either the Iraqi government or from the US-led coalition, is still up in the air. 
The UN has reported six camps are ready to accept about 50,000 people, and 11 more camps are in the process of being readied. At the same time, the UN has warned that they don‚Äôt have the funding to support all of these refugees over the long run, and the Mosul battle looks to very much be the long run. 
Iraq has warned civilians in Mosul against fleeing from the city, a warning that came after the US announced they intend to conduct air strikes against fleeing ISIS fighters. It‚Äôs unclear how many civilians will be able to ‚Äústay put‚Äù as they were ordered, but the expectations of an intense urban battle are likely to drive many to flee while they still can.  ",1
Iraqi Elite Forces Stretched Thin by ISIS Tactics Around Mosul,"Bombings, Surprise Attacks Force 'Golden Division' to Spread Out   
Iraqi officials are never shy about talking up their military successes, and that has been especially true in the Mosul offensive, where they have regularly noted they are far ahead of schedule. The arrival of the first Iraqi troops into the outskirts of Mosul‚Äôs city limits was heralded as the start of the ‚Äútrue liberation.‚Äù 
Iraq‚Äôs most elite fighters, the so-called Golden Division, has talked up their high morale, bragging that ISIS forces seem to be in full retreat as soon as they see them. That may, however, be the plan for ISIS, with reports that the fast advances and staggered pockets of resistance are stretching the forces thin . 
ISIS is letting the Golden Division advance rapidly in some areas, and slowing their progress with IEDs and suicide car bombers in others. In some places, ISIS forces have hidden in tunnels and appeared behind the advancing troops. The Golden Division‚Äôs limited numbers have forced them to rely on the national police to hold territory that they have captured. 
This is a familiar strategy for ISIS forces, particularly in Iraq, where previous offensives and counter-offensives have seen them withdrawing from some areas and reinforcing others specifically to widen the front lines, forcing the other side to spread themselves around. 
And while there are a lot more troops attacking Mosul than in most previous cases, the number of actually well-trained, highly disciplined troops is relatively small. Indeed, Iraqi officials are already saying they are counting on local civilians to rise up against ISIS when they arrive, which has happened in some cases, but notably did not happen in other offensives against major cities, where the locals were more concerned with surviving in a warzone than convincing their ‚Äúliberators‚Äù of their loyalty.

Why Palestinians Want To Sue Britain: 99 Years Since the Balfour Declaration,"Share This 
Last July, the Palestinian Authority took the unexpected, although belated step of seeking Arab backing in suing Britain over the Balfour Declaration. That ""declaration"" was the first ever explicit commitment made by Britain, and the West in general, to establish a Jewish homeland atop an existing Palestinian homeland. 
It is too early to tell whether the Arab League would heed the Palestinian call , or if the PA would even follow through, especially considering that the latter has the habit of making too many proclamations backed by little or no action. 
However, it seems that the next year will witness a significant tug of war regarding the Balfour Declaration, the 100 th anniversary of which will be commemorated on November 02, 2017. 
But who is Balfour, what is the Balfour Declaration and why does all of this matters today? 
Britain‚Äôs Foreign Secretary from late 1916, Arthur James Balfour, had pledged Palestine to another people. That promise was made on November 02, 1917 on behalf of the British government in the form of a letter sent to the leader of the Jewish community in Britain, Walter Rothschild. 
At the time, Britain was not even in control of Palestine, which was still part of the Ottoman Empire. Either way, Palestine was never Balfour‚Äôs to so casually transfer to anyone else. His letter read: 
""His Majesty‚Äôs government view with favor the establishment in Palestine of a national home for the Jewish people, and will use their best endeavors to facilitate the achievement of this object, it being clearly understood that nothing shall be done which may prejudice the civil and religious rights of existing non-Jewish communities in Palestine, or the rights and political status enjoyed by Jews in any other country."" 
He concluded, ""I should be grateful if you would bring this declaration to the knowledge of the Zionist Federation."" 
Balfour was hardly acting on his own. True, the Declaration bears his name, yet, in reality, he was a loyal agent of an Empire with massive geopolitical designs, not only concerning Palestine alone, but with Palestine as part of a larger Arab landscape. 
Only a year earlier, another sinister document was introduced, albeit secretly. It was endorsed by another top British diplomat, Mark Sykes and, on behalf of France, by Fran√ßois Georges-Picot. The Russians were informed of the agreement, as they too had received a piece of the Ottoman cake. 
The document indicated that, once the Ottomans were soundly defeated, their territories, including Palestine, would be split among the prospective victorious parties. 
The Sykes-Picot Agreement , also known as the ""Asia Minor Agreement"", was signed in secret one hundred years ago, two years into World War I. It signified the brutal nature of colonial powers that rarely associated land and resources with people who lived upon or owned them. 
The centerpiece of the agreement was a map that was marked with straight lines by a China graph pencil. The map largely determined the fate of the Arabs, dividing them in accordance with various haphazard assumptions of tribal and sectarian lines. 
The improvised map consisted not only of lines but also colors , along with language that attested to the fact that the two countries viewed the Arab region purely on materialistic terms, without paying the slightest attention to the possible repercussions of slicing up entire civilizations with a multifarious history of cooperation and conflict. 
The Sykes-Picot negotiations were completed in March 1916 and, although official, was secretly signed on May 19, 1916. 
WWI concluded on November 11, 1918, after which the division of the Ottoman Empire began in earnest. 
British and French mandates were extended over divided Arab entities, while Palestine was granted to the Zionist movement a year later, when Balfour conveyed the British government‚Äôs promise, sealing the fate of Palestinians to a life of perpetual war and turmoil. 
Rarely was British-Western hypocrisy and complete disregard for the national aspiration of any other nation on full display as in the case of Palestine. Beginning with the first wave of Zionist Jewish migration to Palestine in 1882, European countries helped facilitate the movement of illegal settlers and resources, where the establishment of many colonies, large and small, was afoot. 
So when Balfour sent his letter to Rothschild, the idea of a Jewish homeland in Palestine was very much plausible. 
Still, many supercilious promises were being made to the Arabs during the Great War years, as the Arab leadership sided with the British in their war against the Ottoman Empire. Arabs were promised instant independence, including that of the Palestinians. 
When the intentions of the British and their rapport with the Zionists became too apparent, Palestinians rebelled , marking a rebellion that has never ceased 99 years later, and highlighting the horrific consequences of British colonialism and the eventual complete Zionist takeover of Palestine which is still felt after all of these years. 
Paltry attempts to pacify Palestinian anger were to no avail, especially after the League of Nations Council in July 1922 approved the terms of the British Mandate over Palestine ‚Äì which was originally granted to Britain in April 1920 ‚Äì without consulting the Palestinians at all. In fact, Palestinians would disappear from the British and international radar, only to reappear as negligible rioters, troublemakers, and obstacles to the joint British-Zionist colonial concoctions. 
Despite occasional assurances to the contrary, the British intention of ensuring the establishment of an exclusively Jewish state in Palestine was becoming clearer with time. The Balfour Declaration was not merely an aberration, but had, indeed, set the stage for the full-scale ethnic cleansing that followed, three decades later. 
In fact, that history remains in constant replay: the Zionists claimed Palestine and renamed it ""Israel""; the British continue to support them, although never ceasing to pay lip-service to the Arabs; and the Palestinian people remain a nation that is geographically fragmented between refugee camps, in the Diaspora, militarily occupied, or treated as second class citizens in a country upon which their ancestors dwelt since time immemorial. 
While Balfour cannot be blamed for all the misfortunates that have befallen Palestinians since he communicated his brief, but infamous letter, the notion that his ""promise"" embodied ‚Äì that of complete disregard of the aspirations and rights of the Palestinian Arab people ‚Äì that very letter is handed from one generation of British diplomats to the next, in the same way that Palestinian resistance to colonialism has and continues to spread across generations. 
That injustice continues, thus the perpetuation of the conflict. What the British, the early Zionists, the Americans and subsequent Israeli governments failed to understand, and continue to ignore at their own peril, is that there can be no peace without justice and equality in Palestine; and that Palestinians will continue to resist, as long as the reasons that inspired their rebellion nearly a century ago, remain in place.

North Korea‚Äôs Nuclear Ticket to Survival,"Share This 
In recent months, a number of U.S. officials have begun to reassess their understanding of why the North Korean government wants nuclear weapons. Rather than repeating the standard claim that the North Korean government is taking extreme measures to intimidate its enemies into making concessions, some officials have begun to suggest that the North Korean government desires nuclear weapons for defensive purposes. 
After the North Korean government conducted its fifth underground nuclear test on September 9, 2016, former US official Victor Cha presented the new line of thinking. ‚ÄúThis is not a cry for negotiations,‚Äù Cha told The New York Times . ‚ÄúThis is very clearly a serious effort at amassing real nuclear capabilities that they can use to deter the US and others.‚Äù 
A few days later, Cha shared the same logic with a subcommittee of the House Foreign Affairs Committee. ‚ÄúTesting was once interpreted by pundits to be an attention-getting effort for dialogue with the United States,‚Äù but ‚Äúit would be irresponsible today to adhere to such an interpretation,‚Äù Cha stated . In today‚Äôs world, ‚ÄúNorth Korea is executing a strategy designed to demonstrate a survivable nuclear deterrent before the next US administration comes into office.‚Äù In short, Cha insisted that the North Korean government sought to acquire nuclear weapons for the purpose of deterring its enemies. 
Threat or No Threat? 
Of course, not everyone in Washington agrees with such thinking. Although Cha and other strategic analysts have proposed that the North Korean government is rationally pursuing a nuclear deterrent to defend itself against the United States, high-level officials in Washington insist that nothing could be further from the truth. 
Notably, Secretary of State John Kerry has refuted the idea that the North Korean government needs to take defensive measures. For ‚Äúany person of common sense,‚Äù the answer to the question of whether the North Korean government has to defend itself against the United States is ‚Äúno,‚Äù Kerry announced on October 19, 2016. ‚ÄúEverybody knows that.‚Äù 
After making his point, Kerry then insisted that the United States posed no threat to North Korea because the US government has made no recent efforts to destroy the country. ‚ÄúThe United States has had the power to wipe out North Korea for years ‚Äì for years,‚Äù Kerry noted. ‚ÄúAnd if indeed that was our goal, we wouldn‚Äôt be sitting around waiting while they‚Äôre getting additional nuclear weapons.‚Äù 
Certainly, US officials have not recently attempted to wipe out North Korea. Although the United States had once destroyed most of North Korea during the Korean War, when it spent three years carpet-bombing the country and destroying most North Korean cities, US officials have not resorted to comparable tactics in the country since the armistice ended the fighting in 1953. 
At the same time, US officials have continued to take other actions to pressure, marginalize, and isolate North Korea. For starters, US officials have worked with their allies to impose restrictive sanctions on the country. Certainly, ‚Äúwe‚Äôre always looking at ways we can continue to apply pressure,‚Äù State Department Spokesperson Mark C. Toner acknowledged during a press briefing on July 19, 2016. In fact, ‚Äúthe sanctions are pretty severe right now.‚Äù 
Two months later, White House official Ben Rhodes made a similar point, only providing more emphasis. ‚ÄúSo we‚Äôve passed now through the U.N. Security Council the strongest sanctions ever on North Korea,‚Äù Rhodes stated . The sanctions are ‚Äúhaving an impact‚Äù and ‚Äúputting a tighter squeeze on North Korea.‚Äù 
To put an even tighter squeeze on North Korea, US officials have also made it clear that they are ready to take more direct action. Taking advantage of their extraordinary military power in the region, including the 28,500 US soldier s that are stationed in South Korea, US officials have continually reminded the North Korean government that they are ready to resume the Korean War at a moment‚Äôs notice. 
On the day that the North Korean government conducted its fifth underground nuclear test, Secretary of Defense Ashton Carter made the point by stating that ‚ÄúUS forces on the Korean Peninsula are always ready, and this is true every single day, to fight tonight.‚Äù 
A few days later, US officials then sent an even more powerful signal of their preparedness, flying two nuclear-capable B-1B bombers over South Korea in a display of military power. As US General Vincent K. Brooks explained at the time, US officials wanted to demonstrate their commitment to using their ‚Äúfull range of military capabilities,‚Äù such as nuclear weapons. 
Expect Serious Consequences 
By applying constant pressure to North Korea, US officials have sent another powerful message to the North Korean government. Although officials in Washington may deny that they are threatening North Korea, they have made it clear that the North Korean government can expect to face serious consequences for continuing to defy the United States with its nuclear weapons program. 
‚ÄúWhat I can tell you is our policy, with respect to North Korea‚Äôs provocations and the resolve of the United States and the international community to try to put adequate pressure on them to change their behavior, has not changed and remains the same,‚Äù State Department Spokesperson John Kirby confirmed on October 25, 2016. 
Even so, some officials are now providing another way of understanding the situation. On the same day that Kirby made his statement, Director of National Intelligence James Clapper indicated that the United States has ultimately left the North Korean government with no serious alternatives. ‚ÄúI think the notion of getting the North Koreans to denuclearize is probably a lost cause,‚Äù Clapper stated . ‚ÄúThey are not going to do that. That is their ticket to survival.‚Äù Indeed, Clapper indicated that the North Korean government would find it necessary to maintain a powerful nuclear arsenal in order to deter the constant threats it faces from the United States. 
‚ÄúAnd I got a good taste of that when I was there, about how the world looks from their vantage,‚Äù Clapper added. ‚ÄúAnd they are under siege and they are very paranoid.‚Äù 
In short, a number of US officials are now beginning to come to terms with one of the main reasons why the North Korean government is making such a major effort to acquire nuclear weapons. These officials are starting to believe that the North Korean government is working to build an arsenal of nuclear weapons to create a powerful deterrent against the United States.

Former NATO Chief: We Need US as ‚ÄòWorld‚Äôs Policeman‚Äô,"Complains Obama Isn't Hawkish Enough   
In a new interview with Britain‚Äôs Sky News, former NATO Secretary-General Anders Fogh Rasmussen brought out the old narrative of America as the ‚Äúworld‚Äôs policeman,‚Äù but with a lot more upbeat of an attitude about it than one would generally see. 
Rasmussen criticized President Obama for not being hawkish enough, saying his successor needs to be much more interventionist, and declaring ‚Äú we need America as the world‚Äôs policeman, ‚Äù adding that the US needs to ‚Äúrestore international law and order‚Äù through wars. 
Rasmussen, who was always a relative hawk in the post but seems to have taken it to an entirely new level, set out a series of things the US needs to fix militarily, including Iraq, Syria, Libya, Russia, China, and North Korea. This of course closely mirrors recent Pentagon talk of wars in the decades to come. 
The timing of his calls for extreme US bellicosity are centered on trying to influence the upcoming US election in favor of Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton, who has campaigned heavily on picking fights in Syria and against Russia. Rasmussen underscored this fact by declaring Donald Trump, who openly said the US cannot be the world‚Äôs police, as ‚Äúvery dangerous for the world.‚Äù  ",1
US Pledges $30 Million to Rebuild Ukraine‚Äôs Navy,"Navy Commander Says Fleet Will Counter Russia   
The host of one of Russia‚Äôs main fleets until the secession of Crimea, calling Ukraine‚Äôs own navy a mess would be an understatement. Built around aging Soviet hand-me-downs, the ships they did have largely defected along with Crimea. 
Indeed, while they have some small attack boats and the like, it would be fair to classify Ukraine‚Äôs entire ‚Äúnavy‚Äù as one ship, the Hetman Sahaydachnyy, their flagship, which is in the process of being repaired and refitted. Even this ship is just a frigate, but apart from coastal patrol boats and tug boats, it is what‚Äôs left. 
Ukrainian Navy Commander Vice Admiral Ihor Voronchenko is playing up the repairs and upgrades to their ship as the beginning of a major increase in capacity which will allow them to ‚Äúcounter Russia‚Äù in the Black Sea. The US is bankrolling part of this effort with $30 million in aid. 
By contrast, Russia‚Äôs Black Sea Fleet includes four Frigates, a guided missile destroyer, and an even larger guided missile cruiser, the Moskva, which is roughly four times the size of Ukraine‚Äôs ship. Beyond that, Russia has half a dozen submarines in the Black Sea, along with the usual smaller boats. 
NATO in general and the US in particular have talked up their desire to counter Russia‚Äôs Black Sea Fleet, but the Ukrainian Navy seems far from a realistic counter in and of itself, and the US funding appears primarily aimed at buying more influence with the Ukrainian government than at trying to develop their ship as a serious fighting force.

"Pakistan Recalls Diplomats From India, Threatens to Expel Indian Envoys","Accuses Indian Diplomats of Espionage Amid Growing Tensions   
On-again, off-again fighting between Indian and Pakistani forces in Kashmir looks to be spilling over into the diplomatic relationship between the two nations, as Pakistan has announced it will withdraw six staffers from their mission in New Dehli, and threaten to expel a number of Indian diplomats. 
The six staffers withdrawn include at least four diplomats, and Pakistani officials went on to accuse the five Indian diplomats of espionage , naming them in media reports and threatening to expel them from the country outright. 
This is a continuation of tit-for-tat expulsions which began last week, with both nations ordering a staffer out of the other‚Äôs embassy on espionage charges. The tensions are soaring with reports of heavy exchanges of fire in Kashmir over the weekend. 
India and Pakistan are never on the best of terms, but seem to get into these dust-ups once in awhile, usually around the Line of Control in Kashmir. The most recent fighting has been ongoing since August, and seems only to be getting worse as time goes on, raising concerns about a full-scale war between the two nuclear powers.  ",1

US Airstrikes Kill at Least 30 Afghan Civilians Around Kunduz,"Attack Was Meant to 'Defend' US Troops Under Fire by Jason Ditz, November 03, 2016 Share This 
Two US soldiers and four Afghan special forces were killed, and three other US soldiers wounded in heavy fighting with the Taliban this morning, as the Taliban attempted to surge into an area around the northern city of Kunduz. As they usually do, the troops called in airstrikes to ‚Äúbreak the siege.‚Äù 
Instead of breaking the siege, the US warplanes pounded the village of Bouz Kandahari, destroying a number of houses and killing at least 30 civilians . 25 further civilians were wounded in the attack, fueling protests outside the governor‚Äôs office in Kunduz. 
NATO conceded immediately that the coalition was behind the airstrikes, but appeared relatively unrepentant about it, insisting all the civilian deaths were because the Taliban were using the houses for ‚Äúcover,‚Äù which of course is not a legal justification for bombing the houses. 
US commander Gen. John Nicholson issued a statement after the incidents, offering condolences to the families of the two US soldiers who were slain. Defense Secretary Ash Carter also said he was ‚Äúsaddened‚Äù by the deaths of the US troops, but neither offered much of anything in comments on the dozens of dead civilians.

Assange Confirms: WikiLeaks Didn‚Äôt Get Emails From Russian Govt,"Accuses Clinton Campaign of 'Neo-McCarthyist Hysteria' by Jason Ditz, November 03, 2016 Share This 
In an interview with John Pilger, WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange has confirmed today that the organization did not get any of the hacked emails they published from the Russian government. WikiLeaks has a long-standing policy of not commenting on sources , so even such a denial is highly unusual. 
Assange insisted however that it was necessary to deny the claims, saying that Hillary Clinton‚Äôs camp ‚Äúhas been able to project a neo-McCarthyist hysteria‚Äù with false claims that Russia‚Äôs government in behind the hacked emails as part of a plot to rig next week‚Äôs election. 
Russia has long denied being involved in the hacking, but the Clinton campaign has run heavily on the issue, accusing Republican candidate Donald Trump of being a ‚Äúpuppet‚Äù of the Russian government, who they are trying to install by leaking embarrassing emails. 
The campaign‚Äôs allegations have so far been pretty effective at limiting media coverage of the content of the leaks, with a lot more attention going to the speculation that Russia is plotting to ‚Äúhack the vote‚Äù for Trump. Whether Assange‚Äôs straightforward denial is sufficient to bring the focus back to content remains to be seen, though the Democratic campaign is unlikely to give up what has been materially their main talking point over the past several months just because the facts don‚Äôt support it.

"Rebels Escalate Attacks on Western Aleppo, Killing 12 Civilians","Attacks Ramp Up Ahead of Russia's New Ceasefire by Jason Ditz, November 03, 2016 Share This 
A coalition of Syrian rebels led by the Nusra Front have been attacking government-held Western Aleppo since Friday, and escalated the strikes ahead of Russia‚Äôs new ceasefire. Reports out of the city suggest heavy firing against government-held neighborhoods. 
While details are still emerging, 12 civilians were reported slain in the firing, and around 200 others were wounded . This toll is independent of the toll from fighting on the ground between rebels and military forces, for which no official figures have yet been released. 
The Russian ceasefire is intended to offer a 10-hour window during which the rebels can leave the city freely through two corridors, taking their weapons and anything else with them, though the rebels have already denounced both the offer and the ceasefire, insisting they will never surrender the city. 
Both sides have been trading fire for months, often shelling one another‚Äôs neighborhoods, attacks which tend to kill a lot more civilian bystanders than combatants. They also trade offensives and counteroffensives, aiming to take control of the entire city. 
So far, neither side has been able to get serious gains in the fighting over the city. Some smaller gains by the Syrian military last month appear to be getting reversed with this new offensive by the rebels from outside the city. Last 5 posts by Jason Ditz",1

With the Nusra Front-led rebels in Aleppo still engaged in a major offensive against government forces in the western part of the city, they also found time to launch a whole separate offensive against another faction of rebels with which they used to be allied in the city. 
Nusra and its still remaining allies attacked and overran a number of positions belonging to the Fastaqim force, which like the other Nusra allies, is presented as ‚Äúmoderates‚Äù who are nominally aligned with the Free Syrian Army (FSA) as well as the al-Qaeda-linked Nusra. 
Fighting was reported to have ended and there are negotiations ongoing among the factions, though some reports suggest Fastaqim lost the majority of their positions and that a large chunk of their fighters have been detained, though the group‚Äôs leadership downplayed the losses. 
It‚Äôs unclear how significant the infighting will end up being in the context of ongoing fighting with government forces around Aleppo, though it certainly raises questions about the unity among the rebel coalition within the city, and whether the larger forces are going to turn on any other smaller allies in the meantime.

Iraq PM Threatens War Over Turkey‚Äôs Military Buildup,"Says Iraq Will Deal With Turkey 'As an Enemy' by Jason Ditz, November 03, 2016 Share This 
In comments broadcast on Iraqi state television, Prime Minister Hayder Abadi confirmed that his nation is ‚Äúready‚Äù for a full-scale military confrontation with neighboring Turkey, insisting Iraq doesn‚Äôt necessarily want war, but is prepared to deal with Turkey ‚Äúas an enemy.‚Äù 
The comments come just over a day after Turkey began massing tanks and artillery along the Iraqi border, which Turkish defense officials insisted were simply aimed to prepare for potential ‚Äú developments in the region .‚Äù 
The two nations have had testy relations for over a year, however, related to a number of Turkish ground troops deployed in Iraq without Abadi‚Äôs permission, and their refusal to leave. Turkish President Erdogan has claimed Turkey retains an interest in Mosul, whose loss to a League of Nations ruling in the 1920s they don‚Äôt recognize, and Erdogan has also warned that Abadi and the Iraqi government are not ‚Äúat his level‚Äù where they can speak to him as an equal on the matter. 
The US has been trying to keep the two nations at least civil for the sake of the Mosul invasion, but claims by Pentagon officials that the two had an agreement in principle to work together clearly never panned out, and tensions are still on the rise. Last 5 posts by Jason Ditz",1
"ISIS Leader Confident in Mosul Defense, Rules Out Retreat","Pentagon Claims Comments Prove Baghdadi Losing Control by Jason Ditz, November 03, 2016 Share This 
In a newly released audio recording, ISIS leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi expressed confidence that his forces would succeed in defending Mosul from an ongoing offensive by what he referred to as ‚Äúenemies of God.,‚Äù saying he is convinced this is the prelude to victory. 
Mosul is ISIS‚Äô largest city, with the metro area home to about 1.5 million people. It is their last major city within Iraqi territory, and the US has presented their imminent defeat in the city as spelling the effective end to the ISIS caliphate. 
Baghdadi insisted there could be no surrender in the fight, a statement which is literally true since the US has insisted they intend to kill every ISIS fighter who attempts to flee the city with airstrikes Baghdadi suggested there would be retaliatory suicide attacks abroad that would wreak havoc on ‚Äúunbelievers,‚Äù and ‚Äúmake their blood flow as rivers.‚Äù 
The Pentagon, always upbeat about wars everywhere, said Baghdadi‚Äôs confident statement proved he is losing control of ISIS in general, and that he was desperately trying to prevent infighting, adding ‚Äúwe don‚Äôt believe it is going to work.‚Äù Last 5 posts by Jason Ditz",1
Ron Paul on ISIS: Mortal Threat or Paper Tiger?,"If ISIS is such a mortal threat to the United States, why has US military action in Iraq and Syria been proceeding at such a leisurely pace?

Syrian Kurds Warn US: Turkey Can‚Äôt Be Involved in Raqqa Invasion,"Insists SDF the 'Only Force' That Will Invade the ISIS Capital by Jason Ditz, November 03, 2016 Share This 
A new statement from the Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF), a faction which is dominated by the Kurdish YPG, has affirmed that not only will they be participating in the invasion of the ISIS capital city of Raqqa, as previously announced by the US, but that they intend to be the ‚Äú only force that will take part in the operation .‚Äù 
Even more noteworthy, since the Turkish government has over the past two months repeatedly publicly warned the US that the Kurds mustn‚Äôt be allowed to participate in the Raqqa operation at all, the SDF‚Äôs statement offered its own warning to the US that Turkey can‚Äôt have any role. 
Turkey‚Äôs military and its allied rebel factions have been invading northern Syria for some time now, mostly fighting ISIS as well, but Turkish warplanes have repeatedly attacked Kurdish YPG forces as well, mostly notably a few weeks ago when they launched strikes against YPG forces who were engaged in an offensive against ISIS at the time. 
It is unsurprising, then, that neither side is comfortable working with the other in offensives, but still raises the possibility of the two getting into direct combat over who gets to attack Raqqa. This is particularly true since Turkey is still resenting their exclusion from Iraq‚Äôs invasion of Mosul. Last 5 posts by Jason Ditz",1
Report: Saudis Quietly Backing UN Peace Plan for Yemen,"Sources Claim 'Most' of Saudi Leadership Endorses Plan by Jason Ditz, November 03, 2016 Share This 
The UN peace plan for Yemen, which involves the creation of an interim unity government, appeared dead on arrival when it was endorsed by the Shi‚Äôite Houthis as a promising start, but immediately condemned by the Saudi-backed Hadi government. New reports, however, suggest the Saudis may be breathing new life into the matter. 
Publicly, the Saudi government has not commented on the plan yet, but those familiar with the situation say that most if not all of the leadership supports the plan , and that they‚Äôve been quietly pushing Hadi in the direction of allowing it as a basis for peace talks. 
The plan would allow Hadi to hold a nominal leadership position, but insists it would be entirely a figurehead position with little to no real power. Hadi became Yemen‚Äôs president in 2012 in a one candidate vote, and unilaterally extended his two-year term in office beyond that date. 
The United Arab Emirates has already publicly backed the peace deal, becoming the first member of the Saudi coalition to do so. Saudi Arabia attacked Yemen in March of 2015, vowing to reinstall Hadi as president after he resigned two months prior. The ongoing war has caused growing international outcry, however, and there is more pressure to resolve the situation. Last 5 posts by Jason Ditz",1
Pentagon: No Plan ‚ÄòSo Far‚Äô For US Troops to Enter Mosul,"Officials Concede Plan Could Change, as Could Definition of 'Mosul' by Jason Ditz, November 03, 2016 Share This 
The US has made much of its troops involved in the Mosul invasion not being ‚Äúcombat‚Äù troops, even though one of the troops was killed in a roadside bombing while embedded with Kurdish combat troops. As the troops near Mosul, however, Pentagon spokesman Col. John Dorrian insists there are no plans so far for troops to enter Mosul. 
Col. Dorrian insisted that Iraq‚Äôs government has said ‚Äúit‚Äôs just gonna be their forces.‚Äù He did, however, say he didn‚Äôt want to say US troops would ‚Äúnever‚Äù be involved, insisting that the plans could change at any time. 
Other officials, quoted anonymously by Reuters , suggested that the definition of Mosul could also change, saying that suburbs and parts of the city‚Äôs outskirts could easily be redefined as not Mosul, allowing US troops to enter those areas without having to technically ‚Äúenter Mosul.‚Äù 
The Obama Administration initially promised ‚Äúno boots on the ground‚Äù in Iraq, but with some 6,000 such troops in Iraq, they‚Äôve seen been trying desperately to claim they are in ‚Äúnon-combat‚Äù roles. This too has been difficult to sell, with a number of those troops embedded in combat units. Those troops are nominally ‚Äúadvisers,‚Äù but are regularly being put into combat areas.

Jordan Troops Kill Three US Military Trainers at Air Base,"Jordan Claims US Vehicle 'Failed to Stop' at Gate by Jason Ditz, November 04, 2016 Share This 
Three US soldiers assigned to a training operation in Jordan were killed today by Jordanian troops at the al-Jafr Air Base, when base security opened fire on them near the gate. One Jordanian soldier was also reported wounded in the incident. 
Unlike other recent incidents of US soldiers killed by allies, this incident was not chalked up to infiltration by rogue elements. Rather, Jordanian officials blamed the US soldiers, claiming their vehicle failed to stop at the gate to the air base and security reacted. 
The Pentagon was a little less cut and dry on the matter, saying they can‚Äôt say for sure if it was a ‚Äúdeliberate‚Äù attempt to kill US soldiers or some sort of misunderstanding. They say they are working with the Jordanian government to gather more details. 
US trainers in Jordan are there to train Syrian rebels, an operation which has been ongoing for years. Last year in November, two US contractors were killed in another incident in which a police officer opened fire on them. Last 5 posts by Jason Ditz",1
"US Threatens Military Hacks on Russia‚Äôs Electric, Communications Grids Over Election","Pentagon Preparing for Massive Election Day Hacking Offensive by Jason Ditz, November 04, 2016 Share This 
This US has publicly threatened ‚Äòretaliatory‚Äô hacks against Russia for weeks now, based on allegations that Russia may have been involved in certain hacks related to Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton. Russia denied involvement and the US government has been unable to produce any concrete evidence of Russian involvement. 
Vice President Joe Biden went so far as to confirm the US had informed Vladimir Putin that the US would conduct revenge attacks ‚Äúat the time of our choosing.‚Äù The time may ultimately be America‚Äôs election day, according to officials familiar with the situation. 
NBC News has reported seeing top secret documents from these officials detailing potential US plans to launch military cyber attacks against Russia‚Äôs civilian infrastructure, with the documents claiming advanced US cyber weapons were prepared to take down Russia‚Äôs entire electricity grid, all telecommunications networks, and the Kremlin‚Äôs own command systems. 
The reports are emerging in the context of US officials speculating that Russia might launch cyber attacks against the US during the election to try to disrupt it. Since they offered no evidence for this either, it raises concerns that the US is simply setting up a pretext for timing its own attacks around them. 
That officials are trying to assure the media that such huge attacks would only be launched in retaliation offers little comfort, given the administration‚Äôs willingness to claim anything and everything remotely election-related and embarrassing to the Clinton campaign as a Russian plot. 
Such massive US attacks on Russian infrastructure, regardless of the pretext, would likely be seen as an act of war. The US has made clear in the past they would regard cyber attacks of a large enough scale as equivalent to conventional military attacks, and given the scale that it being discussed it‚Äôs hard to imagine Russia would not react similarly.

"UN Report: Around 45,000 Opposition Fighters in Afghanistan","About 25% of the Fighters Are Foreigners by Jason Ditz, November 04, 2016 Share This 
A new report being circulated by the United Nations reveals a growing number of opposition fighters in Afghanistan, some 15 years after the initial US-led invasion and occupation of the country, with the most recent estimates suggesting about 45,000 opposition fighters present in the country . 
While these figures are generally dominated by the Taliban insurgency, it also includes a significant ISIS affiliate in the country, along with al-Qaeda supporters and others simply described by the UN as ‚Äúbad actors.‚Äù An estimated 20-25% of the fighters are foreigners. 
The opposition fighter figure is never exactly a clear number, but the trend has definitely been toward growth , with NATO estimates of 25,000 to 30,000 in 2010 growing to 35,000 by mid-2012. The foreign fighters in the country are a significant factor, including a large number of Pakistanis and Uzbeks. 
This growth is in spite of ever-increasing efforts to control the Afghan-Pakistan border, as well as claims of massive death tolls by the Afghan government in attacks against both Taliban and ISIS forces. 
The increase in opposition fighters makes sense, however, in the context of the growing percentage of the country under opposition control, with recent reports suggesting that only 63.4% of Afghanistan can rightly be called under control anymore. Last 5 posts by Jason Ditz",1
US Officials Try to Scare Voters With Terror Threat,"US Intelligence Sees Attacks Likely Ahead of Tuesday Vote by Jason Ditz, November 04, 2016 Share This 
US intelligence officials have reportedly warned law enforcement around the country of the potential for multiple al-Qaeda terrorist attacks on Monday, aimed to coincide with the day before the US election. The reports were described as ‚Äú possibly legitimate and concerning. ‚Äù 
Details are still scant, but the intelligence has singled out New York, Virginia, and Texas as the mostly likely targets. Even then, they offered no details on potential locations, saying al-Qaeda and its affiliates are eager to regain their relevance. 
A NYPD spokesman briefed on the matter said that the threats ‚Äú lack specificity ,‚Äù however local police around the country were said to have been warned that polling places are considered ‚Äúattractive targets‚Äù for both organized and homegrown terror attacks. 
Of course, saying that any upcoming event is a potential ‚Äúattractive target‚Äù is not unusual these days, and hardly a significant holiday goes by in the US where warnings and briefings about potential attacks are not heavily publicized. 
The Monday warning offers some unusual details, however, as generally one would think the day of the election itself would be the target, when more people are queuing up for the vote. An attack the day before the election would, however, cast a rather dramatic pall over the entire matter. Last 5 posts by Jason Ditz",1
"As Iraqi Troops Near Mosul, Civilian Casualties Begin to Rise","Locals Caught in Crossfire Between Troops, ISIS   
While early fighting in Mosul was presented as comparatively easy by Iraqi officials, as the troops near the city, the fighting is starting to get more fierce, and the civilian population trapped in the area is increasingly caught in the crossfire . 
Increased fighting, and higher population density are a dangerous combination, and locals by and large are being prevented from fleeing the area. Unsurprisingly, this is leading to reports of a growing number of civilians killed and wounded in the area. 
This has the PR people going into high gear, trying to manage the narrative around the deaths, with Western and Iraq officials accusing ISIS of forcing civilians into the city to use as human shields, and preventing them from relocating outside the city. 
While some reports suggest this may be accurate, the US has also talked openly of conducting airstrikes against all ‚Äúfighters‚Äù fleeing the city, which has led the Iraqi government to openly warn the civilian population of Mosul against fleeing , lest they get targeted as welll. 
Civilians getting mistaken for fleeing ISIS fighters has been an ongoing problem for the US, who killed hundreds of civilians around the Syrian city of Manbij in such mistakes. Manbij was a much smaller city than Mosul, which has a population of over a million people potentially in the line of fire.  ",1
Angry Mourners Bury Civilian Victims of US Airstrike in North Afghanistan,"Afghan Officials Say Taliban Used Locals as 'Human Shields'   
Hundreds of angry mourners gathered today in the north Afghan village of Bouz Kandahari to bury an estimated 30 civilian victims of a US airstrike the previous day. The locals noted that many of the civilians being buried were infants and small children. 
Two US soldiers and four Afghan soldiers were killed in fighting with the Taliban near the village Thursday morning, and the airstrikes were called in, supposedly in an attempt to break the Taliban siege against the village. Instead, the airstrikes hit the village, destroying several homes and killing those within. 
NATO promised an investigation into the details of the matter, but Afghan officials appeared to be shrugging the matter off, insisting the Taliban were using the locals as ‚Äúhuman shields‚Äù by virtue of their operating somewhat near their homes. 
US statements on the fighting and airstrikes have more or less ignored the civilian toll entirely, insisting only that they take such reports ‚Äúseriously,‚Äù and then going into details about the condolences they offer for the US soldiers killed in the fighting. 
Bouz Kandahari is near the city of Kunduz, which was taken over briefly last year by the Taliban. The Taliban has been advancing in the area in recent weeks, along with offensives against the capitals of two other provinces, Helmand and Uruzgan.  ",1

CLINTON CAMPAIGN CHAIRMAN HAD MULTIPLE DINNERS WITH TOP DOJ OFFICIAL DURING HILLARY'S EMAIL INVESTIGATION,"Email 

The day after Hillary Clinton testified in front of the House Select Committee on Benghazi last October, John Podesta, the Democrat‚Äôs campaign chairman, met for dinner with a small group of well-connected friends, including Peter Kadzik, a top official at the Justice Department. 
The dinner arrangement, revealed in hacked Podesta emails released by Wikileaks, is just the latest example of an apparent conflict of interest between the Clinton campaign and the federal agency charged with investigating the former secretary of state‚Äôs email practices. 
Podesta and Kadzik, the assistant attorney general for legislative affairs, were in frequent contact, other emails show. In one email from January, Kadzik and Podesta, who were classmates at Georgetown Law School in the 1970s, discussed plans to celebrate Podesta‚Äôs birthday. And in another sent last May, Kadzik‚Äôs son emailed Podesta asking for a job on the Clinton campaign.

Hillary has built the biggest big-money operation ever,"Email 

BEVERLY HILLS, Calif. ‚Äî More than 100 of Hillary Clinton‚Äôs biggest donors crowded into the home of Casey and Laura Wasserman here on Thursday night, each having written a check for at least $33,400 to snag a ticket. The Hollywood glitterati in attendance ‚Äî Elton John performed on the piano; Barbra Streisand mingled in the crowd ‚Äî were sending her off for the home stretch of the campaign with north of $5 million in fresh funding. 
It was a fitting capstone to a remarkable 18 months for Clinton on the lucrative California fundraising circuit, this final event anchored by a host committee of billionaires, Hollywood executives, media moguls and tech investors ‚Äî Sean Parker, Jeffrey Katzenberg, Haim Saban, Chris Sacca ‚Äî that each directed $416,000 to Clinton‚Äôs efforts. 
Clinton calls them her ‚ÄúHillblazers,‚Äù campaign bundlers who have given or raised at least $100,000 for her campaign. And she has erected an unparalleled and unprecedented infrastructure of 1,133 such people ‚Äî nearly double the number of any past presidential candidate, including President Obama four years ago. 
While Clinton and her advisers like to tout her small online donors, it is these bundlers in more than 40 states and four foreign countries who form the true backbone of her financial operation. Combined, this elite $100,000-and-up club has amassed a minimum of $113 million for Clinton and the Democratic Party ‚Äî and the actual figure is likely far, far higher than that. (The biggest bundlers typically collect millions for campaigns.) 
‚ÄúWe had the best base of donors and bundlers and raisers ever in 2008. It was even better in 2012. And it‚Äôs much better in 2016 than 2012,‚Äù said Wade Randlett, a San Francisco-based Democrat who has raised money for Clinton, Obama and Democratic causes for decades. ‚ÄúThe Obama people basically 100 percent in are favor of Hillary. There‚Äôs really no loss because of ideology or bad blood. And she has added an enormous number of people, especially women.‚Äù 
Among her bundlers are celebrities (Will Smith) and sports stars (Earvin ‚ÄúMagic‚Äù Johnson), Hollywood directors (Steven Spielberg and George Lucas) and corporate executives (Marissa Mayer and Sheryl Sandberg), Wall Street-types (Marc Lasry), media executives (Haim Saban and Anna Wintour) and members of Congress, including her running mate, Sen. Tim Kaine, who helped raise more than $100,000 for Clinton before he joined the ticket in July. 
The Clinton campaign said 45 percent of its bundlers are women. 
There are also federal lobbyists, from whom the Democratic Party under Obama refused to accept money, a prohibition that has since been rolled back. 
This club has expanded to the point where Clinton would now struggle to fit all of these bundlers into a single ballroom. As of the end of June, she counted 496 such individuals and couples. By the end of July, it was 871. On August 31, it was 1,133. 
It includes billionaires George Soros, Warren Buffett and Tom Steyer, super lobbyists like Steve Elmendorf and bold-faced names like Calvin Klein and J.J. Abrams. There is also a sprinkling of longtime Clinton family advisers, such as Vernon Jordan.",1

It appears that Abedin wasn‚Äôt the only person concerned about Hillary‚Äôs health.

Palmieri responded, ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt know.‚Äù 
A post at Heat Street observed: 
Hillary Clinton suffered a ‚Äúcracked head‚Äù (her words) after suffering a fall in December 2012. Many have speculated about her health since that episode, and questions grew louder in September of this year when Hillary was caught on tape nearly collapsing at a 9/11 memorial event in Manhattan. 
After initially blaming the health scare on ‚Äúdehydration,‚Äù the campaign was forced to acknowledge the candidate had been diagnosed with pneumonia. 
‚ÄúIt was unclear whether Abedin was referring to a serious ailment,‚Äù the New York Post added. 
In January 2016, Breitbart reported: 
Democrat frontrunner Hillary Clinton‚Äôs disappearance from the debate stage last month left people speculating that the former First Lady took a long bathroom break, but now a law-enforcement source with inside connections is alleging that Clinton was missing from the stage due to health issues stemming from a previous brain injury. 
These long-lasting symptoms stemming from a concussion and blood clot, according to a neurologist, suggest Clinton is suffering from post-concussion syndrome, which can severely impact her cognitive abilities.

TRUMP CUTS OFF FUNDRAISING EVENTS FOR REPUBLICAN PARTY,"Email 

Donald Trump‚Äôs campaign has ended fundraising events meant to support the Republican Party‚Äôs get-out-the-vote efforts in next month‚Äôs elections. 
Aides to the Republican nominee told Fox News that Trump Victory, the joint fundraising committee for the GOP and the campaign, held its most recent fundraiser on Oct. 19 and no more such events were scheduled. 
The move, which was first reported by The Washington Post, cuts off a key money source for Republicans hoping to keep hold of both houses of Congress. 
‚ÄúWe‚Äôve kind of wound down,‚Äù Trump national finance chairman Steven Mnuchin told the Post. ‚ÄúBut the online fundraising continues to be strong.‚Äù 
By contrast, the Post reported that Democrat Hillary Clinton‚Äôs campaign has scheduled 41 fundraising events between now and Nov. 4. The former secretary of state was scheduled to make her last personal fundraising appearance Tuesday in Miami. 
Mnuchin told the paper that the real estate mogul was focusing on making his final pitch to the voters at a campaign events rather than raising money in the final two weeks of the race. 
‚ÄúWe have minimized his fundraising schedule over the last month to emphasize his focus on political [events],‚Äù Mnuchin said of the candidate. ‚ÄúUnlike Hillary, who has been fundraising and not out and about, he has constantly been out and about.‚Äù

When Breitbart News‚Äô Washington political editor, Matthew Boyle, confronted Mook about Creamer and his firm in the spin room after the third presidential debate, Mook claimed: ‚ÄúThey‚Äôve never worked for our campaign.‚Äù When asked if Clinton had ever discussed the controversial political operations with Creamer directly, Mook replied: ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt think so.‚Äù 
Now, however, O‚ÄôKeefe and Project Veritas have released video of Creamer claiming that Clinton directly approved one of his more bizarre plans ‚Äî an effort to attract media attention and incite violence by dressing an activist in a Donald Duck costume and sending that activist into Trump events, emphasizing the argument that Trump was ‚Äúducking‚Äù releasing his tax returns. 
The action, if true, would be a black-letter violation of federal election law, which prohibits presidential campaigns from coordinating activities with outside groups that can collect unlimited ‚Äòdark money‚Äô from contributors ‚Äì and don‚Äôt pay taxes on what they collect.

Hillary Friend Bribed FBI Agent and His Wife,"Email 

WSJ The political organization of Virginia Gov. Terry McAuliffe, an influential Democrat with longstanding ties to Bill and Hillary Clinton, gave nearly $500,000 to the election campaign of the wife of an official at the Federal Bureau of Investigation who later helped oversee the investigation into Mrs. Clinton‚Äôs email use. 
Campaign finance records show Mr. McAuliffe‚Äôs political-action committee donated $467,500 to the 2015 state Senate campaign of Dr. Jill McCabe, who is married to Andrew McCabe, now the deputy director of the FBI. 
The Virginia Democratic Party, over which Mr. McAuliffe exerts considerable control, donated an additional $207,788 worth of support to Dr. McCabe‚Äôs campaign in the form of mailers, according to the records. That adds up to slightly more than $675,000 to her candidacy from entities either directly under Mr. McAuliffe‚Äôs control or strongly influenced by him.

Arab Prince Who Gave Hillary $50 Million Begs Americans Not to Vote for Trump,"Email 

A Saudi prince has urged Americans not to vote for Donald Trump in the upcoming general election. He practically beggs the people to give their votes for Hillary Clinton. For us, this is a HUGE reason NOT TO VOTE FOR HILLARY! She got $50 million from this man. I guess you know what am I talking about. Do not let their cooperation continue, because it is going to end up bad for America. Lets choose a true patriot and see where would our country go! I am sure it is going to be much better than crooked Hillary‚Äôs road. 
Turki al-Faisal, who served as Saudia Arabia‚Äôs ambassador to the US from 2005 to 2007, spoke against the presumptive Republican nominee during a foreign policy dinner in Washington, DC on Thursday. 
He blasted Trump‚Äôs proposal to ban Muslims from entering the US, which the billionaire first formulated in December last year before renewing his vow on Wednesday. 
‚ÄòFor the life of me, I cannot believe that a country like the United States can afford to have someone as president who simply says, ‚ÄúThese people are not going to be allowed to come to the United States,‚Äù‚Äô Turki said according to the Huffington Post. 
‚ÄòIt‚Äôs up to you, it‚Äôs not up to me,‚Äô Turki added. ‚ÄòI just hope you, as American citizens, will make the right choice in November.‚Äô 
The gulf nations represent three of the largest donors to the foundation, but that is hardly the extent of their ties to the Clintons. Qatari, UAE, and Saudi firms paid Bill Clinton millions of dollars for speeches during the time Hillary served as secretary of state, when she also approved weapons deals with all three countries worth billions of dollars to U.S. defense firms, many of which are also Clinton Foundation donors. 
Bill Clinton has praised the Qataris as ‚Äúintelligent, forward looking‚Äù investment partners for their collaboration on Clinton Foundation projects. One of Hillary‚Äôs top advisers, Cheryl Mills, served on the board of the New York 
University campus in Abu Dhabi. Bill Clinton is the friend and former classmate of Saudi Prince Turki bin Faisal Al Saud, who recently attended a lavish Clinton Foundation conference in Marrakech, hosted by the King of Morocco. The Bill Clinton presidential library in Little Rock was funded in part by a $10 million from the Saudi Royal family.

UK training Saudi pilots amid reports of war crimes in Yemen,"Email Britain has been providing military training to the Saudi Arabian Air Force, while the country is carrying out atrocities in neighboring Yemen, a report says. The UK's Liberal Democrats revealed that the British government is providing the training in both Saudi Arabia and Britain itself, The Independent revealed on Saturday. The party‚Äôs Foreign Affairs spokesman, Tom Brake, obtained a parliamentary letter from UK Defense Secretary Michael Fallon, in which he acknowledged that the British government provides the training to Saudi pilots bombing civilians in Yemen. Brake denounced the move as ‚Äúshameful,‚Äù calling on the Ministry of Defense to end the training immediately. ‚ÄúThe Government must end its complicity in this murderous campaign,‚Äù he said. ""It is shameful that the UK government is not only arming Saudi pilots, it is training them as well.‚Äù Saudi Arabia has launched a war in Yemen on March 26, 2015, in a bid to undermine the HouthiAnsarullah movement and restore power to Saudi-backed former president AbdRabbuh Mansur Hadi. Since the beginning of the aggression, almost 10,000 people, including over 2,000 children, have been killed. The Liberal Democrats also wanted to know what the instructions and advice had been given by the British government on authorizing military operations and the ‚Äútargeting of aerial operations‚Äù over the last year. ""The indiscriminate bombing of innocent civilians by Saudi Arabia in Yemen, in clear breach of international humanitarian law, is now well documented,‚Äù Blake added. In response, Fallon claimed the government helps the Saudi Air Force in order to ‚Äúimprove their targeting processes and to support International Humanitarian Law (IHL) compliance.‚Äù Fallon said the UK had delivered two training sessions in Saudi Arabia on the process for investigating alleged International Humanitarian Law violations, under a joint incident team it supported. He, however, said that the government ‚Äúhas not provided any specific operational advice to the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia for operations in Yemen and has not provided training on political authorization of military operations.‚Äù The Liberal Democrat party also insisted that the latest revelation requires an urgent action by UK Foreign Secretary Boris Jonson, who personally signs off any arms sales to countries such as Saudi Arabia. London, which has been one of the biggest suppliers of weapons to Riyadh for 40 years, has come under fire for its continued sales of weapons to the kingdom during its war on Yemen. Charity group Oxfam accused the British government of being in a state of ‚Äúdenial and disarray‚Äù over its arms supplies to Riyadh. Earlier this year, Amnesty International found a banned British-made cluster bomb used by the Saudis in Yemen. The un-detonated bomb which was found in a remote village in northern Yemen was BL-755 cluster bombs.",1

Busted: Bill Recorded Telling Mistress To Deny That Clintons Helped Her Get A State Job,"Email 

Former President Bill Clinton can be heard telling his former mistress, Gennifer Flowers, to deny that he helped her get a state job in a series of recorded phone conversation from 1991. 
‚ÄúIf they ever asked if you‚Äôd talked to me about it, you can say no,‚Äù Clinton is heard saying in the recording. 
At the time, the media was making inquiries about Flowers‚Äô alleged affair with Clinton, and she was concerned that they may question how she got a job as administrative assistant for the Arkansas Appeal Tribunal. 
Clinton can also be heard telling Flowers how to handle a grievance filed by soemone else who applied for the same positioned and claimed she was more qualified than Flowers. 
Flowers famously recorded a series of conversation she had with Clinton from December 1990 to December 1991, while he was still Governor of Arkansas. The audio segments about the state job were widely reported in the 1990‚Äôs, however, as other pay-for-play financial scandals have surfaced, the details may warrant revisiting. 

Here is a transcript of part of the recording: 
GF ‚Äì But anyway, then Wednesday, there was a grievance filed in my office when I got the job by a girl who felt like she should have gotten it, a black girl named (deleted). And they called me as a witness. So I go in and uh, nothing big came of it. It‚Äôs just that they were questioning me about how I found out about the job. And I said, ‚ÄúWell, that personnel said it that it was a possibility there would be a position,‚Äù and then uh, ‚Äúthey told me that it would be advertised in the newspaper. And it was and I pursued it from there. 
BC ‚Äì Good for you. 
GF: Yeah. We had a little bit of a scare recently because she had a spot on an X-ray. And she went and had it checked again and it wasn‚Äôt cancer. And it‚Äôs been almost, it‚Äôll be two years in May that she‚Äôs now diagnosed cancer free. My stepfather has been through two angioplasties, but he‚Äôs doing good. And I am, I‚Äôm really, Bill what I‚Äôm afraid of is that if somebody in the press finds out that I‚Äôm working for the state. 
BC ‚Äì Yeah. 
GF ‚Äì They‚Äôre going to make a big deal of it. 
BC ‚Äì Yeah. 
GF ‚Äì Well the only thing that concerns me, where I‚Äôm, where I‚Äôm concerned at this point is the state job. 
BC ‚Äì Yeah. I never thought about that, but as long as you say you‚Äôve just been looking for one, you‚Äôd uh, check on it. If they ever asked if you‚Äôd talked to me about it, you can say no.",1
Tim Kaine: ‚ÄúThe Catholic Church Will Change Its Same-Sex Marriage Stance Or It Will Be Banned From The U.S.‚Äù,"Email 

Democratic U.S. vice-presidential nominee Tim Kaine announced Saturday that he believes the Catholic Church will change its position on same-sex marriage. The Virginia senator said that just like he had changed his opinion on the issue, the Catholic Church is also likely to follow suit. Speaking at the 20th Annual Human Rights Campaign‚Äôs National Dinner in Washington, the Roman Catholic senator reportedly said, ‚ÄúI think it‚Äôs going to change because my church also teaches me about a creator who, in the first chapter of Genesis, surveyed the entire world, including mankind, and said, ‚ÄòIt is very good.‚Äô‚Äù 
‚ÄúAnd besides,‚Äù he continued, ‚Äúwe are talking here about a country that was based and founded on democracy as a core value. By definition, that means that every single person and every single citizen is able ‚Äì no, scratch that ‚Äì encouraged to practice his civil, religious, and above all, sexual liberties to the best of their abilities. And I‚Äôm sorry that some people don‚Äôt like it, but to deny same-sex marriage in a country that should be the first one to accept it is just pointless. And the Catholic Church should also be accepting it instead of condemning it, which is what it‚Äôs doing right now.‚Äù 
Kaine also added that, if all else fails, ‚Äúthere are ways of making the Catholic Church listen to the voice of reason,‚Äù which is how he dubbed all those who advocate LGBT equality. ‚ÄúAt the end of the day, you know, we‚Äôre a civilized people, of course the first thing we‚Äôll do is act nicely and ask nicely,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúThen, if that doesn‚Äôt work, we‚Äôll use our law and our legal system to enable ourselves to be who we are, or rather the LBGT community will do that ‚Äì and it has. The Supreme Court‚Äôs ruling on same-sex marriage was a crucial milestone in our legal system that proves it works, it actually functions.‚Äù 
‚ÄúSo, what I‚Äôm saying here,‚Äù he argued, ‚Äúis that, while I respect the Catholic Church as I‚Äôm sure millions of Americans do, you know, at some point it is going to start acting contrary to the Christian faith, and we‚Äôre talking about an institution that‚Äôs supposed to be the first one on the front line defending it. So, when that happens, and that‚Äôs what‚Äôs happening with condemning LGBT rights, we‚Äôll state an ultimatum. The United States of America, more precisely, the future President of the United States of America, Hillary Clinton, will state an ultimatum. And that ultimatum will be to either change its stance on same-sex marriage or pack its bags and get out of America. And yes ‚Äì the President of the country can do that.‚Äù 
‚ÄúAnd in case anybody‚Äôs wondering ‚Äì no, Donald Trump won‚Äôt do the same because he doesn‚Äôt care about anyone other than Donald Trump. On the other hand, Hillary Clinton is a shining example of honesty, integrity and democracy, and you can rest assured she will do everything in her power as the president to make sure gays and lesbians throughout America are loved, respected and viewed as equals during her presidential term. What happens after that is not our problem,‚Äù Kaine concluded.",1
Hillary: ‚ÄúWe Did Not Lose A Single Important Person In Libya‚Äù,"Email 

Hillary Clinton declared during NBC News‚Äôs Commander-in-Chief forum that no lives were lost in Libya when she made the move to take out dictator Muammar Gaddafi. Even so, the former secretary of state did not mention the fact that 11 months later four Americans ‚Äì including U.S. Ambassador Christopher Stevens ‚Äì were killed in a terrorist attack in Benghazi that arose from the instability that the overthrow created. 
‚ÄúThat was one of the few situations in American foreign policy decision making processes where everybody came together to make sure we don‚Äôt make the wrong move, and the operation was a success, even Donald Trump supported it,‚Äù Clinton argued. ‚ÄúAs with any operation of such magnitude, we had a few hiccups, but it was nothing out of the ordinary. As I‚Äôve said, the operation was a success.‚Äù 
She continued, ‚ÄúSo much so, in fact, that I‚Äôm proud to say that no important people were lost through it all, and when I say that, I say it with the utmost respect for all those who had to give their lives on both sides so that Libyans could be freed from the iron fist of Gaddafi. It would have been unrealistic to expect 0 casualties; however, the overall toll did not exceed expectations, with the greater amount of damage being on the side of the enemy.‚Äù 
‚ÄúPolitics can be a cruel line of work. That being said, I stand before you here, today, and I am proud to say that giving democracy to a people that have not had any contact with it for generations is a wonderful thing that makes all of the sacrifices worth it. And while we‚Äôre on the subject of sacrifices, thank God they did not include anyone important from the American delegation, including yours truly,‚Äù she said jokingly, causing the auditorium to laugh. 
She said, ‚ÄúBut all jokes aside, I have to pay homage to the CIA, who has once again performed outstandingly and saved the day. Its agents‚Äô work in the field is an immeasurable contribution and an asset that we would be wise to treasure for generations to come. If it hadn‚Äôt been for them, we would not have been able to perform the operation so cleanly and with such little impact to the surrounding nations. I am proud that the United States of America has an intelligence agency such as the CIA.‚Äù 
‚ÄúI‚Äôm sure many here among you disagree with my position that one embassy is a small price to pay, a bargain, if you will, when it comes to ridding the world of another dictator and a terrorist. I would also like to remind everyone here that that price would have gone up immeasurably if we had sat idly by and allowed Gaddafi to rage on and cause death and destruction throughout the region. For better of worse, we acted and I am convinced no other dictator will ever again think about cheating the CIA out of a deal. Because, in the words of a personal friend of mine, who is a former CIA spook ‚Äì shutting down arms dealers is easy; finding trustworthy partners among nation heads is the hard part,‚Äù she concluded.",1
"WikiLeaks: Clinton Confidant Raised Money for Foundation, Got Bill Paid Gigs","Email 

An internal memo released Wednesday by WikiLeaks reveals how a longtime Clinton confidant played an ""unorthodox"" dual role ‚Äì raising money for the Clinton Foundation and finding paid work for Bill Clinton, The Hill reports. 
The 12-page document written in 2011 by Doug Band of Teneo, a private consulting firm that raised millions for the foundation and also scouted out paid gigs for what was dubbed ""Bill Clinton, Inc."", the Washington Examiner reports. 
In one instance, Band secured a $540,000 donation to the Clinton Foundation from banking giant UBS. He later arranged for Bill Clinton to give three paid speeches to the firm for a total of $900,000, The Hill reported. 
But in his memo, Band argues his double duties were ""independent"" of one another; the memo was written after Chelsea Clinton criticized Band's role within the family's network of interests, The Hill reports. 
""In the unique roles in which we have had the opportunity to serve, we have been able to help balance the multiplicity of activities that demand [Bill Clinton's] time and engagement to best fulfill his personal, political, business, official former President, and Foundation/non-profit goals,"" Band writes. 
According to The Hill, Teneo's overlapping responsibilities worried some in the Clintons' inner circle, and in one email published by WikiLeaks, Chelsea Clinton raised ""serious concerns"" with Teneo's liberal use of the Clinton name to court clients. 
Band lashed out, calling the former first daughter a meddlesome ""spoiled brat"" in one hacked email released by WikiLeaks. 
""We appreciate the unorthodox nature of our roles, and the goal of seeking ways to ensure we are implementing best practices to protect the [tax exempt] status of the Foundation,"" Band wrote in his memo to justify his role and bat back criticism, The Hill reports. 
Band co-founded Teneo with former State Department employee Declan Kelly while Hillary Clinton was secretary of state ‚Äì and paid Bill Clinton as an adviser through 2012, The Hill reports. 
Band's memo lists several Teneo clients that he and Kelly ""leveraged"" into major donors for the foundation, and also details the personal introductions the two principals made between the Clintons and the prospective donors, The Hill reports. 
One that Kelly ""cultivated"" was Coca-Cola CEO Muhtar Kent, which led to seven-figure donations beginning in 2009. 
In a previous hacked email to Hillary Clinton campaign chairman John Podesta, Band worried the press might catch wind of his role and misconstrue it. 
""I'm starting to worry that if this story gets out, we are screwed,"" Band wrote. 
""[Kelly] and I built a business. Our business has almost nothing to do with the Clintons, the foundation or [the Clinton Global Initiative] in any way. The chairman of UBS could care a less [sic] about CGI."" 
A week after Band sent his memo, Clinton lawyer Cheryl Mills sent a document to Podesta and Band laying out ways to unwind the former president's charitable and business interests ‚Äî all of which distanced Band from the foundation. 
In December 2011, the former president resigned his position on Teneo‚Äôs advisory board, The Hill reports.",1
Hillary Planning Her Escape After a Trump Win With a $1.8 BILLION Money Transfer to QATAR,"Email 

It appears Bill and Hillary Clinton are making plans to flee the country in the event Donald Trump wins this election. Reports are circulating that the Clinton‚Äôs have transferred 1.8 Billion dollars from the Clinton Foundation to the Qatar Central Bank via a facilitation/abatement of JP Morgan Chase & Company for reasons not revealed. 
This move of such a large sum of money to the country of Qatar says in itself Hillary Clinton knows she is going to lose the election, and she doesn‚Äôt plan to allow her or Bill to be prosecuted for various high crimes and treason under a Trump Administration. 
The country of Qatar happens to be one of a handful of countries that does not have an extradition treaty with the United States, thus would be a perfect place for her to run to in escaping justice. 
Donald Trump has said many times during his campaign and at the Presidential debates that once he gets into office he intends to prosecute her on various high crimes from her latest crimes of sending classified material via a personal e-mail server to gun-running to terrorist groups in Syria resulting in the deaths of 4 Americans in Benghazi. 
Apparently, Hillary is not the only person in Washington who has made plans to escape justice under a Trump Administration, John Kerry has quietly been selling his property in the US for millions of dollars of late, with an announcement of the sale of his $25 million Nantucket mansion in June 2016 as well as the sale of his yacht for $3.9 million in July 2016. 
President Barack H Obama has also apparently been making exit plans with his purchase of a $4.9 million seaside mansion in Dubai in January 2016, another non extradition country. 
Snopes and other supposed fact checking sites have debunked both the story of Obama‚Äôs purchase of the mansion and the firing of Rear Admiral Rick Williams, however over the last several months these sites have been busted for lying in trying to debunk such information as the before mentioned, when in fact the information is true. Snopes and other sites try their best to keep incriminating information from being believed, but the truth has a way of coming out on its own, as it always has. 
The Bush family has been quietly buying property as well with the purchase of 100,000 acres in Paraguay in 2006, yet another country good for the Bush family, since it does not allow extradition to any country if the death penalty is a possibility for the crime. If the corruption is found to go as far back as both of the Bush Administrations with any connections to them being the perpetrators of the events on 9-11, the death penalty would surely be a stipulation of any extradition request. Apparently, if things get going with prosecuting the corrupt and treasonous, the Bush‚Äôs plan on getting out of the country as well. 
Interestingly, the Bush family‚Äôs Nazi connections dating back to WWII seem to have played a part in the Paraguay purchase since most Nazis fled to South America after WWII. Since George H. W. Bush‚Äôs father Senator Prescott Bush was director and shareholder in companies that were connected with institutions financially backing the Nazis, the Bush family has a long history of being associated with Nazis. 
With the movement of huge amounts of funds, selling millions of dollars in real estate, and the purchase of millions in real estate overseas, we are seeing the plans of the corrupt in Washington who have been ripping of our country in the trillions, murdering US citizens in the thousands, and citizens in foreign countries by the millions since 9-11 finally realizing their crimes against humanity is about to be exposed. 
We are also witnessing the change from what amounts to nothing more than a Nazi Dictatorship in Washington to an actual Presidential Administration who not only will look to the Constitution as the basis of all laws, but one who is going to prosecute the criminals in our government and return it to being a government by the people, for the people, and of the people of the USA. Not the Dictatorship over the people, to the people and who disregards the people as we now have in power.",1
IOWA FARMER CLAIMS BILL CLINTON HAD SEX WITH COW DURING ‚ÄòCOCAINE PARTY‚Äô,"Email 

Sioux Falls, IA | During his 1992 presidential campaign, Bill Clinton allegedly had sexual intercourse with cattle off of Tom Brady‚Äôs family dairy farm. 
The family farm which was owned by Tom Brady‚Äôs father at the time, Willow Brady Jr., was often visited by the Clinton family when they were in the area. 
‚ÄúMy dad and Bill Clinton‚Äôs step dad were like brothers. They often visited us on the holidays when I was a kid. Bill even knew the cows names by heart. That always surprised me‚Äù recalls the 64-year-old, third-generation dairy farmer. 
‚Äú My father was a strong Democratic party supporter all his life and a big Bill Clinton fan, so I never found the strength to tell him the truth before he passed away ‚Äù 
Sex, drugs and cattle 
During the 1992 Iowa caucus, the Clinton campaign stopped by for a night of festivities at the Brady‚Äôs farm, a night Tom Brady says he will never forget. 
‚ÄúThe Clinton team came by and we drank a lot and all was merry before they started indulging in hard drugs, that‚Äôs when everything went wrong‚Äù he recalls, visibly distraught by the whole affair. 
‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know about all those stories about him sexually assaulting women, but I sure as hell know he assaulted one of our cows because I was there and I saw him do it with my own eyes and believe me, it‚Äôs not something I‚Äôd wish my worst enemy to live to see‚Äù he told local reporters. 
‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry for the Clinton family, but as a God-fearing Christian, I just had to let the truth be known‚Äù he adds. 
Bill Clinton has been personally accused publicly by seventeen women of sexual misconduct between 1972 and 1997. The former US President also admitted to having had an ‚Äúinappropriate relationship‚Äù with Monica Lewinsky while she worked at the White House in 1995 and 1996.",1
Clinton cronies steered millions to foundation ‚Äî and Bill‚Äôs wallet,"Email 

Two Bill Clinton cronies used their private consulting firm to steer millions in business to the former president while raising funds for the Clinton Foundation ‚Äî and even called the arrangement ‚ÄúBill Clinton Inc.‚Äù 
Doug Band, a top Clinton aide, detailed the complex financial arrangement between his company, Teneo, and the foundation in a memo contained in hacked e-mails released Wednesday by WikiLeaks. 
‚ÄúTeneo partners have raised in excess of $8 million for the foundation, more than $5.25 million of which is in the bank,‚Äù the memo reads. 
‚ÄúTeneo partners also have generated over $3 million in paid speeches for President Clinton, $1.25 million of which has been paid to him thus far.‚Äù 
The consulting company was formed by Band and former State Department envoy Declan Kelly. The memo about its activities shows the incestuous relationship between the foundation and the private business interests of the former president. 
In one arrangement, Kelly introduced Bob McCann, the head of UBS Wealth Management, to Clinton at an event in 2009. 
After the meeting, McCann donated hundreds of thousands to the foundation while inviting Clinton to give several paid speeches. 
Another arrangement involved the Laureate Foundation, which donated more than $1 million to the Clinton Global Initiative. 
Laureate was a ‚Äúpersonal advisory services business,‚Äù the memo said, paying Clinton ‚Äú$3.5‚Äâmillion annually to provide advice and serve as their honorary chairman.‚Äù 
The cozy relationship with the Clintons put the Baltimore-based Laureate at high-profile events with international players who could help it expand its reach around the globe. 
The Band memo also includes a section about ‚ÄúFor-Profit Activity of President Clinton (i.e., Bill Clinton Inc.).‚Äù 
Some of the speeches ‚Äúsecured‚Äù by Teneo include two $450,000 addresses delivered to UBS in 2011 and 2012, as well as a commitment for three additional paid speeches, if he chose to give them. 
Another secured event was a $1 million fee for Clinton to speak at two one-hour sessions during an event in Hong Kong. The fee included $400,000 for a private plane. 
‚ÄúSince 2001, President Clinton‚Äôs business arrangements have yielded more than $30 million for him personally, with $66 million to be paid out over the next nine years should he choose to continue with the current engagements,‚Äù the memo reads. 
The relationship between Band and the donors was criticized harshly by daughter Chelsea Clinton in another e-mail. 
Chelsea specifically called out Band and Teneo for ‚Äúhustling‚Äô‚Äù business opportunities out of the foundation. 
‚ÄúI continue to want ‚Äî and to try ‚Äî to disintermediate myself from this muddle, edify the corporate audit and existential process we are in ‚Äî while also being a responsible board member, daughter and person,‚Äù Chelsea wrote in the 2011 e-mail. 
The relationship between foundation donors and Hillary Clinton‚Äôs State Department was raised through e-mails obtained by Citizens United in which top Hillary aide Huma Abedin appeared to vet donors‚Äô access to the Clintons based on their links to the CGI. 
In a December 2012 e-mail in which a CGI official asks for Band and a few others to meet with Hillary during a trip to Ireland, Abedin writes to Band, ‚ÄúAre these legit cgi people?‚Äù",1
"Biden Blames ‚ÄúLazy American Women‚Äù For The Economy: ‚ÄúThey Sit Around Doing Nothing, Only Hillary Can Force Them To Work‚Äù","Email 

Democratic Vice President Joe Biden wants American women to get back in the workforce to help boost the economy. ‚ÄúIf we just put all the women back to work, if they were able to afford childcare, we would increase the GDP in America by close to eight tenths of one percent,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs trillions of dollars over the next decade.‚Äù 
Biden made his remarks during a campaign event for Hillary Clinton at Chatham University in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania on Tuesday. ‚ÄúThe state of our economy could be characterized by a single word: pitiful,‚Äù he argued. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre still battling recession, I don‚Äôt care what the official stats are saying, America is still in recession. And we‚Äôre not doing anything about it.‚Äù 
He added that it was ‚Äúlazy American women‚Äù who brought about the downfall of the economy, because ‚Äúthey sit around on their behinds, doing nothing and squandering their days away when they could be improving the country that has given so much to them.‚Äù ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not sure how exactly we got to this point, but we‚Äôre here and we need to move. Like, yesterday,‚Äù he said. 
‚ÄúMark my words and mark them well,‚Äù he addressed the crowd. ‚ÄúHillary Clinton is the only one who can force American women to go to work. This is true because of a number of reasons. First, she‚Äôs a woman herself and not just any woman; she‚Äôs a self-made woman. So you better believe what she‚Äôs saying is true and has been tried and tested in practice plenty of times.‚Äù 
‚ÄúSecond, Hillary Clinton understands how difficult it can be to give up the status of a free-loader when your husband is the bread-winner of the household and the wife is expected to tend to the house, the children, make sure dinner is served and always be in the mood for marital duties. She‚Äôs been all that and she‚Äôs learned how to break free from it, the hard way, I might add,‚Äù Biden continued. 
‚ÄúToday‚Äôs women are pampered and aren‚Äôt used to rolling up their sleeves and getting the job done on their own,‚Äù the vice president said. ‚ÄúThey‚Äôre too dependent, too weak and too lazy to contribute to the economy. The reason for that is they‚Äôve learned how to manipulate men by employing one of the most fundamental laws of economics: when a sought-after commodity becomes short in supply, the demand for it rises even higher.‚Äù 
‚ÄúNow, that‚Äôs all fine and dandy when it comes to their personal interests, but if you look at the big picture, it‚Äôs the economy that‚Äôs missing out on valuable workforce. And that‚Äôs why we need to get them off their lazy behinds and get them into their workplaces. And like I said, Hillary Clinton is the only one who can do it, which is what makes her the ideal candidate for the next President of the United States. We need to heal this country, folks, not run it into the ground even deeper,‚Äù Biden concluded.",1
TRUMP CALLS FOR TEACHING ‚ÄòPATRIOTISM‚Äô IN SCHOOLS,"Email 

REPUBLICAN PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE DONALD TRUMP SIGNALED THURSDAY PLANS TO SEEK NATIONWIDE CHANGES TO SCHOOL CURRICULA WITH THE GOAL OF ‚ÄúPROMOTING AMERICAN PRIDE AND PATRIOTISM IN AMERICA‚ÄôS SCHOOLS.‚Äù 
‚ÄúIn a Trump administration, I plan to work directly with the American Legion to uphold our common values and to help ensure they are taught to America‚Äôs children,‚Äù Trump said, speaking at the American Legion‚Äôs annual convention in Cincinnati. 
‚ÄúWe want our kids to learn the incredible achievements of America‚Äôs history, its institutions and its heroes, many of whom are with us today,‚Äù he told the veterans group. 
The comments suggested a federal government intervention in the programs of locally run schools, which is prohibited under federal law‚ÄúWe will stop apologizing for America. And we will start celebrating America. We will be united by our common culture, values and principles, becoming one American nation, one country, under one Constitution, saluting one American flag, and always saluting it,‚Äù Trump said. 
Last year a Denver-area school board sought to change the content of the AP U.S. history course because some board members thought it failed to promote patriotism. 
That sparked a political proxy war in Jefferson County, Colorado, and the 2015 school board election drew nearly $1 million in campaign funding from outside interest groups. 
Public schools nationwide are funded by their local communities along with some state money. Most schools receive little federal funding. 
Current federal law prohibits the federal government from exercising ‚Äúany direction, supervision, or control over the curriculum, program of instruction, administration, or personnel of any educational institution, school, or school system.‚Äù",1

Poll: 41 percent of voters say election could be ‚Äòstolen‚Äô,"Email 
The Politico/Morning Consult Poll finds that 41 percent of voters think widespread voter fraud could cause the GOP nominee to lose the election. Amid Trump's increased warnings about a ""rigged election,"" 73 percent of Republicans think the election could be stolen from him, compared to 17 percent of Democrats. 
Over the past week, Trump has cast doubt on the American electoral system, saying he believes the results will be ""rigged"" at many polling places. 
""The election is absolutely being rigged by the dishonest and distorted media pushing Crooked Hillary ‚Äî but also at many polling places ‚Äî SAD,"" Trump wrote on Twitter Sunday. 
Trump has also encouraged supporters to keep an eye on voting locations to prevent fraud, which some say is a ploy to intimidate voters. 
Trump is trailing Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton in the polls following sexual assault and harassment allegations from multiple women. 
The Politico/Morning Consult poll showed Clinton leading Trump by 5 points, 46 to 41 percent. 
In a RealClearPolitics polling average, Clinton leads Trump by 5.5 points, 47.7 to 42.2 percent. 
While Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) and even Trump's running mate, Indiana Gov. Mike Pence, have tried to reassure the electorate about the reliability of the election system, the poll released Monday found 60 percent of Americans think it is necessary to question the accuracy of the election results. 
The poll was conducted among 1,999 registered voters Oct. 13‚Äì15 and has a margin of error of 2 percentage points.",1
Hillary Clinton accused of stealing furniture from the State Department,"Email 
Hillary Clinton swiped State Department furniture to decorate her Washington home, a former member of her security detail has alleged to the FBI. 
‚ÄúEarly in Clinton‚Äôs tenure as secretary of state, she and her staff were observed removing lamps and furniture from the State Department which were transported to her residence in Washington, DC,‚Äù an agent on the detail told the FBI. 
The agent ‚Äúdoes not know whether these items were ever returned to the government,‚Äù according to FBI notes. 
The agent was assigned to Clinton in 2009, at the start of her term, but was not on the detail when Clinton left in 2013. 
The accusations were part of 100 newly released pages of interview notes of the FBI investigation into Clinton‚Äôs handling of classified material. 
The department flatly denied the latest charges, saying Clinton took home only property that she owned.",1
WIKILEAKS: Hillary Got $12 Million for Clinton Charity As Quid Pro Quo For Morocco Meeting,"Email 
Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton arranged a $12 million donation from Moroccan King Mohammed VI to her family‚Äôs charity in 2014 in return for the Clinton Global Initiative hosting its international meeting in the North African Muslim nation, according to an email made public Thursday by Wikileaks. 
The Moroccan monarch‚Äôs funds went to the Clinton Foundation‚Äôs endowment and to CGI. The Jan. 18, 2015, email was included in Wikileaks‚Äô latest batch of communications to and from Clinton‚Äôs presidential campaign chairman, John Podesta. 
The email from Huma Abedin, Clinton‚Äôs Deputy Chief of Staff at the State Department, was addressed to Podesta and campaign manager Robby Mook. Hillary Clinton was a director of the foundation at the time. 
Singapore and Hong Kong officials reportedly were also vying to convene the CGI meeting in their countries, but the North African nation ultimately hosted it in a five-star hotel in Marrakesh, Morocco, in 2015. Abedin told Podesta and Mook that Morocco was not CGI‚Äôs ‚Äúfirst choice.‚Äù 
The actual meeting was paid for by OCP, the Moroccan-government-owned mining company that has been accused of serious human rights violations. Clinton vigorously supported the Moroccan King when she was Secretary of State and the U.S.-financed Export-Import Bank gave OCP a $92 million loan guarantee during her tenure as Secretary of State. 
The mining company also contributed between $5 million to $10 million to the Clinton Foundation, according to the charity‚Äôs web site.Abedin described the arrangement in the email as having been organized by her boss. Hillary Clinton ‚Äúcreated this mess and she knows it,‚Äù she told Podesta and Mook.She said the Moroccan deal was entirely dreamed up by her boss. ‚ÄúThis was HRC‚Äôs idea, our office approached the Moroccans and they 100 percent believe they are doing this at her request. The King has personally committed approx. $12 million both for the endowment and to support the meeting.‚Äù HRC stands for Hillary Rodham Clinton. 
Abedin said Clinton‚Äôs attendance at the CGI event was a condition of the $12 million contribution. ‚ÄúJust to give you some context, the condition upon which the Moroccans agreed to host the meeting was her participation. If hrc was not part if it, meeting was a non-starter,‚Äù Abedin said. 
Politico in 2015 reported that Clinton ‚Äúwas seen by Rabat as among its most ardent supporters in the Obama administration.‚Äù Rabat is the capital of Morocco. 
The Robert F. Kennedy Center for Justice charged OCP with ‚Äúserious human rights violations,‚Äù including exploitation of workers by not ‚Äúadequately compensating the impoverished people who live there.‚Äù 
Mohamed Yeslem Beisat, the Washington envoy for the Polisaro Front, as reported by AL-Monitor, a Middle East news site in 2015 that ‚ÄúOCP is the first beneficiary of the war and the first beneficiary of the occupation ‚Äî it is the one that is cashing in on the misery of thousands of refugees and hundreds of political detainees for the past 40 years.‚Äù 
Polisaro claims to lead a Moroccan government-in-exile based in Tindouf, Algeria. 
‚ÄúThey‚Äôre doing this because they know Hillary has some chances of being president of the United States. And they want her to support their brutal occupation of Western Sahara,‚Äù Beisat charged. 
The Moroccan firm mines phosphates. Human rights critics have called OCP‚Äôs mining product ‚Äúblood phosphates,‚Äù appropriating the term ‚Äúblood diamonds‚Äù for gems mined in operations that kill and injure local workers 
OCP is not the only mining company linked to human rights violations that has donated to the Clinton Foundation. The foundation accepted a $100 million pledge from Lukas Lundin, who owns mining and oil drilling operations in North Africa and in the Congo. (RELATED: Clinton Foundation Got $100M From ‚ÄòBlood Minerals‚Äô Firm) 
OCP retained the law firm of Covington & Burling, one of Washington‚Äôs lobbying giants, paying the firm $1.4 million in fees from 2012 to 2015. 
Stuart Eizenstat, a former White House domestic policy chief under President Carter and an influential Democratic Party insider, was the main lobbyist for the mining firm. He was also President Bill Clinton‚Äôs ambassador to the European Union, a Deputy Secretary of the Treasury and Under Secretary at the Department of Commerce. 
Eizenstat specialized in foreign trade issues at Commerce where he worked in the International Trade Administration. 
Hillary Clinton officially visited Morocco twice, in November 2009 and in February 2012, meeting with the King on both occasions. The two also met in New York in December 2013 where it was believed the two discussed Morocco‚Äôs bid to host the CGI meeting and the King‚Äôs $12 million donation. 
The Moroccan World News described the meeting as showing ‚Äúrenewed friendship between the royal family and the Clinton family, as well as Hillary Clinton‚Äôs esteem for Morocco and its people.‚Äù 
Abedin warned both campaign executives that if CGI decided to renege on the agreement, it would hurt Clinton‚Äôs relationship with the King. ‚ÄúIt will break a lot of china to back out now,‚Äù she wrote. 
Ultimately, Clinton did not attend the meeting because it was close to the launch of her presidential campaign, but the former president and daughter Chelsea were present and during the conference were guests at one of the Moroccan King‚Äôs palaces.",1
Trump warns of World War III if Clinton is elected,"Email Donald Trump warned in an interview Tuesday that Hillary Clinton's policies as president to address the Syrian conflict would lead to World War III, arguing the Democratic nominee would draw the US into armed confrontation with Russia, Syria and Iran. ""What we should do is focus on ISIS. We should not be focusing on Syria,"" Trump told Reuters on Tuesday morning at his resort in Doral, Florida. ""You're going to end up in World War III over Syria if we listen to Hillary Clinton."" The Republican nominee, who has called for a rapprochement with Russia in order to jointly combat ISIS, argued that his Democratic rival's calls for taking a more aggressive posture in Syria to bring the conflict there to an end and combat ISIS will only draw the US into a larger war. Trump's remarks come as he trails Clinton in most national and key battleground state polls just two weeks from Election Day. ""You're not fighting Syria anymore, you're fighting Syria, Russia and Iran, all right? Russia is a nuclear country, but a country where the nukes work as opposed to other countries that talk,"" he said. Trump: I'd 'love' to fight Biden Trump has not laid out a clear strategy for combating ISIS or addressing the globally destabilizing conflict in Syria, which has killed hundreds of thousands and pushed millions more to flee their homes. He has suggested the US should allow ISIS, anti-government rebels and the Syrian government to fight it out and more recently has focused on joining forces with Russia -- which has aided the Syrian regime in the bombing of civilians and US-allied rebels -- to combat ISIS. ""Assad is secondary, to me, to ISIS,"" Trump told Reuters of the Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, whom US officials have argued must step down. Clinton has called for establishing a no-fly zone over Syria to help bring the five-year civil war to an end, a proposal top Republicans in Congress have championed, which President Barack Obama and others have opposed due to the risk of entering into conflict with Russia. A US-enforced no-fly zone would mean the US could shoot down a Russian jet should it enter Syrian airspace. Clinton addressed those concerns in the final presidential debate, arguing that it would ""save lives and hasten the end of the conflict,"" while cautioning that ""this would not be done just on the first day."" ""This would take a lot of negotiation and it would also take making it clear to the Russians and the Syrians that our purpose is to provide safe zones on the ground,"" Clinton said during the debate earlier this month. ""I think we could strike a deal and make it very clear to the Russians and Syrians that this was something that we believe the best interests of the people on the ground in Syria. It would help us in the fight against ISIS."" Trump has additionally called for establishing safe zones in Syria to protect civilians -- as has Clinton -- which could also put the US in conflict with the Syrian government or Russia should they oppose the policy. The Clinton campaign later Tuesday pushed back against Trump's rhetoric. ""National security experts on both sides of the aisle have denounced Donald Trump as dangerously ill-prepared and temperamentally unfit to serve as commander-in-chief,"" Clinton spokesman Jesse Lehrich said. ""Once again, he is parroting Putin's talking points and playing to Americans' fears, all while refusing to lay out any plans of his own for defeating ISIS or alleviating humanitarian suffering in Syria. Moreover, this incendiary attack is aimed at a policy that his own running mate, Mike Pence, strongly supports."" Poll: Most see a Hillary Clinton victory and a fair count ahead While Clinton has accused Trump of being Putin's ""puppet,"" Trump knocked Clinton for her criticism of the Russian strongman, asking, ""How she is going to go back and negotiate with this man who she has made to be so evil."" And just two days after he tied the successful enactment of his agenda as president to the election of Republican majorities in Congress, Trump also returned to his more typical complaints of a lack of Republican unity weighing down his candidacy. ""If we had party unity, we couldn't lose this election to Hillary Clinton,"" he told Reuters. That complaint didn't put Trump in more of a bipartisan mood, though, as the Republican nominee also told Reuters he would not consider putting any Democrats in his cabinet -- a departure from recent presidents, who have sought to post at least one member of their rival party in a top administration post.",1
Obama slams Trump's 'rigged' election claims as 'dangerous',"Email President Barack Obama admonished Donald Trump Thursday, saying the Republican nominee's claims that he might not accept the results of next month's election are ""not a joking matter."" ""I want everybody to pay attention here. This is dangerous,"" Obama said at a Hillary for America event in Miami Gardens, Florida. ""Because when you try to sow the seeds of doubt in people's mind about the legitimacy of our elections, that undermines our democracy. Then you are doing the work of our adversaries for them."" Obama also encouraged the crowd of about 1,800 at Florida Memorial University to take advantage of Florida's early voting, telling the audience in doing so they can reject what the President called Trump's ""dark, pessimistic fear-mongering."" ""Our democracy depends on people knowing that their vote matters. That those who occupy the seats of power were chosen by the people,"" Obama said. On Wednesday night's debate Trump, answered, ""I will look at it at the time,"" when asked whether he would concede if he loses on November 8. ""I will keep you in suspense."" Trump also doubled down on Thursday in Ohio saying he will accept the results of next month's election as long as wins. Obama also used the opportunity while in Florida to weigh in on the close Senate race in Florida between Republican Sen. Marco Rubio and his Democratic challenger, Rep. Patrick Murphy. ""Even Marco Rubio says there's no rigging of the vote,"" Obama said, ""Which I'd like to give credit for, except he's refuting the dangerous, unprecedented claims of a candidate he says he's still going to vote for!"" Earlier this week, Obama released a new ad for the Democrat in the Sunshine State, the same week it was announced the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee was puling money for ads for Murphy.",1
Donald Trump claims the election will be 'rigged' ‚Äî and critics have called that preposterous and dangerous,"Email 
Donald Trump is again riling up his voting base with claims that the November election will be rigged against him. 
""Of course there is large scale voter fraud happening on and before election day,"" Trump tweeted Monday morning. ""Why do Republican leaders deny what is going on? So naive!"" 
It's a charge that even other Republicans have been quick to refute. Critics have called such talk potentially dangerous and detrimental to trust in the US democratic process. 
""States, backed by tens of thousands of GOP and DEM volunteers, ensure integrity of electoral process,"" Sen. Jeff Flake of Arizona, who is often sharply critical of Trump, tweeted Sunday. ""Elections are not rigged."" 
Jon Husted, the secretary of state of Ohio and the top election official in the key battleground state, also said Monday that he could assure Trump the election would not be rigged. 
Trump's most recent claims coincided with a plunge by him in the polls. Before now, Trump most recently made similar claims when his polls numbers were taking a dive in early August. 
""And I'm telling you, November 8, we'd better be careful, because that election is going to be rigged,"" the New York billionaire told Fox News host Sean Hannity in August. ""And I hope the Republicans are watching closely or it's going to be taken away from us."" 
Multiple Republicans told Business Insider at the time that Trump's assertion was both ludicrous and dangerous, as Trump would be the first US presidential candidate in modern times, possibly ever, to blame an election loss on voter fraud or a rigged election. 
Allen Raymond, a former GOP operative who was involved in the 2002 New Hampshire Senate election phone-jamming scandal, called Trump's continued insistence that the election would be rigged ""detrimental to the Republic."" 
""The idea that it's rigged, I don't know what he's talking about,"" he said in August. ""I know someone that rigged elections. I mean, you know, the fact of the matter is Hillary Clinton doesn't need to rig this election. Trump's going to win Alabama and that's it. She doesn't have to do anything. It's painful to watch."" 
Raymond wrote ""How to Rig an Election: Confessions of a Republican Operative"" as a tell-all about the attempt to rig the 2002 New Hampshire Senate election between then-Gov. Jeanne Shaheen, a Democrat, and Republican US Rep. John E. Sununu. Raymond said that attempted rigging was centered on jamming the phone lines at the New Hampshire Democrats office in Manchester ‚Äî a task his phone bank was hired to carry out. Sununu went on to win the election by roughly 20,000 votes. Shaheen defeated Sununu in a rematch in 2008. 
The operative served a brief prison sentence for his involvement.He said any attempts to rig an election would look similar to that ‚Äî not what Trump's talking about. 
The Manhattan billionaire told The Washington Post in August that a lack of voter-identification laws would let people ""just keep voting and voting and voting"" and suggested fraud occurred in 2012 against Republican nominee Mitt Romney because there were ""precincts where there were practically nobody voting for the Republican."" 
""I don't even know what he's talking about,"" Raymond said. ""But this idea that it's 1950 or 1960 and the party bosses are going to roll into Pittsburgh and Philadelphia and are going to rig the ballot box and rig the machines ‚Äî that's nonsense. An election rigging these days means something totally different than what he's talking about. Now it's stupid stuff like what I did in New Hampshire."" 
He said the lack of voter-ID laws Trump was trying to use as proof of fraud this fall was also bogus. 
""These voter-ID laws, what's the intention of that? The clear intention is disenfranchisement,"" he said, echoing a common complaint in liberal circles that voter-ID laws are put in place to prevent minority voting blocks from being able to cast ballots. ""You know, there's a reason we don't have a poll tax anymore. Because it's unconstitutional. 
""People don't vote 10 times,"" he continued. ""There might be one bad actor every once in a while who tries to vote a couple of times, but he's talking about an institutional effort. It's a total myth."" 
He said Trump's statements were an attempt to ""basically sideline"" Hillary Clinton's first four years in office. 
The idea of a rigged election came to the forefront after the Democratic National Committee had its emails hacked and leaked, though both Trump and Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont, Clinton's main opponent in the Democratic primary, had claimed the electoral system was rigged earlier in the primary season. The emails showed that the organization, which was supposed to remain neutral throughout the primary, favored Clinton. 
Trump said the email leak proved that the primary election was ""rigged"" against Sanders in his early-August interview with Hannity, in addition to such claims he perpetuated along the campaign trail. He used the leak as further evidence that the fall election would be rigged against him as well.",1
Trump says he‚Äôd be ‚Äòneutral‚Äô with Israelis and Palestinians,"Email 
Leading Republican presidential hopeful suggests Israeli-Palestinian peace accord may be impossible: ‚ÄòSometimes agreements can‚Äôt be made‚ÄôAfter being asked by a voter at a Charleston, South Carolina, town hall event hosted by MSNBC about what steps he would take to broker an accommodation between the sides in the conflict, the GOP contender vowed to give it ‚Äúone hell of a shot‚Äù and called it ‚Äúprobably the toughest agreement of any kind to make.‚ÄùBut when pressed by host Joe Scarborough over whether he ascribed fault to either Israelis or Palestinians over the failure to reach a lasting accord, Trump declined to take sides. 
‚ÄúYou know, I don‚Äôt want to get into it, because ‚Ä¶ If I win, I don‚Äôt want to be in a position where I‚Äôm saying to you and the other side now says, ‚ÄòWe don‚Äôt want Trump involved,'‚Äù Trump said. 
‚ÄúLet me be sort of a neutral guy,‚Äù he continued. ‚ÄúA lot of people have gone down in flames trying to make that deal. So I don‚Äôt want to say whose fault is it. I don‚Äôt think it helps.‚ÄùTrump also expressed skepticism over the possibility of achieving a two-state solution, given the conditions of the conflict and the need for any agreement to be sustainable over time. 
‚ÄúIt‚Äôs possible it‚Äôs not makeable, because don‚Äôt forget it has to last ‚Äî it‚Äôs wonderful to make it and it doesn‚Äôt work, but it has to last,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúTo make lasting peace there? Probably the toughest deal of all, but I‚Äôm going to give it a shot.‚Äù 
Though he was not asked directly what he considers the most substantial obstacles standing in the way of a peace agreement, he suggested that growing hostility between the two peoples was contributing to the current stalemate, and what he considers the root of the conflict. 
‚ÄúA lot of people say an agreement can‚Äôt be made, which is okay. I mean, sometimes agreements can‚Äôt be made. Not good, but, you know, you have both sides really, but one side in particular, growing up and learning that these are the worst people,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúI was with a very prominent Israeli the other day. He says it‚Äôs impossible, because the other side has been trained from the time they‚Äôre children to hate Jewish people.‚ÄùIn the past, Trump has questioned Israel‚Äôs commitment to peace, while at the same time suggesting the Jewish state does not have a negotiating partner in the Palestinians. He has also called Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu ‚Äúa good friend.‚Äù 
At a presidential candidates forum hosted by the Republican Jewish Coalition in December 2015, the real estate magnate said, ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know that Israel has the commitment to make it, and I don‚Äôt know that the other side has the commitment to make it.‚Äù 
He made the same point in an interview with AP earlier that day: ‚ÄúA lot will have to do with Israel and whether or not Israel wants to make the deal ‚Äî whether or not Israel‚Äôs willing to sacrifice certain things,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúThey may not be, and I understand that, and I‚Äôm okay with that. But then you‚Äôre just not going to have a deal.‚Äù

Busted: Bill Recorded Telling Mistress To Deny That Clintons Helped Her Get A State Job,"Email 

Former President Bill Clinton can be heard telling his former mistress, Gennifer Flowers, to deny that he helped her get a state job in a series of recorded phone conversation from 1991. 
‚ÄúIf they ever asked if you‚Äôd talked to me about it, you can say no,‚Äù Clinton is heard saying in the recording. 
At the time, the media was making inquiries about Flowers‚Äô alleged affair with Clinton, and she was concerned that they may question how she got a job as administrative assistant for the Arkansas Appeal Tribunal. 
Clinton can also be heard telling Flowers how to handle a grievance filed by soemone else who applied for the same positioned and claimed she was more qualified than Flowers. 
Flowers famously recorded a series of conversation she had with Clinton from December 1990 to December 1991, while he was still Governor of Arkansas. The audio segments about the state job were widely reported in the 1990‚Äôs, however, as other pay-for-play financial scandals have surfaced, the details may warrant revisiting. 

Here is a transcript of part of the recording: 
GF ‚Äì But anyway, then Wednesday, there was a grievance filed in my office when I got the job by a girl who felt like she should have gotten it, a black girl named (deleted). And they called me as a witness. So I go in and uh, nothing big came of it. It‚Äôs just that they were questioning me about how I found out about the job. And I said, ‚ÄúWell, that personnel said it that it was a possibility there would be a position,‚Äù and then uh, ‚Äúthey told me that it would be advertised in the newspaper. And it was and I pursued it from there. 
BC ‚Äì Good for you. 
GF: Yeah. We had a little bit of a scare recently because she had a spot on an X-ray. And she went and had it checked again and it wasn‚Äôt cancer. And it‚Äôs been almost, it‚Äôll be two years in May that she‚Äôs now diagnosed cancer free. My stepfather has been through two angioplasties, but he‚Äôs doing good. And I am, I‚Äôm really, Bill what I‚Äôm afraid of is that if somebody in the press finds out that I‚Äôm working for the state. 
BC ‚Äì Yeah. 
GF ‚Äì They‚Äôre going to make a big deal of it. 
BC ‚Äì Yeah. 
GF ‚Äì Well the only thing that concerns me, where I‚Äôm, where I‚Äôm concerned at this point is the state job.

Democratic U.S. vice-presidential nominee Tim Kaine announced Saturday that he believes the Catholic Church will change its position on same-sex marriage. The Virginia senator said that just like he had changed his opinion on the issue, the Catholic Church is also likely to follow suit. Speaking at the 20th Annual Human Rights Campaign‚Äôs National Dinner in Washington, the Roman Catholic senator reportedly said, ‚ÄúI think it‚Äôs going to change because my church also teaches me about a creator who, in the first chapter of Genesis, surveyed the entire world, including mankind, and said, ‚ÄòIt is very good.‚Äô‚Äù 
‚ÄúAnd besides,‚Äù he continued, ‚Äúwe are talking here about a country that was based and founded on democracy as a core value. By definition, that means that every single person and every single citizen is able ‚Äì no, scratch that ‚Äì encouraged to practice his civil, religious, and above all, sexual liberties to the best of their abilities. And I‚Äôm sorry that some people don‚Äôt like it, but to deny same-sex marriage in a country that should be the first one to accept it is just pointless. And the Catholic Church should also be accepting it instead of condemning it, which is what it‚Äôs doing right now.‚Äù 
Kaine also added that, if all else fails, ‚Äúthere are ways of making the Catholic Church listen to the voice of reason,‚Äù which is how he dubbed all those who advocate LGBT equality. ‚ÄúAt the end of the day, you know, we‚Äôre a civilized people, of course the first thing we‚Äôll do is act nicely and ask nicely,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúThen, if that doesn‚Äôt work, we‚Äôll use our law and our legal system to enable ourselves to be who we are, or rather the LBGT community will do that ‚Äì and it has. The Supreme Court‚Äôs ruling on same-sex marriage was a crucial milestone in our legal system that proves it works, it actually functions.‚Äù 
‚ÄúSo, what I‚Äôm saying here,‚Äù he argued, ‚Äúis that, while I respect the Catholic Church as I‚Äôm sure millions of Americans do, you know, at some point it is going to start acting contrary to the Christian faith, and we‚Äôre talking about an institution that‚Äôs supposed to be the first one on the front line defending it. So, when that happens, and that‚Äôs what‚Äôs happening with condemning LGBT rights, we‚Äôll state an ultimatum. The United States of America, more precisely, the future President of the United States of America, Hillary Clinton, will state an ultimatum. And that ultimatum will be to either change its stance on same-sex marriage or pack its bags and get out of America. And yes ‚Äì the President of the country can do that.‚Äù 
‚ÄúAnd in case anybody‚Äôs wondering ‚Äì no, Donald Trump won‚Äôt do the same because he doesn‚Äôt care about anyone other than Donald Trump. On the other hand, Hillary Clinton is a shining example of honesty, integrity and democracy, and you can rest assured she will do everything in her power as the president to make sure gays and lesbians throughout America are loved, respected and viewed as equals during her presidential term. What happens after that is not our problem,‚Äù Kaine concluded.",1
"WikiLeaks: Clinton Confidant Raised Money for Foundation, Got Bill Paid Gigs","Email 

An internal memo released Wednesday by WikiLeaks reveals how a longtime Clinton confidant played an ""unorthodox"" dual role ‚Äì raising money for the Clinton Foundation and finding paid work for Bill Clinton, The Hill reports. 
The 12-page document written in 2011 by Doug Band of Teneo, a private consulting firm that raised millions for the foundation and also scouted out paid gigs for what was dubbed ""Bill Clinton, Inc."", the Washington Examiner reports. 
In one instance, Band secured a $540,000 donation to the Clinton Foundation from banking giant UBS. He later arranged for Bill Clinton to give three paid speeches to the firm for a total of $900,000, The Hill reported. 
But in his memo, Band argues his double duties were ""independent"" of one another; the memo was written after Chelsea Clinton criticized Band's role within the family's network of interests, The Hill reports. 
""In the unique roles in which we have had the opportunity to serve, we have been able to help balance the multiplicity of activities that demand [Bill Clinton's] time and engagement to best fulfill his personal, political, business, official former President, and Foundation/non-profit goals,"" Band writes. 
According to The Hill, Teneo's overlapping responsibilities worried some in the Clintons' inner circle, and in one email published by WikiLeaks, Chelsea Clinton raised ""serious concerns"" with Teneo's liberal use of the Clinton name to court clients. 
Band lashed out, calling the former first daughter a meddlesome ""spoiled brat"" in one hacked email released by WikiLeaks. 
""We appreciate the unorthodox nature of our roles, and the goal of seeking ways to ensure we are implementing best practices to protect the [tax exempt] status of the Foundation,"" Band wrote in his memo to justify his role and bat back criticism, The Hill reports. 
Band co-founded Teneo with former State Department employee Declan Kelly while Hillary Clinton was secretary of state ‚Äì and paid Bill Clinton as an adviser through 2012, The Hill reports. 
Band's memo lists several Teneo clients that he and Kelly ""leveraged"" into major donors for the foundation, and also details the personal introductions the two principals made between the Clintons and the prospective donors, The Hill reports. 
One that Kelly ""cultivated"" was Coca-Cola CEO Muhtar Kent, which led to seven-figure donations beginning in 2009. 
In a previous hacked email to Hillary Clinton campaign chairman John Podesta, Band worried the press might catch wind of his role and misconstrue it. 
""I'm starting to worry that if this story gets out, we are screwed,"" Band wrote. 
""[Kelly] and I built a business. Our business has almost nothing to do with the Clintons, the foundation or [the Clinton Global Initiative] in any way. The chairman of UBS could care a less [sic] about CGI."" 
A week after Band sent his memo, Clinton lawyer Cheryl Mills sent a document to Podesta and Band laying out ways to unwind the former president's charitable and business interests ‚Äî all of which distanced Band from the foundation. 
In December 2011, the former president resigned his position on Teneo‚Äôs advisory board, The Hill reports.",1
Hillary Planning Her Escape After a Trump Win With a $1.8 BILLION Money Transfer to QATAR,"Email 

It appears Bill and Hillary Clinton are making plans to flee the country in the event Donald Trump wins this election. Reports are circulating that the Clinton‚Äôs have transferred 1.8 Billion dollars from the Clinton Foundation to the Qatar Central Bank via a facilitation/abatement of JP Morgan Chase & Company for reasons not revealed. 
This move of such a large sum of money to the country of Qatar says in itself Hillary Clinton knows she is going to lose the election, and she doesn‚Äôt plan to allow her or Bill to be prosecuted for various high crimes and treason under a Trump Administration. 
The country of Qatar happens to be one of a handful of countries that does not have an extradition treaty with the United States, thus would be a perfect place for her to run to in escaping justice. 
Donald Trump has said many times during his campaign and at the Presidential debates that once he gets into office he intends to prosecute her on various high crimes from her latest crimes of sending classified material via a personal e-mail server to gun-running to terrorist groups in Syria resulting in the deaths of 4 Americans in Benghazi. 
Apparently, Hillary is not the only person in Washington who has made plans to escape justice under a Trump Administration, John Kerry has quietly been selling his property in the US for millions of dollars of late, with an announcement of the sale of his $25 million Nantucket mansion in June 2016 as well as the sale of his yacht for $3.9 million in July 2016. 
President Barack H Obama has also apparently been making exit plans with his purchase of a $4.9 million seaside mansion in Dubai in January 2016, another non extradition country. 
Snopes and other supposed fact checking sites have debunked both the story of Obama‚Äôs purchase of the mansion and the firing of Rear Admiral Rick Williams, however over the last several months these sites have been busted for lying in trying to debunk such information as the before mentioned, when in fact the information is true. Snopes and other sites try their best to keep incriminating information from being believed, but the truth has a way of coming out on its own, as it always has. 
The Bush family has been quietly buying property as well with the purchase of 100,000 acres in Paraguay in 2006, yet another country good for the Bush family, since it does not allow extradition to any country if the death penalty is a possibility for the crime. If the corruption is found to go as far back as both of the Bush Administrations with any connections to them being the perpetrators of the events on 9-11, the death penalty would surely be a stipulation of any extradition request. Apparently, if things get going with prosecuting the corrupt and treasonous, the Bush‚Äôs plan on getting out of the country as well. 
Interestingly, the Bush family‚Äôs Nazi connections dating back to WWII seem to have played a part in the Paraguay purchase since most Nazis fled to South America after WWII. Since George H. W. Bush‚Äôs father Senator Prescott Bush was director and shareholder in companies that were connected with institutions financially backing the Nazis, the Bush family has a long history of being associated with Nazis. 
With the movement of huge amounts of funds, selling millions of dollars in real estate, and the purchase of millions in real estate overseas, we are seeing the plans of the corrupt in Washington who have been ripping of our country in the trillions, murdering US citizens in the thousands, and citizens in foreign countries by the millions since 9-11 finally realizing their crimes against humanity is about to be exposed. 
We are also witnessing the change from what amounts to nothing more than a Nazi Dictatorship in Washington to an actual Presidential Administration who not only will look to the Constitution as the basis of all laws, but one who is going to prosecute the criminals in our government and return it to being a government by the people, for the people, and of the people of the USA. Not the Dictatorship over the people, to the people and who disregards the people as we now have in power.",1
"BILL CLINTON HAD SEX WITH COW DURING ‚ÄòCOCAINE PARTY‚Äô, IOWA FARMER REVEALS","Email 

Sioux Falls, IA | During his 1992 presidential campaign, Bill Clinton allegedly had sexual intercourse with cattle off of Tom Brady‚Äôs family dairy farm. 
The family farm which was owned by Tom Brady‚Äôs father at the time, Willow Brady Jr., was often visited by the Clinton family when they were in the area. 
‚ÄúMy dad and Bill Clinton‚Äôs step dad were like brothers. They often visited us on the holidays when I was a kid. Bill even knew the cows names by heart. That always surprised me‚Äù recalls the 64-year-old, third-generation dairy farmer. 
‚Äú My father was a strong Democratic party supporter all his life and a big Bill Clinton fan, so I never found the strength to tell him the truth before he passed away ‚Äù 
Sex, drugs and cattle 
During the 1992 Iowa caucus, the Clinton campaign stopped by for a night of festivities at the Brady‚Äôs farm, a night Tom Brady says he will never forget. 
‚ÄúThe Clinton team came by and we drank a lot and all was merry before they started indulging in hard drugs, that‚Äôs when everything went wrong‚Äù he recalls, visibly distraught by the whole affair. 
‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know about all those stories about him sexually assaulting women, but I sure as hell know he assaulted one of our cows because I was there and I saw him do it with my own eyes and believe me, it‚Äôs not something I‚Äôd wish my worst enemy to live to see‚Äù he told local reporters. 
‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry for the Clinton family, but as a God-fearing Christian, I just had to let the truth be known‚Äù he adds. 
Bill Clinton has been personally accused publicly by seventeen women of sexual misconduct between 1972 and 1997. The former US President also admitted to having had an ‚Äúinappropriate relationship‚Äù with Monica Lewinsky while she worked at the White House in 1995 and 1996.",1
Clinton cronies steered millions to foundation ‚Äî and Bill‚Äôs wallet,"Email 

Two Bill Clinton cronies used their private consulting firm to steer millions in business to the former president while raising funds for the Clinton Foundation ‚Äî and even called the arrangement ‚ÄúBill Clinton Inc.‚Äù 
Doug Band, a top Clinton aide, detailed the complex financial arrangement between his company, Teneo, and the foundation in a memo contained in hacked e-mails released Wednesday by WikiLeaks. 
‚ÄúTeneo partners have raised in excess of $8 million for the foundation, more than $5.25 million of which is in the bank,‚Äù the memo reads. 
‚ÄúTeneo partners also have generated over $3 million in paid speeches for President Clinton, $1.25 million of which has been paid to him thus far.‚Äù 
The consulting company was formed by Band and former State Department envoy Declan Kelly. The memo about its activities shows the incestuous relationship between the foundation and the private business interests of the former president. 
In one arrangement, Kelly introduced Bob McCann, the head of UBS Wealth Management, to Clinton at an event in 2009. 
After the meeting, McCann donated hundreds of thousands to the foundation while inviting Clinton to give several paid speeches. 
Another arrangement involved the Laureate Foundation, which donated more than $1 million to the Clinton Global Initiative. 
Laureate was a ‚Äúpersonal advisory services business,‚Äù the memo said, paying Clinton ‚Äú$3.5‚Äâmillion annually to provide advice and serve as their honorary chairman.‚Äù 
The cozy relationship with the Clintons put the Baltimore-based Laureate at high-profile events with international players who could help it expand its reach around the globe. 
The Band memo also includes a section about ‚ÄúFor-Profit Activity of President Clinton (i.e., Bill Clinton Inc.).‚Äù 
Some of the speeches ‚Äúsecured‚Äù by Teneo include two $450,000 addresses delivered to UBS in 2011 and 2012, as well as a commitment for three additional paid speeches, if he chose to give them. 
Another secured event was a $1 million fee for Clinton to speak at two one-hour sessions during an event in Hong Kong. The fee included $400,000 for a private plane. 
‚ÄúSince 2001, President Clinton‚Äôs business arrangements have yielded more than $30 million for him personally, with $66 million to be paid out over the next nine years should he choose to continue with the current engagements,‚Äù the memo reads. 
The relationship between Band and the donors was criticized harshly by daughter Chelsea Clinton in another e-mail. 
Chelsea specifically called out Band and Teneo for ‚Äúhustling‚Äô‚Äù business opportunities out of the foundation. 
‚ÄúI continue to want ‚Äî and to try ‚Äî to disintermediate myself from this muddle, edify the corporate audit and existential process we are in ‚Äî while also being a responsible board member, daughter and person,‚Äù Chelsea wrote in the 2011 e-mail. 
The relationship between foundation donors and Hillary Clinton‚Äôs State Department was raised through e-mails obtained by Citizens United in which top Hillary aide Huma Abedin appeared to vet donors‚Äô access to the Clintons based on their links to the CGI. 
In a December 2012 e-mail in which a CGI official asks for Band and a few others to meet with Hillary during a trip to Ireland, Abedin writes to Band, ‚ÄúAre these legit cgi people?‚Äù",1
"Biden Blames ‚ÄúLazy American Women‚Äù For The Economy: ‚ÄúThey Sit Around Doing Nothing, Only Hillary Can Force Them To Work‚Äù","Email 

Democratic Vice President Joe Biden wants American women to get back in the workforce to help boost the economy. ‚ÄúIf we just put all the women back to work, if they were able to afford childcare, we would increase the GDP in America by close to eight tenths of one percent,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs trillions of dollars over the next decade.‚Äù 
Biden made his remarks during a campaign event for Hillary Clinton at Chatham University in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania on Tuesday. ‚ÄúThe state of our economy could be characterized by a single word: pitiful,‚Äù he argued. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre still battling recession, I don‚Äôt care what the official stats are saying, America is still in recession. And we‚Äôre not doing anything about it.‚Äù 
He added that it was ‚Äúlazy American women‚Äù who brought about the downfall of the economy, because ‚Äúthey sit around on their behinds, doing nothing and squandering their days away when they could be improving the country that has given so much to them.‚Äù ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not sure how exactly we got to this point, but we‚Äôre here and we need to move. Like, yesterday,‚Äù he said. 
‚ÄúMark my words and mark them well,‚Äù he addressed the crowd. ‚ÄúHillary Clinton is the only one who can force American women to go to work. This is true because of a number of reasons. First, she‚Äôs a woman herself and not just any woman; she‚Äôs a self-made woman. So you better believe what she‚Äôs saying is true and has been tried and tested in practice plenty of times.‚Äù 
‚ÄúSecond, Hillary Clinton understands how difficult it can be to give up the status of a free-loader when your husband is the bread-winner of the household and the wife is expected to tend to the house, the children, make sure dinner is served and always be in the mood for marital duties. She‚Äôs been all that and she‚Äôs learned how to break free from it, the hard way, I might add,‚Äù Biden continued. 
‚ÄúToday‚Äôs women are pampered and aren‚Äôt used to rolling up their sleeves and getting the job done on their own,‚Äù the vice president said. ‚ÄúThey‚Äôre too dependent, too weak and too lazy to contribute to the economy. The reason for that is they‚Äôve learned how to manipulate men by employing one of the most fundamental laws of economics: when a sought-after commodity becomes short in supply, the demand for it rises even higher.‚Äù 
‚ÄúNow, that‚Äôs all fine and dandy when it comes to their personal interests, but if you look at the big picture, it‚Äôs the economy that‚Äôs missing out on valuable workforce. And that‚Äôs why we need to get them off their lazy behinds and get them into their workplaces. And like I said, Hillary Clinton is the only one who can do it, which is what makes her the ideal candidate for the next President of the United States. We need to heal this country, folks, not run it into the ground even deeper,‚Äù Biden concluded.",1
TRUMP CALLS FOR TEACHING ‚ÄòPATRIOTISM‚Äô IN SCHOOLS,"Email 

REPUBLICAN PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE DONALD TRUMP SIGNALED THURSDAY PLANS TO SEEK NATIONWIDE CHANGES TO SCHOOL CURRICULA WITH THE GOAL OF ‚ÄúPROMOTING AMERICAN PRIDE AND PATRIOTISM IN AMERICA‚ÄôS SCHOOLS.‚Äù 
‚ÄúIn a Trump administration, I plan to work directly with the American Legion to uphold our common values and to help ensure they are taught to America‚Äôs children,‚Äù Trump said, speaking at the American Legion‚Äôs annual convention in Cincinnati. 
‚ÄúWe want our kids to learn the incredible achievements of America‚Äôs history, its institutions and its heroes, many of whom are with us today,‚Äù he told the veterans group. 
The comments suggested a federal government intervention in the programs of locally run schools, which is prohibited under federal law‚ÄúWe will stop apologizing for America. And we will start celebrating America. We will be united by our common culture, values and principles, becoming one American nation, one country, under one Constitution, saluting one American flag, and always saluting it,‚Äù Trump said. 
Last year a Denver-area school board sought to change the content of the AP U.S. history course because some board members thought it failed to promote patriotism. 
That sparked a political proxy war in Jefferson County, Colorado, and the 2015 school board election drew nearly $1 million in campaign funding from outside interest groups. 
Public schools nationwide are funded by their local communities along with some state money. Most schools receive little federal funding. 
Current federal law prohibits the federal government from exercising ‚Äúany direction, supervision, or control over the curriculum, program of instruction, administration, or personnel of any educational institution, school, or school system.‚Äù",1

Amid Trump's increased warnings about a ""rigged election,"" 73 percent of Republicans think the election could be stolen from him, compared to 17 percent of Democrats. 
Over the past week, Trump has cast doubt on the American electoral system, saying he believes the results will be ""rigged"" at many polling places. 
""The election is absolutely being rigged by the dishonest and distorted media pushing Crooked Hillary ‚Äî but also at many polling places ‚Äî SAD,"" Trump wrote on Twitter Sunday. 
Trump has also encouraged supporters to keep an eye on voting locations to prevent fraud, which some say is a ploy to intimidate voters. 
Trump is trailing Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton in the polls following sexual assault and harassment allegations from multiple women.

WIKILEAKS: Hillary Got $12 Million for Clinton Charity As Quid Pro Quo For Morocco Meeting,"Email 
Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton arranged a $12 million donation from Moroccan King Mohammed VI to her family‚Äôs charity in 2014 in return for the Clinton Global Initiative hosting its international meeting in the North African Muslim nation, according to an email made public Thursday by Wikileaks. 
The Moroccan monarch‚Äôs funds went to the Clinton Foundation‚Äôs endowment and to CGI. The Jan. 18, 2015, email was included in Wikileaks‚Äô latest batch of communications to and from Clinton‚Äôs presidential campaign chairman, John Podesta. 
The email from Huma Abedin, Clinton‚Äôs Deputy Chief of Staff at the State Department, was addressed to Podesta and campaign manager Robby Mook. Hillary Clinton was a director of the foundation at the time. 
Singapore and Hong Kong officials reportedly were also vying to convene the CGI meeting in their countries, but the North African nation ultimately hosted it in a five-star hotel in Marrakesh, Morocco, in 2015. Abedin told Podesta and Mook that Morocco was not CGI‚Äôs ‚Äúfirst choice.‚Äù 
The actual meeting was paid for by OCP, the Moroccan-government-owned mining company that has been accused of serious human rights violations. Clinton vigorously supported the Moroccan King when she was Secretary of State and the U.S.-financed Export-Import Bank gave OCP a $92 million loan guarantee during her tenure as Secretary of State. 
The mining company also contributed between $5 million to $10 million to the Clinton Foundation, according to the charity‚Äôs web site.Abedin described the arrangement in the email as having been organized by her boss. Hillary Clinton ‚Äúcreated this mess and she knows it,‚Äù she told Podesta and Mook.She said the Moroccan deal was entirely dreamed up by her boss. ‚ÄúThis was HRC‚Äôs idea, our office approached the Moroccans and they 100 percent believe they are doing this at her request. The King has personally committed approx. $12 million both for the endowment and to support the meeting.‚Äù HRC stands for Hillary Rodham Clinton. 
Abedin said Clinton‚Äôs attendance at the CGI event was a condition of the $12 million contribution. ‚ÄúJust to give you some context, the condition upon which the Moroccans agreed to host the meeting was her participation. If hrc was not part if it, meeting was a non-starter,‚Äù Abedin said. 
Politico in 2015 reported that Clinton ‚Äúwas seen by Rabat as among its most ardent supporters in the Obama administration.‚Äù Rabat is the capital of Morocco. 
The Robert F. Kennedy Center for Justice charged OCP with ‚Äúserious human rights violations,‚Äù including exploitation of workers by not ‚Äúadequately compensating the impoverished people who live there.‚Äù 
Mohamed Yeslem Beisat, the Washington envoy for the Polisaro Front, as reported by AL-Monitor, a Middle East news site in 2015 that ‚ÄúOCP is the first beneficiary of the war and the first beneficiary of the occupation ‚Äî it is the one that is cashing in on the misery of thousands of refugees and hundreds of political detainees for the past 40 years.‚Äù 
Polisaro claims to lead a Moroccan government-in-exile based in Tindouf, Algeria. 
‚ÄúThey‚Äôre doing this because they know Hillary has some chances of being president of the United States. And they want her to support their brutal occupation of Western Sahara,‚Äù Beisat charged. 
The Moroccan firm mines phosphates. Human rights critics have called OCP‚Äôs mining product ‚Äúblood phosphates,‚Äù appropriating the term ‚Äúblood diamonds‚Äù for gems mined in operations that kill and injure local workers 
OCP is not the only mining company linked to human rights violations that has donated to the Clinton Foundation. The foundation accepted a $100 million pledge from Lukas Lundin, who owns mining and oil drilling operations in North Africa and in the Congo. (RELATED: Clinton Foundation Got $100M From ‚ÄòBlood Minerals‚Äô Firm) 
OCP retained the law firm of Covington & Burling, one of Washington‚Äôs lobbying giants, paying the firm $1.4 million in fees from 2012 to 2015. 
Stuart Eizenstat, a former White House domestic policy chief under President Carter and an influential Democratic Party insider, was the main lobbyist for the mining firm. He was also President Bill Clinton‚Äôs ambassador to the European Union, a Deputy Secretary of the Treasury and Under Secretary at the Department of Commerce. 
Eizenstat specialized in foreign trade issues at Commerce where he worked in the International Trade Administration. 
Hillary Clinton officially visited Morocco twice, in November 2009 and in February 2012, meeting with the King on both occasions. The two also met in New York in December 2013 where it was believed the two discussed Morocco‚Äôs bid to host the CGI meeting and the King‚Äôs $12 million donation. 
The Moroccan World News described the meeting as showing ‚Äúrenewed friendship between the royal family and the Clinton family, as well as Hillary Clinton‚Äôs esteem for Morocco and its people.‚Äù 
Abedin warned both campaign executives that if CGI decided to renege on the agreement, it would hurt Clinton‚Äôs relationship with the King. ‚ÄúIt will break a lot of china to back out now,‚Äù she wrote. 
Ultimately, Clinton did not attend the meeting because it was close to the launch of her presidential campaign, but the former president and daughter Chelsea were present and during the conference were guests at one of the Moroccan King‚Äôs palaces.",1
Trump warns of World War III if Clinton is elected,"Email Donald Trump warned in an interview Tuesday that Hillary Clinton's policies as president to address the Syrian conflict would lead to World War III, arguing the Democratic nominee would draw the US into armed confrontation with Russia, Syria and Iran. ""What we should do is focus on ISIS. We should not be focusing on Syria,"" Trump told Reuters on Tuesday morning at his resort in Doral, Florida. ""You're going to end up in World War III over Syria if we listen to Hillary Clinton."" The Republican nominee, who has called for a rapprochement with Russia in order to jointly combat ISIS, argued that his Democratic rival's calls for taking a more aggressive posture in Syria to bring the conflict there to an end and combat ISIS will only draw the US into a larger war. Trump's remarks come as he trails Clinton in most national and key battleground state polls just two weeks from Election Day. ""You're not fighting Syria anymore, you're fighting Syria, Russia and Iran, all right? Russia is a nuclear country, but a country where the nukes work as opposed to other countries that talk,"" he said. Trump: I'd 'love' to fight Biden Trump has not laid out a clear strategy for combating ISIS or addressing the globally destabilizing conflict in Syria, which has killed hundreds of thousands and pushed millions more to flee their homes. He has suggested the US should allow ISIS, anti-government rebels and the Syrian government to fight it out and more recently has focused on joining forces with Russia -- which has aided the Syrian regime in the bombing of civilians and US-allied rebels -- to combat ISIS. ""Assad is secondary, to me, to ISIS,"" Trump told Reuters of the Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, whom US officials have argued must step down. Clinton has called for establishing a no-fly zone over Syria to help bring the five-year civil war to an end, a proposal top Republicans in Congress have championed, which President Barack Obama and others have opposed due to the risk of entering into conflict with Russia. A US-enforced no-fly zone would mean the US could shoot down a Russian jet should it enter Syrian airspace. Clinton addressed those concerns in the final presidential debate, arguing that it would ""save lives and hasten the end of the conflict,"" while cautioning that ""this would not be done just on the first day."" ""This would take a lot of negotiation and it would also take making it clear to the Russians and the Syrians that our purpose is to provide safe zones on the ground,"" Clinton said during the debate earlier this month. ""I think we could strike a deal and make it very clear to the Russians and Syrians that this was something that we believe the best interests of the people on the ground in Syria. It would help us in the fight against ISIS."" Trump has additionally called for establishing safe zones in Syria to protect civilians -- as has Clinton -- which could also put the US in conflict with the Syrian government or Russia should they oppose the policy. The Clinton campaign later Tuesday pushed back against Trump's rhetoric. ""National security experts on both sides of the aisle have denounced Donald Trump as dangerously ill-prepared and temperamentally unfit to serve as commander-in-chief,"" Clinton spokesman Jesse Lehrich said. ""Once again, he is parroting Putin's talking points and playing to Americans' fears, all while refusing to lay out any plans of his own for defeating ISIS or alleviating humanitarian suffering in Syria. Moreover, this incendiary attack is aimed at a policy that his own running mate, Mike Pence, strongly supports."" Poll: Most see a Hillary Clinton victory and a fair count ahead While Clinton has accused Trump of being Putin's ""puppet,"" Trump knocked Clinton for her criticism of the Russian strongman, asking, ""How she is going to go back and negotiate with this man who she has made to be so evil."" And just two days after he tied the successful enactment of his agenda as president to the election of Republican majorities in Congress, Trump also returned to his more typical complaints of a lack of Republican unity weighing down his candidacy. ""If we had party unity, we couldn't lose this election to Hillary Clinton,"" he told Reuters. That complaint didn't put Trump in more of a bipartisan mood, though, as the Republican nominee also told Reuters he would not consider putting any Democrats in his cabinet -- a departure from recent presidents, who have sought to post at least one member of their rival party in a top administration post.",1
Obama slams Trump's 'rigged' election claims as 'dangerous',"Email President Barack Obama admonished Donald Trump Thursday, saying the Republican nominee's claims that he might not accept the results of next month's election are ""not a joking matter."" ""I want everybody to pay attention here. This is dangerous,"" Obama said at a Hillary for America event in Miami Gardens, Florida. ""Because when you try to sow the seeds of doubt in people's mind about the legitimacy of our elections, that undermines our democracy. Then you are doing the work of our adversaries for them."" Obama also encouraged the crowd of about 1,800 at Florida Memorial University to take advantage of Florida's early voting, telling the audience in doing so they can reject what the President called Trump's ""dark, pessimistic fear-mongering."" ""Our democracy depends on people knowing that their vote matters. That those who occupy the seats of power were chosen by the people,"" Obama said. On Wednesday night's debate Trump, answered, ""I will look at it at the time,"" when asked whether he would concede if he loses on November 8. ""I will keep you in suspense."" Trump also doubled down on Thursday in Ohio saying he will accept the results of next month's election as long as wins. Obama also used the opportunity while in Florida to weigh in on the close Senate race in Florida between Republican Sen. Marco Rubio and his Democratic challenger, Rep. Patrick Murphy. ""Even Marco Rubio says there's no rigging of the vote,"" Obama said, ""Which I'd like to give credit for, except he's refuting the dangerous, unprecedented claims of a candidate he says he's still going to vote for!"" Earlier this week, Obama released a new ad for the Democrat in the Sunshine State, the same week it was announced the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee was puling money for ads for Murphy.",1
Donald Trump claims the election will be 'rigged' ‚Äî and critics have called that preposterous and dangerous,"Email 
Donald Trump is again riling up his voting base with claims that the November election will be rigged against him. 
""Of course there is large scale voter fraud happening on and before election day,"" Trump tweeted Monday morning. ""Why do Republican leaders deny what is going on? So naive!"" 
It's a charge that even other Republicans have been quick to refute. Critics have called such talk potentially dangerous and detrimental to trust in the US democratic process. 
""States, backed by tens of thousands of GOP and DEM volunteers, ensure integrity of electoral process,"" Sen. Jeff Flake of Arizona, who is often sharply critical of Trump, tweeted Sunday. ""Elections are not rigged."" 
Jon Husted, the secretary of state of Ohio and the top election official in the key battleground state, also said Monday that he could assure Trump the election would not be rigged. 
Trump's most recent claims coincided with a plunge by him in the polls. Before now, Trump most recently made similar claims when his polls numbers were taking a dive in early August. 
""And I'm telling you, November 8, we'd better be careful, because that election is going to be rigged,"" the New York billionaire told Fox News host Sean Hannity in August. ""And I hope the Republicans are watching closely or it's going to be taken away from us."" 
Multiple Republicans told Business Insider at the time that Trump's assertion was both ludicrous and dangerous, as Trump would be the first US presidential candidate in modern times, possibly ever, to blame an election loss on voter fraud or a rigged election. 
Allen Raymond, a former GOP operative who was involved in the 2002 New Hampshire Senate election phone-jamming scandal, called Trump's continued insistence that the election would be rigged ""detrimental to the Republic."" 
""The idea that it's rigged, I don't know what he's talking about,"" he said in August. ""I know someone that rigged elections. I mean, you know, the fact of the matter is Hillary Clinton doesn't need to rig this election. Trump's going to win Alabama and that's it. She doesn't have to do anything. It's painful to watch."" 
Raymond wrote ""How to Rig an Election: Confessions of a Republican Operative"" as a tell-all about the attempt to rig the 2002 New Hampshire Senate election between then-Gov. Jeanne Shaheen, a Democrat, and Republican US Rep. John E. Sununu. Raymond said that attempted rigging was centered on jamming the phone lines at the New Hampshire Democrats office in Manchester ‚Äî a task his phone bank was hired to carry out. Sununu went on to win the election by roughly 20,000 votes. Shaheen defeated Sununu in a rematch in 2008. 
The operative served a brief prison sentence for his involvement.He said any attempts to rig an election would look similar to that ‚Äî not what Trump's talking about. 
The Manhattan billionaire told The Washington Post in August that a lack of voter-identification laws would let people ""just keep voting and voting and voting"" and suggested fraud occurred in 2012 against Republican nominee Mitt Romney because there were ""precincts where there were practically nobody voting for the Republican."" 
""I don't even know what he's talking about,"" Raymond said. ""But this idea that it's 1950 or 1960 and the party bosses are going to roll into Pittsburgh and Philadelphia and are going to rig the ballot box and rig the machines ‚Äî that's nonsense. An election rigging these days means something totally different than what he's talking about. Now it's stupid stuff like what I did in New Hampshire."" 
He said the lack of voter-ID laws Trump was trying to use as proof of fraud this fall was also bogus. 
""These voter-ID laws, what's the intention of that? The clear intention is disenfranchisement,"" he said, echoing a common complaint in liberal circles that voter-ID laws are put in place to prevent minority voting blocks from being able to cast ballots. ""You know, there's a reason we don't have a poll tax anymore. Because it's unconstitutional. 
""People don't vote 10 times,"" he continued. ""There might be one bad actor every once in a while who tries to vote a couple of times, but he's talking about an institutional effort. It's a total myth."" 
He said Trump's statements were an attempt to ""basically sideline"" Hillary Clinton's first four years in office. 
The idea of a rigged election came to the forefront after the Democratic National Committee had its emails hacked and leaked, though both Trump and Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont, Clinton's main opponent in the Democratic primary, had claimed the electoral system was rigged earlier in the primary season. The emails showed that the organization, which was supposed to remain neutral throughout the primary, favored Clinton. 
Trump said the email leak proved that the primary election was ""rigged"" against Sanders in his early-August interview with Hannity, in addition to such claims he perpetuated along the campaign trail. He used the leak as further evidence that the fall election would be rigged against him as well.",1
Trump: Hillary Clinton may be 'most corrupt person ever' to run for president,"Email 
Donald Trump‚Äôs campaign debuted a dark new attack ad on Tuesday, looking to further its portrayal of Hillary Clinton as a corrupt politician and doubling down on allegations that she grew wealthy through ‚Äúpay-to-play politics.‚ÄùThe TV spot hits Clinton, the Democratic presidential nominee, on controversies related to her family‚Äôs foundation, stating that ‚Äústaggering amounts of cash poured into the Clinton Foundation from criminals, dictators, countries that hate America‚Äù and that ‚ÄúHillary cut deals for donors.‚Äù 
Clinton‚Äôs charitable foundation has faced intense scrutiny this election over concerns about possible conflicts of interest because it took in money from corporations and foreign governments. Clinton has repeatedly denied, however, that her work as secretary of state was compromised by the foundation‚Äôs work or that she gave any special privileges to its donors.The Clintons have also said that the foundation, which contributes to AIDS relief abroad, among other charitable causes, will cease taking money from corporations and foreign governments if she is elected president.Still, the ad from the Republican nominee claims that Clinton ‚Äúsold out American workers, exploited Haitians in need, she even gave American uranium rights to the Russians.‚Äù‚ÄúHillary Clinton only cares about power, money and herself,‚Äù its voice over concludes.The advertisement is another instance of Trump, an embattled candidate in an already divisive race, going on the offensive as the presidential campaign enters its final weeks. As Trump trails in the polls and high-profile Republicans abandon him, he has attacked Clinton and her husband‚Äôs character, going so far as to bring women who had accused Bill Clinton of sexual misconduct to watch the second debate in St. Louis last weekend.Some Republicans had called for him to drop out of the race after a 2005 recording emerged showing him bragging about sexual assault last week. But, attacking even Republican establishment figures like Speaker Paul Ryan and Arizona Sen.

Trump says he‚Äôd be ‚Äòneutral‚Äô with Israelis and Palestinians,"Email 
Leading Republican presidential hopeful suggests Israeli-Palestinian peace accord may be impossible: ‚ÄòSometimes agreements can‚Äôt be made‚ÄôAfter being asked by a voter at a Charleston, South Carolina, town hall event hosted by MSNBC about what steps he would take to broker an accommodation between the sides in the conflict, the GOP contender vowed to give it ‚Äúone hell of a shot‚Äù and called it ‚Äúprobably the toughest agreement of any kind to make.‚ÄùBut when pressed by host Joe Scarborough over whether he ascribed fault to either Israelis or Palestinians over the failure to reach a lasting accord, Trump declined to take sides. 
‚ÄúYou know, I don‚Äôt want to get into it, because ‚Ä¶ If I win, I don‚Äôt want to be in a position where I‚Äôm saying to you and the other side now says, ‚ÄòWe don‚Äôt want Trump involved,'‚Äù Trump said. 
‚ÄúLet me be sort of a neutral guy,‚Äù he continued. ‚ÄúA lot of people have gone down in flames trying to make that deal. So I don‚Äôt want to say whose fault is it. I don‚Äôt think it helps.‚ÄùTrump also expressed skepticism over the possibility of achieving a two-state solution, given the conditions of the conflict and the need for any agreement to be sustainable over time. 
‚ÄúIt‚Äôs possible it‚Äôs not makeable, because don‚Äôt forget it has to last ‚Äî it‚Äôs wonderful to make it and it doesn‚Äôt work, but it has to last,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúTo make lasting peace there? Probably the toughest deal of all, but I‚Äôm going to give it a shot.‚Äù 
Though he was not asked directly what he considers the most substantial obstacles standing in the way of a peace agreement, he suggested that growing hostility between the two peoples was contributing to the current stalemate, and what he considers the root of the conflict. 
‚ÄúA lot of people say an agreement can‚Äôt be made, which is okay. I mean, sometimes agreements can‚Äôt be made. Not good, but, you know, you have both sides really, but one side in particular, growing up and learning that these are the worst people,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúI was with a very prominent Israeli the other day. He says it‚Äôs impossible, because the other side has been trained from the time they‚Äôre children to hate Jewish people.‚ÄùIn the past, Trump has questioned Israel‚Äôs commitment to peace, while at the same time suggesting the Jewish state does not have a negotiating partner in the Palestinians. He has also called Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu ‚Äúa good friend.‚Äù 
At a presidential candidates forum hosted by the Republican Jewish Coalition in December 2015, the real estate magnate said, ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know that Israel has the commitment to make it, and I don‚Äôt know that the other side has the commitment to make it.‚Äù 
He made the same point in an interview with AP earlier that day: ‚ÄúA lot will have to do with Israel and whether or not Israel wants to make the deal ‚Äî whether or not Israel‚Äôs willing to sacrifice certain things,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúThey may not be, and I understand that, and I‚Äôm okay with that. But then you‚Äôre just not going to have a deal.‚Äù 
Trump‚Äôs comments Wednesday came hours after a dramatic upset in polls saw Trump fall behind Texas Sen. Ted Cruz for the first time in 31 consecutive polls, coming in at 26% of registered Republican voters nationally, two points behind Cruz at 28%.",1
Donald Trump threatens to jail Hillary Clinton,"Email 
The second presidential debate flew off the rails on Sunday night when Donald Trump invoked accusations of sexual misconduct against Bill Clinton and suggested that Hillary Clinton could ""be in jail"" if he's elected in November, threatening to appoint a special prosecutor to look into her private email server. 

ABC's Martha Raddatz, one of the debate moderators, asked Trump whether his behavior exposed in the shocking 2005 video released Friday, in which he bragged about groping and kissing women without permission, was consistent with his current behavior. 
""As I told you, that was locker-room talk,"" Trump said. ""I am not proud of it. I am a person who has great respect for people, for my family, for people of this country, and I'm not proud of it."" 
Trump then said if you ""look at the history of politics in this country, no one had been so abusive of women"" as former President Bill Clinton, the husband of the Democratic nominee, whom Trump suggested intimidated those women. 
Three women who had previously accused Bill Clinton of sexual misconduct held a press conference with Trump earlier Sunday, and each was seated in the front row at the debate. 
""Mine were words ‚Äî his were actions,"" Trump said. 
""So, don't tell me about words,"" he continued. ""I am absolutely, I apologize for those words. But it is things that people say. Bill Clinton. He was impeached. He was no longer allowed to practice law. He had to pay an $850,000 fine to one of the women, Paula Jones, who is here tonight. That when Hillary brings up a point like that, brings up words I say 11 years ago, I think it's disgraceful. And I think she should be ashamed of herself, if you want to know the truth.""

‚Äî CNN Politics (@CNNPolitics) October 10, 2016The former secretary of state responded by saying that ""so much of what he just said is not right"" but that he was doing it because of his floundering campaign. 
""I am reminded of what my friend Michelle Obama advised us all,"" she said. ""When they go low, you go high."" 
""And, look, if this were just about one video, maybe what he's saying tonight would be understandable,"" she said. ""But everyone can come to their own conclusions about whether or not the man in the video or the man on the stage respects women. But he never apologizes to anyone for anything."" 
She mentioned that Trump had not apologized to the Khans, a couple who lost a son, a Muslim US soldier, during the Iraq War. Trump engaged in a lengthy back-and-forth with the Khans after they appeared at the Democratic National Convention in July. 
Clinton also said Trump had not apologized to a reporter whose disability he mocked in front of a camera, a federal judge who Trump said couldn't do his job fairly because he was of Mexican descent, and President Barack Obama, whose birthplace Trump tried to discredit in a multiyear campaign. 
""He owes the president an apology, he needs to apologize to our country, and he needs to take responsibility,"" she said. 
Trump responded by repeating the false claim that the Clinton campaign started the rumors casting doubt on Obama's birthplace in 2008. He added that she owed an apology for the ""33,000 emails you deleted."" 
""If I win, I am going to instruct my attorney general to get a special prosecutor to look into your situation,"" Trump said. ""Because there have never been so many lies, so much deception. And we're going to have a special prosecutor."" 
Clinton said everything Trump said was ""absolutely false"" but she was ""not surprised."" 
""Oh really?"" Trump interjected. 
Clinton then mentioned the difficulty in fact-checking Trump, to which he capped off the exchange by saying ""you'd be in jail"" during his potential administration.",1

Hillary: ‚ÄúWe Did Not Lose A Single Important Person In Libya‚Äù,"Email 

Hillary Clinton declared during NBC News‚Äôs Commander-in-Chief forum that no lives were lost in Libya when she made the move to take out dictator Muammar Gaddafi. Even so, the former secretary of state did not mention the fact that 11 months later four Americans ‚Äì including U.S. Ambassador Christopher Stevens ‚Äì were killed in a terrorist attack in Benghazi that arose from the instability that the overthrow created. 
‚ÄúThat was one of the few situations in American foreign policy decision making processes where everybody came together to make sure we don‚Äôt make the wrong move, and the operation was a success, even Donald Trump supported it,‚Äù Clinton argued. ‚ÄúAs with any operation of such magnitude, we had a few hiccups, but it was nothing out of the ordinary. As I‚Äôve said, the operation was a success.‚Äù 
She continued, ‚ÄúSo much so, in fact, that I‚Äôm proud to say that no important people were lost through it all, and when I say that, I say it with the utmost respect for all those who had to give their lives on both sides so that Libyans could be freed from the iron fist of Gaddafi. It would have been unrealistic to expect 0 casualties; however, the overall toll did not exceed expectations, with the greater amount of damage being on the side of the enemy.‚Äù 
‚ÄúPolitics can be a cruel line of work. That being said, I stand before you here, today, and I am proud to say that giving democracy to a people that have not had any contact with it for generations is a wonderful thing that makes all of the sacrifices worth it. And while we‚Äôre on the subject of sacrifices, thank God they did not include anyone important from the American delegation, including yours truly,‚Äù she said jokingly, causing the auditorium to laugh. 
She said, ‚ÄúBut all jokes aside, I have to pay homage to the CIA, who has once again performed outstandingly and saved the day. Its agents‚Äô work in the field is an immeasurable contribution and an asset that we would be wise to treasure for generations to come. If it hadn‚Äôt been for them, we would not have been able to perform the operation so cleanly and with such little impact to the surrounding nations. I am proud that the United States of America has an intelligence agency such as the CIA.‚Äù 
‚ÄúI‚Äôm sure many here among you disagree with my position that one embassy is a small price to pay, a bargain, if you will, when it comes to ridding the world of another dictator and a terrorist. I would also like to remind everyone here that that price would have gone up immeasurably if we had sat idly by and allowed Gaddafi to rage on and cause death and destruction throughout the region. For better of worse, we acted and I am convinced no other dictator will ever again think about cheating the CIA out of a deal. Because, in the words of a personal friend of mine, who is a former CIA spook ‚Äì shutting down arms dealers is easy; finding trustworthy partners among nation heads is the hard part,‚Äù she concluded.",1
"ISIS uses an industrial dough kneader to kill 250 children, roasts adults in a bakery oven in Douma, Syria","Email 
ISIS barbarians used an industrial dough kneader to kill 250 children, and roasted adults in a bakery oven, according to a shocking new report. 
In an interview with the humanitarian organization Roads of Success, Syrian mom Alice Assaf went into chilling detail about the atrocities the jihadists committed about two years ago in the town of Douma, explaining that some of the youngsters were even decapitated in front of their parents, according to the Express. 
‚ÄúWe heard that the militants grabbed six strong men working at the bakery and burned them inside the oven. We knew them,‚Äù Assaf told Dr. Yvette Isaac, who works for the advocacy group, according to the UK Mirror. 
‚ÄúAfter that, they caught some 250 kids and kneaded them like dough in the bakery dough machine,‚Äù Assaf said, according to media reports. ‚ÄúThey were put in the dough mixer, they were kneaded. The oldest one of them was four-years-old.‚Äù 
ISIS transported hundreds of girls to the city of Douma, which has been at the center of the Syrian civil war, to be slaughtered. ISIS has been systematically killing non-Muslims, and the majority of its victims at the time were Christian. 
Assaf said her own son, George, was killed by the radical militants after he refused to switch to a Muslim name. 
‚ÄúMy son said to me, ‚ÄòNo, mother, I don‚Äôt want to die with an identity not my own. I prefer to die with the name George,'‚Äù Assaf said, according to the Christian Post. 
Assaf added, ‚ÄúI asked my son then to hide, but he refused and said, ‚ÄòI don‚Äôt want to hide myself. You are the one who taught me to follow what Christ said‚Äô ‚Äî ‚Äòwhoever denies me before man, I will also deny before my father who is in Heaven.'‚Äù 
Dr. Isaac reported the savage slayings to a member of the UK Parliament, Fiona Bruce, who recently recounted the horrifying testimony to her colleagues in open chambers. 
‚ÄúShe showed us recent film footage of herself talking with mothers‚Äìmore than one‚Äì who had seen their own children crucified,‚Äù Bruce said.

3 Charlotte Area Counties Report Voting Machines Picking Wrong Candidates,"MecklenburgCatawba 
The complaints noted that the machines wrongly identified a voter‚Äôs choice, but in all reported cases, the voters were able to correct their ballots before casting them. 
‚ÄúTo my knowledge, at this point, we don‚Äôt have any cases where elections officials noted significant problems with any machines based on these complaints. Of course they‚Äôre all looked into and that‚Äôs why we encourage people to immediately flag down an election official,‚Äù commented Gannon. 
The NC State Board Of Election released the following statement regarding the complaints: 
The N.C. State Board of Elections is aware that some voters have contacted advocacy groups or elections officials with concerns about touch-screen voting machines in several counties. 
Similar reports have been made in recent elections, and we take them very seriously. 
We want to ensure voters that safeguards are in place to ensure touch-screen machines accurately record voters‚Äô selections. 
Touch-screen machines are tested thoroughly before each election. They are recalibrated daily before voting begins to test and ensure accuracy. If a voter notices an issue with selection accuracy of a machine, they should raise their hand and notify an election official immediately. If needed, the machine may be taken out of service for recalibration, and the voter may be moved to a different machine. 
Also, each touch-screen machine prompts voters to review their selections before casting their ballot. As with paper ballots, voters should check over their selections to ensure accuracy prior to casting their ballot. On touch-screen machines, voters also can review a real-time audit log that records all of their selections. 
‚ÄúWe urge all voters to carefully review their selections before casting their ballots, and to immediately report any questions or concerns to elections officials,‚Äù said Kim Westbrook Strach, executive director of the N.C. State Board of Elections.",1

As far as how the media treats Hillary Clinton, if you‚Äôve noticed, they treat her like a queen. The liberal media likes to pamper, lie, and make sure America knows she is the best option. We, however, know better. So does Jason Chaffetz. 
For those of you who do it know who Chaffetz is, he is the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform Chairman who famously told the guy who destroyed Hillary‚Äôs email server that he was served on live TV. Now he just served up a brutal threat to Hillary Clinton and she is running scared.

WikiLeaks: Email Proves Democrats Manipulate Polls,"Email 

An email published by WikiLeaks on Friday reveals the extent to which Democrats and their allies manipulate polls to serve their ends. 
The 2008 email appears shows Democratic operatives plotting to intentionally oversample seniors in a poll in order to get their desired results. 
‚ÄúFYI: We are going to try to do an oversample of seniors on the poll. Sample too small otherwise,‚Äù operative Tom Matzzie wrote to Clinton adviser Paul Begala, campaign Chairman John Podesta, Media Matters for America founder David Brock, and operative Susan McCue. ‚ÄúGood,‚Äù Begala responded. 
Trump and his supporters have claimed often that many polls showing a significant Hillary lead over Trump have been manipulated through selective sampling. There is ample evidence that this occurs in Democrat-friendly newsrooms. 
‚ÄúHillary Clinton has opened up a 7-point lead over Donald Trump in an online poll that seems to reflect a ‚Äòbounce‚Äô for the former secretary of state after she wrapped up the Democratic nomination last week,‚Äù the Daily Mail reported in June. 
""But the weekly tracking poll, from NBC News and the Surveymonkey company, included the opinions of 7 percent more self-identified Democrats than Republicans ‚Äì the same margin as the poll's topline result,"" the article noted. 
The email released by WikiLeaks Friday proves that Democratic operatives themselves engage eagerly in such tactics. 
Polls are a powerful propaganda tool, and people exposed repeatedly to polls suggesting their candidate's loss is a foregone conclusion will often be influenced to stay home on Election Day. 
""I think sometimes polling is done to dampen election turnout,"" Rand Paul said in an interview on Wednesday on ""The Tom Roten Show"" out of West Virginia. ""When we say over and over someone can't win that is a form of rigging in the sense that it is designed to suppress turnout,"" he added.",1

"ISIS uses an industrial dough kneader to kill 250 children, roasts adults in a bakery oven in Douma, Syria","Email 
ISIS barbarians used an industrial dough kneader to kill 250 children, and roasted adults in a bakery oven, according to a shocking new report. 
In an interview with the humanitarian organization Roads of Success, Syrian mom Alice Assaf went into chilling detail about the atrocities the jihadists committed about two years ago in the town of Douma, explaining that some of the youngsters were even decapitated in front of their parents, according to the Express. 
‚ÄúWe heard that the militants grabbed six strong men working at the bakery and burned them inside the oven. We knew them,‚Äù Assaf told Dr. Yvette Isaac, who works for the advocacy group, according to the UK Mirror. 
‚ÄúAfter that, they caught some 250 kids and kneaded them like dough in the bakery dough machine,‚Äù Assaf said, according to media reports. ‚ÄúThey were put in the dough mixer, they were kneaded. The oldest one of them was four-years-old.‚Äù 
ISIS transported hundreds of girls to the city of Douma, which has been at the center of the Syrian civil war, to be slaughtered. ISIS has been systematically killing non-Muslims, and the majority of its victims at the time were Christian. 
Assaf said her own son, George, was killed by the radical militants after he refused to switch to a Muslim name. 
‚ÄúMy son said to me, ‚ÄòNo, mother, I don‚Äôt want to die with an identity not my own. I prefer to die with the name George,'‚Äù Assaf said, according to the Christian Post. 
Assaf added, ‚ÄúI asked my son then to hide, but he refused and said, ‚ÄòI don‚Äôt want to hide myself. You are the one who taught me to follow what Christ said‚Äô ‚Äî ‚Äòwhoever denies me before man, I will also deny before my father who is in Heaven.'‚Äù 
Dr. Isaac reported the savage slayings to a member of the UK Parliament, Fiona Bruce, who recently recounted the horrifying testimony to her colleagues in open chambers. 
‚ÄúShe showed us recent film footage of herself talking with mothers‚Äìmore than one‚Äì who had seen their own children crucified,‚Äù Bruce said. 
‚ÄúShe told us of a mother with a two-month-old baby. When [ISIS] knocked at the front door of her house and ordered the entire family out, she pleaded with them to let her collect her child from another room,‚Äù Bruce said.

"'If Trump loses, I'm grabbing my musket,' former congressman tweets","Email 

Former Illinois congressman and conservative radio host Joe Walsh appeared to invite armed insurrection when he tweeted that he was ""grabbing his musket"" if Hillary Clinton defeats Donald Trump in the presidential election. 
""On November 8th, I'm voting for Trump,"" Walsh tweeted. ""On November 9th, if Trump loses, I'm grabbing my musket."" 
""@WalshFreedom what exactly does that mean?"" CNN's Jake Tapper tweeted in reply. 
""@jaketapper It means protesting,"" Walsh tweeted. ""Participating in acts of civil disobedience. Doing what it takes to get our country back."" 
Walsh's rhetoric comes as Americans are already nervous about what will happen on and after Election Day. Trump's insistence that the election is ""rigged,"" and his statement at the last debate that he would keep America ""in suspense"" about whether or not he will accept the results, have left some in fear that violence could flare up if his supporters refuse to accept the outcome. 
More than half of Americans expressed concern about violence on election day according to a USA TODAY/Suffolk University poll released Wednesday. 
Walsh dismissed another Twitter user's concern that his call to arms could draw the attention of the Secret Service saying, ""They understand that a musket hasn't been used in battle in almost 200 years."" 
""I'm serious,"" Walsh tweeted later. ""I don't think a musket would do much good these days, but it's time for civil disobedience on the right."" 
Walsh repeated his defense that he was only speaking of civil disobedience to NBC's Chicago affiliate. ""We're talking about a musket,"" Walsh said, according to NBC 5 Chicago. ""I could've said grab your slingshot and let's go. Metaphorically, I meant grab your muskets, if Trump loses, man, we're going to do what we have to do. We're going to protest and boycott and practice civil disobedience. We may start a third party."" 
This wasn't the first time Walsh, who served one term before being defeated by Rep. Tammy Duckworth in 2012, drew criticism for an incendiary tweet. In July he got national attention for telling President Obama to ""watch out"" after five police officers were killed by a shooter in Dallas. 
""3 Dallas Cops killed, 7 wounded,"" Walsh tweeted in a post that has since been deleted. ""This is now war. Watch out Obama. Watch out black lives matter punks. Real America is coming after you.""",1

It‚Äôs no mystery that Bill Clinton is a sexual deviant, but the most recent account given by the woman who had a 3-decade affair with the man is damning, to say the least.

The connection between Dolly and Bill began when she was just 11-years-old. He was about 13-years-old at the time, but Dolly states that there was an immediate attraction, even then.

The real affair began in 1974 just after Dolly divorced her first husband, and although Bill wasn‚Äôt married yet, he would be within the year. Although she was never interested in sharing the intimate details of the relationship, she states that she snapped when she heard Hillary recently say that all sexual assault victims have the ‚Äúright to be believed.‚Äù

According to Mail Online, Bill approached Dolly at their high school‚Äôs 35-year reunion to talk about ‚Äú the warden‚Äù ‚Äì a.k.a. Hillary. Saying he was unhappy with his life and marriage, this was the least significant account Dolly had to share. 
In fact, Dolly recalls that Bill mentioned something about having a baby to her. Although she thought he was saying he wanted to have one with her, he was actually talking about Hillary. He wanted to put to bed the rumors that Hillary was a lesbian, even though everyone in their hometown already knew it to be true. 
Dolly states that the worst came when she met Hillary for the first time. ‚ÄúIn that moment I noticed that the woman emitted an overpowering [body] odor of perspiration and greasy hair.

"FEAR OF TRUMP: BUSH, OBAMA, CLINTON ALL BUYING PROPERTY IN NON-EXTRADITION NATIONS","Email 

It appears Bill and Hillary Clinton are making plans to flee the country in the event Donald Trump wins this election. 
Reports are circulating that the Clintons have transferred 1.8 Billion dollars from the Clinton Foundation to the Qatar Central Bank, via a facilitation/abatement of JP Morgan Chase & Company for reasons not revealed. 
This move of such a large sum of money to the country of Qatar says in itself, Hillary Clinton knows she is going to lose the election, and she doesn‚Äôt plan to allow herself to be prosecuted for various high crimes and treason under a Trump Administration. 
The country of Qatar happens to be one of a handful of countries that does not have an extradition treaty with the United States, thus would be a perfect place for her to run to in escaping justice. 
Donald Trump has said many times during his campaign and at the Presidential debates that once he gets into office, he intends to prosecute her on various high crimes from her latest crimes of sending classified material via a personal e mail server. All the way to gun running to terrorist groups in Syria resulting in the deaths of 4 Americans in Benghazi. 
Apparently, Hillary is not the only person in Washington who has made plans to escape justice under a Trump Administration. John Kerry has quietly been selling his property in the US for millions of dollars of late, with an announcement of the sale of his $25 million dollar Nantucket mansion in June 2016, as well as the sale of his yacht for $3.9 million in July 2016. 
President Barack H Obama has also apparently been making exit plans with his purchase of a $4.9 million dollar seaside mansion in Dubai in January 2016, another non extradition country. 
Snopes and other supposed fact checking sites have debunked both the story of Obama‚Äôs purchase of the mansion and the firing of Rear Admiral Rick Williams. However, over the last several months, these sites have been busted for lying in trying to debunk such information as the before mentioned, when in fact the information is true.

Reddit, which describes itself as ‚Äúa source for what‚Äôs new and popular on the web‚Äù is divided into thousands of ‚Äúsubreddits,‚Äù which the site describes as ‚Äúsub-communities, each focused on a specific topic.‚Äù 
Whether or not a post does well on Reddit (and, consequently, how large of an audience it reaches) largely depends on how many ‚Äúupvotes‚Äù and ‚Äúdownvotes‚Äù it receives.",1
"FEAR OF TRUMP: BUSH, OBAMA, CLINTON ALL BUYING PROPERTY IN NON-EXTRADITION NATIONS","Email 

It appears Bill and Hillary Clinton are making plans to flee the country in the event Donald Trump wins this election. 
Reports are circulating that the Clintons have transferred 1.8 Billion dollars from the Clinton Foundation to the Qatar Central Bank, via a facilitation/abatement of JP Morgan Chase & Company for reasons not revealed. 
This move of such a large sum of money to the country of Qatar says in itself, Hillary Clinton knows she is going to lose the election, and she doesn‚Äôt plan to allow herself to be prosecuted for various high crimes and treason under a Trump Administration. 
The country of Qatar happens to be one of a handful of countries that does not have an extradition treaty with the United States, thus would be a perfect place for her to run to in escaping justice. 
Donald Trump has said many times during his campaign and at the Presidential debates that once he gets into office, he intends to prosecute her on various high crimes from her latest crimes of sending classified material via a personal e mail server. All the way to gun running to terrorist groups in Syria resulting in the deaths of 4 Americans in Benghazi. 
Apparently, Hillary is not the only person in Washington who has made plans to escape justice under a Trump Administration. John Kerry has quietly been selling his property in the US for millions of dollars of late, with an announcement of the sale of his $25 million dollar Nantucket mansion in June 2016, as well as the sale of his yacht for $3.9 million in July 2016. 
President Barack H Obama has also apparently been making exit plans with his purchase of a $4.9 million dollar seaside mansion in Dubai in January 2016, another non extradition country. 
Snopes and other supposed fact checking sites have debunked both the story of Obama‚Äôs purchase of the mansion and the firing of Rear Admiral Rick Williams. However, over the last several months, these sites have been busted for lying in trying to debunk such information as the before mentioned, when in fact the information is true. 
Snopes and other sites try their best to keep incriminating information from being believed, but the truth has a way of coming out on its own, as it always has.",1
Jackie Mason: Hillary Clinton Too Untrustworthy To Serve As Bathroom Attendant ‚Äì She‚Äôd Steal The Toilet Paper,"Email 

During a radio interview, comic legend and political pundit Jackie Mason joked that the only time Hillary Clinton is not lying ‚Äúis when her mouth is not moving.‚Äù‚ÄúAnd even then, she is probably lying because she‚Äôs probably sitting there thinking of the next lie she is going to tell,‚Äù he added. 
Mason claimed that Clinton is so untrustworthy that she likely couldn‚Äôt land a job as an ‚Äúattendant in the ladies‚Äô room because they would be afraid that she would steal the towels or the napkins. Even the toilet paper wouldn‚Äôt be safe from her.‚Äù 
Mason was speaking during his regular segment on this reporter‚Äôs talk radio program, ‚ÄúAaron Klein Investigative Radio,‚Äù broadcast on New York‚Äôs AM 970 The Answer and NewsTalk 990 AM in Philadelphia. 
He continued: 
Do you think that if she went for any other job besides the presidency that anyone would hire her anywhere? If you saw her resume which is a resume of accomplishing nothing and running from the police three-quarters of her life. She is always either indicted or almost indicted or about to be indicted. Her whole life spent fleeing from the Justice Departments of different countries. Now, this yenta, do you think she would be able to get any other job? ‚Ä¶ 
Would you think they would hire her as a chambermaid? Do you know what all those sheets and pillowcases are worth? Do you think they would trust her with it? After they found out the history of her life. Let‚Äôs be honest about it, if you went on a vacation would you let her watch your house while you went on vacation? Would you expect to come back and find anything still there?",1
WikiLeaks: Email Proves Democrats Manipulate Polls,"Email 

An email published by WikiLeaks on Friday reveals the extent to which Democrats and their allies manipulate polls to serve their ends. 
The 2008 email appears shows Democratic operatives plotting to intentionally oversample seniors in a poll in order to get their desired results. 
‚ÄúFYI: We are going to try to do an oversample of seniors on the poll. Sample too small otherwise,‚Äù operative Tom Matzzie wrote to Clinton adviser Paul Begala, campaign Chairman John Podesta, Media Matters for America founder David Brock, and operative Susan McCue. ‚ÄúGood,‚Äù Begala responded. 
Trump and his supporters have claimed often that many polls showing a significant Hillary lead over Trump have been manipulated through selective sampling. There is ample evidence that this occurs in Democrat-friendly newsrooms. 
‚ÄúHillary Clinton has opened up a 7-point lead over Donald Trump in an online poll that seems to reflect a ‚Äòbounce‚Äô for the former secretary of state after she wrapped up the Democratic nomination last week,‚Äù the Daily Mail reported in June. 
""But the weekly tracking poll, from NBC News and the Surveymonkey company, included the opinions of 7 percent more self-identified Democrats than Republicans ‚Äì the same margin as the poll's topline result,"" the article noted. 
The email released by WikiLeaks Friday proves that Democratic operatives themselves engage eagerly in such tactics. 
Polls are a powerful propaganda tool, and people exposed repeatedly to polls suggesting their candidate's loss is a foregone conclusion will often be influenced to stay home on Election Day. 
""I think sometimes polling is done to dampen election turnout,"" Rand Paul said in an interview on Wednesday on ""The Tom Roten Show"" out of West Virginia. ""When we say over and over someone can't win that is a form of rigging in the sense that it is designed to suppress turnout,"" he added.",1
North Korea Threatens ‚ÄòSacred‚Äô Nuclear War Against Israel if this country continue supporting ISIS,"Email 
North Korea‚Äôs Foreign Ministry slammed the ‚Äúshamelessness of Israel‚Äù on Friday, calling the Jewish State a ‚Äúrogue group‚Äù that ‚Äúposes a nuclear threat‚Äù and commits ‚Äúterrorist attack[s]‚Äù against neighboring countries.

After Netanyahu criticized Pyongyang during a trip to Japan last year, the North Korean Foreign Ministry released a similar statement, which called Israel a ""cancer to peace in the Middle East.‚Äù It also accused Netanyahu of trying to use North Korea ‚Äúto divert international criticism of Israel caused by its settlement activity and breakdown in the Middle East peace talks.""

"'If Trump loses, I'm grabbing my musket,' former congressman tweets","Email 

Former Illinois congressman and conservative radio host Joe Walsh appeared to invite armed insurrection when he tweeted that he was ""grabbing his musket"" if Hillary Clinton defeats Donald Trump in the presidential election. 
""On November 8th, I'm voting for Trump,"" Walsh tweeted. ""On November 9th, if Trump loses, I'm grabbing my musket."" 
""@WalshFreedom what exactly does that mean?"" CNN's Jake Tapper tweeted in reply. 
""@jaketapper It means protesting,"" Walsh tweeted. ""Participating in acts of civil disobedience. Doing what it takes to get our country back."" 
Walsh's rhetoric comes as Americans are already nervous about what will happen on and after Election Day. Trump's insistence that the election is ""rigged,"" and his statement at the last debate that he would keep America ""in suspense"" about whether or not he will accept the results, have left some in fear that violence could flare up if his supporters refuse to accept the outcome. 
More than half of Americans expressed concern about violence on election day according to a USA TODAY/Suffolk University poll released Wednesday. 
Walsh dismissed another Twitter user's concern that his call to arms could draw the attention of the Secret Service saying, ""They understand that a musket hasn't been used in battle in almost 200 years."" 
""I'm serious,"" Walsh tweeted later. ""I don't think a musket would do much good these days, but it's time for civil disobedience on the right."" 
Walsh repeated his defense that he was only speaking of civil disobedience to NBC's Chicago affiliate. ""We're talking about a musket,"" Walsh said, according to NBC 5 Chicago. ""I could've said grab your slingshot and let's go. Metaphorically, I meant grab your muskets, if Trump loses, man, we're going to do what we have to do. We're going to protest and boycott and practice civil disobedience. We may start a third party."" 
This wasn't the first time Walsh, who served one term before being defeated by Rep. Tammy Duckworth in 2012, drew criticism for an incendiary tweet. In July he got national attention for telling President Obama to ""watch out"" after five police officers were killed by a shooter in Dallas. 
""3 Dallas Cops killed, 7 wounded,"" Walsh tweeted in a post that has since been deleted. ""This is now war. Watch out Obama. Watch out black lives matter punks. Real America is coming after you.""",1

"Rigged Primary, Media, and Candidate; the American Rigged System","Email 

The excitement over the US election is culminating as the due date is getting closer. Each candidate is trying to use any device at hand to denigrate the other and morality is the last thing to strike the minds of the candidates. The fact of the matter is that morality is a dead circle in the American politics. Hillary Clinton, the democratic candidate, uses f-word in a debate ( http://en.institutomanquehue.org/publications/news/did-hillary-clinton-mutter-donald-trump-debate.html ) watched by hundreds of millions of people around the world and finds no shame in it. Even American religious leaders believe that Clinton is not competent to be the president of a religious country like United States ( http://en.institutomanquehue.org/publications/news/christian-right-leader-hillary-clinton-hostile-biblical-christianity.html ). On the other hand, the GOP candidate, Donald trump , has no better condition. His sexual harassments and violent ideas towards women were shocking not only for female victims, but also for the dominant male group in America. The violent use of words to address different groups of people, mainly in social media ( http://en.institutomanquehue.org/publications/news/as-first-lady-melania-trump-wants-to-save-you-from-her-husband.html ) , made it hard for the parents to allow their kids to follow him. Besides, the number of women that accused Trump of groping and rape ( http://en.institutomanquehue.org/publications/news/list-women-accused-donald-trump-of-sexual-assault.html ) is increasing day by day and the list is running on. The so-called locker-room video of Trump talking dirty about women and his attitude towards them leaked to the public to be the final shot on the republican candidate, but it did not have that much affect. It seems that even grabbing ‚Äúthe women by the p‚Ä¶y‚Äù could not change their idea about Trump. 
All these information, some released by the opponent candidate and some by other sources mainly WikiLeaks, seems to have had little significance in the public orientation in choosing a candidate. This has less to do with the people than with the administration system and media empire in the United States. 
The fact that Trump does not talk about a rigged-election for respecting democracy and exercising the law is clear as a truth. His words that ‚ÄúI will accept the result of the election if I were chosen‚Äù is more like a joke than the words of a would-be president. What Assange is trying to say in his tweet is that the rig is being done on a higher level than the polls or the voting system. The whole administration and political system is rigged in America and the people will not choose a candidate; they are chosen to choose. This is the truth behind the weird public orientation towards election in spite of all the information released about the corruptions of the two candidates in mass media. The fact that the media and the political system are rigging the election in a latent mode is the key to the question raised about the mysteries of the American election.",1

Hillary Clinton‚Äôs ‚ÄúSudden Move‚Äù Of $1.8 Billion To Qatar Central Bank Stuns Financial World,"Email 

An intriguing Ministry of Finance (MoF) report circulating in the Kremlin today says that elite Western bankers were stunned a few hours ago after the Bank For International Settlements (BIS) registered a $1.8 billion transfer from the Clinton Foundation (CF) to the Qatar Central Bank (QCB) through the ‚Äúfacilitation/abetment‚Äù of JP Morgan Chase & Company (JPM)‚Äîand for reasons yet to be firmly established. 
According to this report, the Bank for International Settlements is the world's oldest international financial organization and acts as a prime counterparty for central banks in their financial transactions; the Qatar Central Bank is the bank of that Gulf State nations government and their ‚Äúbank of banks‚Äù; JP Morgan Chase & Company is the United States largest ‚Äúmegabank‚Äù; and the Clinton Foundation is an international criminal money laundering organization whose clients include the Russian mafia. 
With Hillary Clinton‚Äôs US presidential campaign Chairman John Podesta having longstanding ties to the Russian mafia and money laundering, this report continues, the Foreign Intelligence Service (SVR) maintains complete surveillance of him and his criminal associates‚Äîincluding both Hillary Clinton and her husband, and former US President, Bill Clinton. 
On Saturday 15 October (2016), this report notes, the SVR reported to the MoF that Hillary Clinton and John Podesta met with JP Morgan Chase & Company CEO Jamie Dimon at Clinton‚Äôs Chappaqua Compound outside of New York City‚Äîand who, in 2009, both President Obama and Hillary Clinton allowed to break US laws by his, Dimon‚Äôs, being able to buy millions-of-dollars of his company‚Äôs stocks prior to the public being told his JP Morgan bank was receiving a Federal Reserve $80 billion credit line‚Äîand that caused JP Morgan‚Äôs stocks to soar and that have had an astonishing 920% dividend growth since 2010. 
Within 12 hours of the Hillary Clinton-John Podesta-Jamie Dimon meeting at the Chappaqua Compound, this report continues, the BIS registered the transfer of $1.8 billion from the Clinton Foundation to the Qatar Central Bank. 
To why the Clinton Foundation transferred this enormous sum of money to Qatar, this report explains, is due to the longstanding ties between this Islamic neo-patrimonial absolute monarchy and then US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton who oversaw the ‚Äúmassive bribery scheme‚Äù that allowed this Gulf State nation to secure the 2022 World Cup‚Äîand that the Qataris were so appreciative of they donated millions to the Clinton Foundation, and incredibly, in 2011, gave former US President Bill Clinton $1 million for a birthday present‚Äîbringing Hillary Clinton‚Äôs total ‚Äúcash grab‚Äù from these Persian Gulf sheiks of $100 million‚Äîall occurring as recently released secret emails revealed Hillary Clinton‚Äôs knowledge that both Qatar and Saudi Arabia were, and still are, funding ISIS.

Hillary Clinton‚Äôs ‚ÄúSudden Move‚Äù Of $1.8 Billion To Qatar Central Bank Stuns Financial World,"Email 

An intriguing Ministry of Finance (MoF) report circulating in the Kremlin today says that elite Western bankers were stunned a few hours ago after the Bank For International Settlements (BIS) registered a $1.8 billion transfer from the Clinton Foundation (CF) to the Qatar Central Bank (QCB) through the ‚Äúfacilitation/abetment‚Äù of JP Morgan Chase & Company (JPM)‚Äîand for reasons yet to be firmly established. 
According to this report, the Bank for International Settlements is the world's oldest international financial organization and acts as a prime counterparty for central banks in their financial transactions; the Qatar Central Bank is the bank of that Gulf State nations government and their ‚Äúbank of banks‚Äù; JP Morgan Chase & Company is the United States largest ‚Äúmegabank‚Äù; and the Clinton Foundation is an international criminal money laundering organization whose clients include the Russian mafia. 
With Hillary Clinton‚Äôs US presidential campaign Chairman John Podesta having longstanding ties to the Russian mafia and money laundering, this report continues, the Foreign Intelligence Service (SVR) maintains complete surveillance of him and his criminal associates‚Äîincluding both Hillary Clinton and her husband, and former US President, Bill Clinton. 
On Saturday 15 October (2016), this report notes, the SVR reported to the MoF that Hillary Clinton and John Podesta met with JP Morgan Chase & Company CEO Jamie Dimon at Clinton‚Äôs Chappaqua Compound outside of New York City‚Äîand who, in 2009, both President Obama and Hillary Clinton allowed to break US laws by his, Dimon‚Äôs, being able to buy millions-of-dollars of his company‚Äôs stocks prior to the public being told his JP Morgan bank was receiving a Federal Reserve $80 billion credit line‚Äîand that caused JP Morgan‚Äôs stocks to soar and that have had an astonishing 920% dividend growth since 2010. 
Within 12 hours of the Hillary Clinton-John Podesta-Jamie Dimon meeting at the Chappaqua Compound, this report continues, the BIS registered the transfer of $1.8 billion from the Clinton Foundation to the Qatar Central Bank. 
To why the Clinton Foundation transferred this enormous sum of money to Qatar, this report explains, is due to the longstanding ties between this Islamic neo-patrimonial absolute monarchy and then US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton who oversaw the ‚Äúmassive bribery scheme‚Äù that allowed this Gulf State nation to secure the 2022 World Cup‚Äîand that the Qataris were so appreciative of they donated millions to the Clinton Foundation, and incredibly, in 2011, gave former US President Bill Clinton $1 million for a birthday present‚Äîbringing Hillary Clinton‚Äôs total ‚Äúcash grab‚Äù from these Persian Gulf sheiks of $100 million‚Äîall occurring as recently released secret emails revealed Hillary Clinton‚Äôs knowledge that both Qatar and Saudi Arabia were, and still are, funding ISIS.

Queen Elizabeth II owns every dolphin in Britain and doesn't need a driving licence and doesn't pay tax ‚Äî here are the incredible powers you didn't know the monarchy has,"Email 
Queen Elizabeth II is not like you and me. 
Did you know she is immune from prosecution? That she has her own personal poet, paid in Sherry wine? Or that she holds dominion over British swans and can fire the entire Australian government? 
It's true that her role as the British head of state is largely ceremonial, and the Monarch no longer holds any serious power from day to day. The historic ""prerogative powers"" of the Sovereign have been devolved largely to government ministers. But this still means that when the British government declares war, or regulates the civil service, or signs a treaty, it is doing so only on her authority. 
And she still wields some of these prerogative powers herself ‚Äî as well as numerous other unique powers, ranging from the surprising to the utterly bizarre. 
Most famously, she owns all swans in the River Thames. 
Technically, all unmarked swans in open water belong to the Queen, though the Crown ""exercises her ownership"" only ""on certain stretches of the Thames and its surrounding tributaries,"" according to the official website of the Royal Family. 
Today this tradition is observed during the annual ""Swan Upping,"" in which swans in the River Thames are caught, ringed, and set free again as part of census of the swan population. 
It's a highly ceremonial affair, taking place over five days. ""Swan uppers"" wear traditional uniforms and row upriver in six skiffs accompanied by the Queen's Swan Marker. 
""The swans are also given a health check and ringed with individual identification numbers by The Queen's Swan Warden, a Professor of Ornithology at the University of Oxford's Department of Zoology,"" according to the Royal Family website. 
""Rule, Britannia, Britannia rules the waves,"" goes a classic British song ‚Äî and this rule extends beneath the waves, too. The sovereign has dominion over a variety of aquatic animals in British waters. 
The Queen still technically owns all the sturgeons, whales, and dolphins in the waters around England and Wales, in a rule that dates back to a statute from 1324, during the reign of King Edward II, according to Time. 
According to the article: ""This statute is still valid today, and sturgeons, porpoises, whales, and dolphins are recognised as 'fishes royal': when they are captured within 3 miles (about 5 km) of UK shores or wash ashore, they may be claimed on behalf of the Crown. Generally, when brought into port, a sturgeon is sold in the usual way, and the purchaser, as a gesture of loyalty, requests the honour of its being accepted by Elizabeth."" 
The law is still observed: In 2004, a Welsh fisherman was investigated by the police after catching a 10-foot sturgeon, the BBC reported at the time. The Scottish government also issued guidance on the law in 2007, writing that ""the right to claim Royal Fish in Scotland allows the Scottish Government (on behalf of the Crown) to claim stranded whales which are too large to be drawn to land by a 'wain pulled by six oxen.'"" 
The Queen can drive without a licence. 
Driving licenses are issued in the Queen's name, yet she is the only person in the United Kingdom who doesn't legally need a license to drive or a number plate on her cars, according to Time. 
Despite not being required to have a license, the Queen is comfortable behind the wheel, having learned to drive during World War II when she operated a first-aid truck for the Women's Auxillary Territorial Service. (As a result of the Queen's training, she can also change a spark plug, Time notes). 
Queen Elizabeth II isn't afraid to show off her driving skills, either. In 1998, she surprised King Abdullah of Saudi Arabia (then still a prince) by driving him around in her country seat of Balmoral. 
Former British Ambassador Sherard Cowper-Coles recounted the meeting in the Sunday Times: ""As instructed, the crown prince climbed into the front seat of the front Land Rover, with his interpreter in the seat behind. To his surprise, the Queen climbed into the driving seat, turned the ignition and drove off. Women are not ‚Äî yet ‚Äî allowed to drive in Saudi Arabia, and Abdullah was not used to being driven by a woman, let alone a queen."" 
Cowper-Coles continued: ""His nervousness only increased as the Queen, an army driver in wartime, accelerated the Land Rover along the narrow Scottish estate roads, talking all the time. Through his interpreter, the crown prince implored the Queen to slow down and concentrate on the road ahead."" 
Unlike other members of the Royal family, the Queen does not require a passport, as they are issued in her name. Despite this lack of travel documents, she has been abroad many times. 
She has two birthdays. 
When you're the British head of state, one birthday just isn't enough. The Queen's official birthday is celebrated on a Saturday in June, though her actual birthday is on April 21. 
""Official celebrations to mark a sovereign's birthday have often been held on a day other than the actual birthday, particularly when the actual birthday has not been in the summer,"" according to the Royal Mint. 
Both birthdays are celebrated in suitable style, too. Her actual birthday ""is marked publicly by gun salutes in central London at midday,"" according to the official website of the British Monarchy. This includes ""a 41-gun salute in Hyde Park, a 21-gun salute in Windsor Great Park, and a 62-gun salute at the Tower of London. In 2006, Her Majesty celebrated her 80th Birthday in 2006 with a walkabout in the streets outside of Windsor Castle to meet well-wishers."" 
For her ""official"" birthday celebrations, meanwhile, she ""is joined by other members of the Royal Family at the spectacular Trooping the Colour parade, which moves between Buckingham Palace, The Mall, and Horseguards' Parade."" 
She has her own private cash machine. 
Less a ""power"" and more a perk of the job, a private cash machine for use by the royal family is installed in the basement of Buckingham Palace. It's provided by Coutts, one of Britain's most prestigious ‚Äî and exclusive ‚Äî banks. 
The Queen has her own personal poet. 
The poet laureate is an honorary position in British society appointed by the Monarch to a poet ""whose work is of national significance,"" according to the official website of the British Monarchy. When first the role was introduced, the appointee was paid ¬£200 per year plus a butt of canary wine. Today the poet laureate is given a barrel of Sherry. 
Carol Ann Duffy will hold the position until 2019. 
She has to sign laws. 
The Queen's consent is necessary to turn any bill into an actual law. Once a proposed law has passed both houses of Parliament, it makes its way to the Palace for approval, which is called ""Royal Assent."" The most recent British Monarch to refuse to provide Royal Assent was Queen Anne, back in 1708. 
Royal Assent is different than ""Queen's consent,"" in which the Queen must consent to any law being debated in Parliament that affects the Monarchy's interests (such as reforming the prerogative or tax laws that might affect the Duchy of Cornwall, for example). Without consent, the bill cannot be debated in Parliament. 
Queen's consent is exercised only on the advice of ministers, but its existence provides the government with a tool for blocking debate on certain subjects if bills are tabled by backbench rebels or the opposition. 
It has been exercised at least 39 times, according to documents released under the Freedom of Information act, including ""one instance [in which] the Queen completely vetoed the Military Actions Against Iraq Bill in 1999, a private member's bill that sought to transfer the power to authorise military strikes against Iraq from the monarch to parliament,"" The Guardian reported in 2013. 
She can create Lords. 
The Queen has the power to appoint Lords, who can then sit in Parliament, the upper house in Britain's legislative system. Like many other powers, this is exercised only ""on the advice of"" elected government ministers. 
She doesn't have to pay tax (but she does anyway). 
The Queen does not have to pay tax, but she has been voluntarily paying income tax and capital gains tax since 1992. 
The Queen has the power to form governments. 
Unlike the Queen, Prime Minister David Cameron doesn't literally sit on a throne. Rob Stothard/Getty Images/HBO/BI 
The Queen previously wielded the power to dissolve Parliament and call a general election, but the Fixed-Term Parliaments Act put an end to that in 2011. Now a two-thirds vote in the commons is required to dissolve Parliament before a five-year fixed-term is up. 
She does still play a part after an election, however, when she calls on the MP most able to form a government to do so. 
This caused some worry ahead of this year's General Election. It once looked as if the Conservatives might not have a majority (but would be the largest party) and would try to form a government. Meanwhile, it was feasible that Labour could form a majority, despite having fewer seats, by entering into a coalition with multiple other parties. 
In this situation, the Queen would have been stuck between a rock and a hard place. Every year, she opens Parliament with the Queen's speech, which lays out the government's plans. But to give David Cameron's speech would arguably be to tacitly endorse his government ‚Äî while staying away would send the opposite message. 
At one point, The Times was told by sources that she planned to ""stay away"" if Cameron failed to secure enough MPs, but the Palace later had an about-face. ""Royal sources confirmed she would lead proceedings, even if there was a risk the speech would be overthrown the following week because the Tories had failed to muster enough backing from smaller parties,"" The Times subsequently reported. 
She has knights.‚Äã 
Sure, they no longer ride around on horseback wooing maidens with their tales of valour, but Britain still retains knights. Like Lords, they are appointed by the Queen ‚Äî and she knights them personally. 
Knighthoods are typically given to figures who have made a particular contribution to British society ‚Äî whether in business, the arts, the military, or elsewhere. After Terry Pratchett was knighted, the legendary fantasy author forged himself a special sword using pieces of a meteorite. 
The individuals knighted are decided by ministers, the BBC reports, ""who present her with a list of nominees each year for her approval."" 
She is exempt from Freedom Of Information requests. 
All information about the royal family is exempt from Freedom of Information requests. The exemption was made after a legal battle between The Guardian and the government to have letters from Prince Charles sent to Whitehall ministers made public. The so-called black spider memos were recently released, but the change means the same can't happen in the future. 
She can ignore or overrule ministerial advice in ""grave constitutional crisis."" 
While the overwhelming majority of the Queen's prerogative powers are devolved to her ministers, there is one exception that allows her to wield power herself. Only ""in grave constitutional crisis,"" the Sovereign can ""act contrary to or without Ministerial advice."" With no precedent in modern times, it's not clear what would actually constitute this, but the possibility remains. 
The Queen holds the ability to fire the entire Australian government. 
As the head of state in Australia, the Queen has certain powers over the government. In 1975, for example, the Queen's representative in the country at the time, Gov. Gen. Sir John Kerr, fired the prime minister in response to a government shutdown. 
""[Kerr] appointed a replacement, who immediately passed the spending bill to fund the government, Max Fisher wrote in The Washington Post. ""Three hours later, Kerr dismissed the rest of Parliament. Then Australia held elections to restart from scratch. And they haven't had another shutdown since."" 
In addition to the UK and Australia, the Queen is also the head of state in Antigua and Barbuda, the Bahamas, Barbados, Belize, Canada, Grenada, Jamaica, New Zealand, Papua New Guinea, Saint Kitts and Nevis, Saint Lucia, Saint Vincent and the Grenadines, Solomon Islands, and Tuvalu. 
All the above are Commonwealth Realms, or former British colonies. The British sovereign retains the position she holds in the United Kingdom, that of head of state. As in Britain, this is largely a ceremonial role from day to day. 
She's the head of a religion. 
Queen Elizabeth II is the head of the Church of England, Britain's state religion first established after King Henry VIII split away from the Catholic Church in Rome in the 16th century. 
Her formal title is defender of the faith and supreme governor of the Church of England, and she also has the power to appoint Bishops and Archbishops. As with many of her other powers, however, this is exercised only on the advice of the prime minister, who himself takes advice from a Church Commission. 
An interesting side effect of this is that the Sovereign must be a confirmed member of Church of England. Catholics and those of other religions may not ascend to the British throne. If Prince Charles converted to Islam, for example, he would be unable to become king after Queen Elizabeth II dies. 
She gets to give away special money to the elderly. 
Maundy money is a special kind of silver coin the Queen gives away to pensioners every year at a UK cathedral every Easter in a special ceremony. The number of recipients corresponds with the Sovereign's age. This year, for example, she will be 89 when Easter rolls around, so she will give maundy money away to 89 pensioners. 
The coins are technically legal tender, despite coming in unconventional 3-pence and 4-pence denominations. But given the coins' rare status, they tend not to enter general circulation. 
She's also immune from prosecution. 
All prosecutions are carried out in the name of the Sovereign, and she is both immune from prosecution and cannot be compelled to give evidence in court. 
In theory, the Sovereign ""is incapable of thinking or doing wrong,"" legal scholar John Kirkhope told Business Insider. However, barrister Baroness Helena Kennedy QC told the BBC in 2002 that ""nowadays, that immunity is questionable."" 
""Although civil and criminal proceedings cannot be taken against the Sovereign as a person under UK law, the Queen is careful to ensure that all her activities in her personal capacity are carried out in strict accordance with the law,"" according to official site of the Monarchy. 
If the monarch did commit a grievance offence, he or she would almost certainly be forced to abdicate. There is at least one precedent of the Courts' prosecuting the Sovereign. In the 17th Century, King Charles I was tried for treason following the English Civil War. He said ""no earthly power can justly call me (who am your King) in question as a delinquent."" The Court disagreed and had him executed. 
The Queen has the right to be consulted, to encourage, and to warn her ministers. 
Assuming no ""grave constitutional crisis,"" the Queen's input into the legislative process is supposed to be limited in real terms to the right ""to be consulted, to encourage, and to warn"" her ministers ‚Äî advice delivered via meetings with the prime minister. 
The Queen also has certain historic rights and privileges. John Kirkhope, a lawyer who successfully campaigned to have details of ""Queen's consent"" made public, provided Business Insider with a list of some of the stranger rights the Queen still holds. 
Hungerford has to present a red rose to the Sovereign in exchange for its fishing and grazing rights.The Duke of Atholl must pay by way of a rose whenever the Sovereign calls. This most recently happened during the reign of Queen Victoria, so it's unclear whether the rose has to be any particular colour.If the Sovereign passes near Kidwelly Castle in Wales, the tenant has to provide a bodyguard in full armour. This is complicated slightly by the fact the castle is a ruin.The Marquis of Ailesbury owns Savernake Forest and is required to produce a blast on a hunting horn should the Sovereign pass through the Forest. This last happened in 1943.Similarly, the owner of Dunlambert Castle in Northern Ireland has to produce a blast on an ancient bugle.And lastly, many landowners must also pay a ""quit-rent"" ‚Äî a kind of tax on their property paid to the Monarch. Some are pretty unusual. 
The owner of Sauchlemuir Castle must set out three glasses of port on New Year's Eve for the grandmother of James IV of Scotland. (For reference, James IV served from 1474 to 1513.)The owner of Fowlis must deliver ‚Äî when required ‚Äî a snowball in mid-summer.The City of Gloucester pays for its holdings of Crown Lands by providing an enormous eel pie.Great Yarmouth must provide a hundred herrings baked in 24 pasties to the Sheriff, who then sends them to the Lord of the Manor ‚Äî who then sends them to the Sovereign.The Duke of Marlborough has to present a small satin flag with a Fleur de Lys on August 13, the anniversary of the Battle of Blenheim.The Duke of Wellington has to present a French Tricolour flag before noon on June 19 ‚Äî the anniversary of the Battle of Waterloo.",1

"Coming soon, to a French neighborhood near you‚Ä¶7,000 MORE illegal alien Muslim invaders who set fire to their Calais jungle camp as the camp was being shut down","BNI Store Oct 26 2016 Coming soon, to a French neighborhood near you‚Ä¶7,000 MORE illegal alien Muslim invaders who set fire to their Calais jungle camp as the camp was being shut down Hey, where are all the women and children? Reuters French authorities said on Wednesday they had finished clearing the ‚ÄúJungle‚Äù, a squalid shantytown outside Calais built by Muslim invaders who had hoped to make the passage to Britain but whose last inhabitants are now mostly dispersed around France. The operation passed off peacefully for the most part, though some migrants torched tents and shelters in a last act of defiance as their hopes of a new life in Britain evaporated. Some reports say that British anarchists set fire to the tents. ‚ÄúThis is the end of the ‚ÄòJungle‚Äô,‚Äù Calais regional prefect Fabienne Buccio said. ‚ÄúMission accomplished.‚Äù Earlier in the day, riot police spread out around the camp, and fire trucks moved in to put out blazes that sent plumes of smoke into the sky. Muslim freeloaders from the Middle East, Asia and Africa congregated to Calais hoping to cross the short stretch of sea to Britain by leaping on trucks and trains, or even walking through the tunnel under the Channel. Britain refused to accept the vast majority of them ‚Äì apart from a number of unaccompanied child migrants (who are actually adults in their 20‚Äôs and 30‚Äôs) now being processed separately ‚Äì and high fences were built to keep them away from the port traffic, but still they came. Local opposition to the sprawling slum, along with growing criticism from right-wing politicians, finally stung the French government into action. The British referendum vote this year to quit the European Union was in large part driven by such worries, and stoked by scenes of the Calais migrants trying to force their way in. Hamid, 30, from Afghanistan, said he had been among those setting fire to shelters in the Jungle, and still hoped to cross the Channel to Britain. ‚ÄúWe don‚Äôt care about problems that are to come after this. We did it because we don‚Äôt want to stay in France,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúWe want to go to England and England only. It doesn‚Äôt matter if I go to jail here.‚Äù",1

"When a Muslim in America runs for political office, the ONLY reason he is running is to spread Islam. Period.","BNI Store Oct 26 2016 When a Muslim in America runs for political office, the ONLY reason he is running is to spread Islam. Period. FLORIDA: Mass mailing sent to Temple Terrace homes in the Tampa area questions whether or not a Muslim candidate is fit for office and offers solid reasons why he probably is not. CAIR-Florida City Council candidate Wael Odeh has lived more than three decades in this town of 25,000 straddling the Hillsborough River. Odeh is also a Muslim, born in Palestinian territory, and some believes that‚Äôs enough to disqualify him from election to the City Council. An anonymous letter has been mailed to a number of addresses in Temple Terrace questioning whether City Hall is safe with a Muslim working there and whether Odeh has ties to terrorism. The typewritten, single-spaced, one-page letter is dated October 2016. Among a number of questions it poses: ‚ÄúCould Odeh‚Äôs election be a foot in the door of Sharia Law‚Äôs subtle influence in our community?‚Äù Sharia is the detailed system of religious law developed by Muslim scholars in the early centuries of Islam and still in force among fundamentalists. Among other questions raised in the letter are why Odeh has not revealed in campaign mailers where he was born. The letter also questions whether he forces his wife into a subservient role, as do some observers of sharia. In addition, the letter says that designated terrorist group CAIR (Council on American-Islamic Relations) endorses Odeh and claims the group has links to terrorism (It does) . In a statement to the Times, CAIR Florida‚Äôs government affairs director Laila Abdelaziz said, ‚ÄúThis unfounded and slanderous attack on Mr. Odeh is concerning, and we hope Temple Terrace residents, community leaders and neighbors will reject its Islamophobic message.‚Äù Still, Temple Terrace City Council member Grant Rimbey said he worries the truth may not matter to a certain block of voters. ‚ÄúThat is the sad reality,‚Äù Rimbey said. ‚ÄúI think there is racism in the city‚Äù and there are people ‚Äúwho want to keep Temple Terrace looking like it did in 1952 forever.‚Äù (What ‚Äúrace‚Äù is Islam?) Rimbey and Odeh estimate that 20 to 25 percent of Temple Terrace‚Äôs population is Muslim. (Now, that really IS disturbing ‚Äì more Muslim block-busting) Six candidates have applied for two open seats on the council; the two candidates recording the most votes Nov. 8 will fill the positions. Odeh said he invites anyone with questions about Muslims to reach out to him ‚Äî including the author of the anonymous letter. ‚ÄúIf he wanted to learn more, he should have come to me directly.‚Äù (He learned everything he needed to know about Muslims on 9/11)",1

The girls ‚Äì sisters aged 9, 11 and 14 ‚Äì were surrounded and molested by seven Muslims, the youngest of whom was just seven. UK Express (h/t Terry D) The father of the schoolgirls said he had dropped them off at the swimming pool as a treat for the older girl‚Äôs 14th birthday.

UK Child Protection Services workers are ‚Äòafraid‚Äô to challenge the ages of Muslim invaders for fear of ending up in court,"BNI Store Oct 27 2016 UK Child Protection Services workers are ‚Äòafraid‚Äô to challenge the ages of Muslim invaders for fear of ending up in court Industry insiders reveal they often meet obviously adult-aged Muslim invaders posing as children who are permitted to stay in the country because challenging them can put their career at risk. The revelations came after the arrivals of Muslim ‚Äúchild‚Äù economic freeloaders from Calais ‚Äì who apparently are much older than the teenage years they had claimed. UK Express (h/t Terry D) Britain was once again divided over the issue with Conservative MP David Davies suggesting they should be made to undergo dental tests to establish their age. His comments were met with fury by the British Dental Association (BDA) which said tests were ‚Äúinvasive‚Äù ‚Äì a statement which was backed by the Home Office. But, speaking to Express Online a social worker who asked not to be named has revealed the REAL struggles faced by those in the industry. According to the specialist THREE professionals are assigned to the first meeting with a migrant who claims to be a child. And senior child protection officers are at their wits‚Äô end. He said: ‚ÄúSo a social worker is assigned the case. The social worker attends the assessment and because the asylum seeker is claiming to be under 17 (to come under the children‚Äôs Act) an appropriate adult is also in attendance and so is an interpreter. ‚ÄúUsually they enter the room and they see this asylum seeker is well over 17. It is that obvious. ‚ÄúAfter they have done the process three times all three social workers have to come to a consensus on the estimated age of the asylum seeker ‚Äì so let‚Äôs says all three say this asylum seeker is well over 17 or 18 years old. You would think that would be the end of the process, but not so. ‚ÄúThey tell their managers of their decisions and then the manager tells them ‚ÄòIf that‚Äôs your decision then okay but the asylum seeker will now be assigned a solicitor to challenge your opinion and you are likely to be cross examined in court‚Äô. After this phase of the investigation is complete, if a social worker chooses to challenge the age, they are reportedly met with anger and abuse. Many, he claims, have received calls calling them ‚Äúracist‚Äù and have had complaints made against them. Those put in this position have said they ‚Äúcannot afford‚Äù to fight it. One said: ‚ÄúI just sign and say he‚Äôs under 17 years because it‚Äôs not worth the hassle.‚Äù Social workers and child protection experts have called the system ‚Äúbroken‚Äù in Britain. Aid workers in Calais recently admitted to the press child migrants ARE lying about their age to get to the front of the queue to Britain ‚Äì and are shredding their real documents.

He claimed she had been ‚Äúforced‚Äù by teachers to memorize the Islamic chants and forwarded the handout to Austrian news service unsertirol24. UK Express (h/t Terry D) The handout read: ‚ÄúOh Allah, how perfect you are and praise be to you. Blessed is your name, and exalted is your majesty. There is no God but you.‚Äù It had been given to the girl during a lesson in ‚Äúethics‚Äù at the Bavarian school. Headteacher Gisela Herl did not confirm the incident when questioned, but said the school would issue a written statement detailing its position in the coming week. The incident comes just weeks after parents complained to German newspaper Hessian Nieders√§chsische Allgemeine (HNA) that their children‚Äôs nursery was refusing to acknowledge ‚ÄúChristmas rituals‚Äù to accommodate the ‚Äúdiverse cultures‚Äù of other pupils. The Sara Nussbaum House daycare centre in Kassel refused to put up a Christmas tree, tell Christmas stories or celebrate Christmas in general because it said only a minority of pupils. A spokesman for Kassel explained: ‚ÄúThere will be no Christmas celebrations, in the strictest sense. Because the majority of children at this kindergarten are not Christian the festival will not be celebrated in the way that it is at other schools.‚Äù Migrants now outnumber native children at many schools in Germany as the country has been inundated with Muslim migrants in recent years. More than one million migrants are estimated to have arrived in Germany during the last year alone.

The irony is that the LGBTQWERTY community is almost uniformly liberal. They support the people who are stoning them, throwing them from buildings, and hanging them. They have ceded any influence with the political Right, as no matter what the Right does, they will not get any meaningful Gay support. That means that just or unjust, there is absolutely no upside to supporting Gay issues. There is a small upside from the Christian Right, to pissing on them.

HILLARY‚ÄôS (Islamic) AMERICA IS ALREADY HERE where ‚ÄòMuslim NO-GO ZONES‚Äô are popping up all over Michiganistan,"HILLARY‚ÄôS (Islamic) AMERICA IS ALREADY HERE where ‚ÄòMuslim NO-GO ZONES‚Äô are popping up all over Michiganistan The rest of America may be agonizing over the security implications of taking in potential Islamic jihadists posing as refugees. But Syrian Muslim invaders are being welcomed with open arms in Hamtramck, Michigan ‚Äì America‚Äôs first and only majority Muslim city. Non-Muslim residents in the Dearborn area are saying ‚ÄòYou know, we‚Äôre getting ready to sell and get out of here.‚Äô‚Äù (Before property values tank as a result of the Muslim invasion with a mosque on every corner, blasting amplified Islamic Calls to Prayer several times a day) WND ( h/t Liz) Once 90 percent Polish Catholic, the blue-collar enclave just outside Detroit has been transformed by successive waves of immigrants from Bangladesh, Yemen and Bosnia. Muslims now outnumber non-Muslims, the council has a Muslim majority and the call to prayer echoes through the streets five times a day. ‚ÄúThey‚Äôre setting this all up so they can continue their ancient squabbles that they have carried on for centuries in the Middle East right here your neighborhood,‚Äù Corcoran said. They call it ‚Äúculture shift.‚Äù Places, in America, that no longer look or feel like America. (In Europe, they are referred to as NO-GO Zones) Cedar Riverside in Minneapolis fits the bill, with its large Somali community known as ‚ÄúLittle Mogadishu,‚Äù as does and Hamtramck, Michigan, where the Islamic call to prayer is shouted over loudspeakers and the local city council is now majority-Muslim . Parts of Amarillo, Texas, have been flooded with so many Muslim refugees that some ethnic enclaves claim to have elected their own tribal leaders independent of the city government, the city‚Äôs mayor recently testified before the Texas Legislature . Then there is Dearborn, Michigan, which is now 40 percent Muslim and spilling over into neighboring cities and towns. Documentary filmmaker Dennis Michael Lynch recently drove through Dearborn, guided by a lifelong resident of the city named Brian (see video below). What Brian showed him was not just a culture shift but something closer to a shock. Women walk the streets dressed in long, black burqas that cover all but their eyes. Almost all the signs on storefronts are in Arabic or some other Middle Eastern dialect. Arab businessmen buy up commercial properties, force out the American tenants and replace them with similar businesses run by Muslims, Brian told Lynch in the documentary. The same phenomenon is now beginning to occur in nearby Sterling Heights, Troy, Oak Park and Clinton Township. In Sterling Heights, residents informed WND this week that Middle Eastern refugees are being housed in a local hotel owned by an Arab-American businessman. But in Dearborn, the tremendous growth in the Muslim community started more than 20 years ago, fueled by local universities and industry. Muslims voting for Muslims only ‚ÄúBrian still lives there. He‚Äôs not going anywhere,‚Äù Lynch told WND in an interview. ‚ÄúIt depends on where you go in the city, but certain segments are 100 percent Muslim. Brian said to be prepared. We went through the areas, went shopping at the food mart. You really don‚Äôt feel like you are in America anymore.‚Äù Lynch said he was a regular contributor on Fox News between 2012 and 2015, until he started making hard-hitting documentaries on the U.S. immigration system. In certain areas in Dearborn. ‚ÄúYou have two areas, and it‚Äôs almost like the Ford plants separate the two sides, and when you cross to the other side it‚Äôs totally radical again. We went to a park where kids were playing after school with the mothers all there, and everybody was dressed in full burqa. It was almost like it was Halloween. I‚Äôd never seen anything like it in my life.‚Äù Dearborn does not exist on an island. Residents of southeastern Michigan have every reason to expect their towns will one day look like Dearborn, Lynch said, thanks to President Obama‚Äôs Syrian refugee resettlement program, which Hillary Clinton says she‚Äôd like to expand by more than 500 percent. This is ‚ÄúHillary‚Äôs America,‚Äù says a resident of nearby Rochester Hills who is one of the co-founders of SecureMichigan.org , a group that started up last year with the mission of helping educate Michiganders about Shariah law and Islamic settlements. He said the Islamization is literally moving from town to town in Oakland, Macomb and Wayne counties. ‚ÄúThe Sterling Heights story is significant because we have these budding ‚ÄòShariahvilles‚Äô in Michigan,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúWe know there are refugees being planted. Now, in Rochester Hills, I‚Äôve got five covered women walking down my street, and that‚Äôs never happened until two weeks ago.‚Äù In one 18-day period from Oct. 1 through Oct. 18, the U.S. State Department and its federal contractors have sent 199 Syrians to three counties in southeast Michigan ‚Äì Oakland, Macomb and Wayne ‚Äìand Oakland County leaders have not received any advance notice of the arrivals, said sources familiar with the growing controversy. The government contractors secretly planting the refugees in southeast Michigan are Lutheran Services/Samaritas, Catholic Charities of Southeast Michigan, USRI and Episcopal Migration Services. In Dearborn, the tremendous growth in the Muslim community started more than 20 years ago, fueled by local universities and industry. ‚ÄúBrian still lives there. He‚Äôs not going anywhere,‚Äù Lynch told WND in an interview. ‚ÄúIt depends on where you go in the city, but certain segments are 100 percent Muslim. Brian said to be prepared. We went through the areas, went shopping at the food mart. You really Dearborn is but a harbinger of things to come for many more cities and towns across America if Hillary Clinton is elected president of the United States. ‚ÄúI think if she gets elected you‚Äôre going to see more immigration from Mideast countries than under any of the previous presidents including Obama, because she obviously has ties to those countries, getting an incredible amount of money donated from them,‚Äù Lynch said. ‚ÄúThese donations come with strings. They come with side deals, and we don‚Äôt know what they are. It may be something as simple as ‚ÄòOK, we want to see more immigration from our country or some other country into the United States.‚Äô Why else is there any need to increase the Syrian refugee settlements in America? There‚Äôs no reason. ‚ÄúIf you look at all at the pay-for-play things, Muslims have said they want to spread Islam across the globe. The one country that doesn‚Äôt have that much of it is the United States.‚Äù Member of first Muslim-majority City Council warns: ‚ÄúToday we show the Polish‚Äù‚Ä¶thatMuslims are in charge. Within moments of winning the city‚Äôs election, an organizer involved in the government takeover was caught making ominous threats against non-Muslims in the city. HillaryDaily T his warning is no doubt troubling in its own right, but becomes even more unsettling when one pairs the comment with recent polling that suggests what Muslims would do should they take over any facet of government. Over half reject the first amendment, while 46% want blasphemers punished. 12% percent would even like to see those who commit blasphemy killed outright. Given their comments about the white population in the area, coupled with the sobering statistics outlined in the recent poll, it looks as if the city of Hamtramck, Michigan may be faced with a extremist city council under which they must be governed.",1

"BELGIUM: Iranian Muslim invader found guilty of drugging, repeatedly raping, and threatening to kill a 15-year-old Belgian schoolgirl, GETS NO JAIL TIME!","BNI Store Oct 28 2016 BELGIUM: Iranian Muslim invader found guilty of drugging, repeatedly raping, and threatening to kill a 15-year-old Belgian schoolgirl, GETS NO JAIL TIME! An Iranian Muslim illegal alien migrant who threatened to kill a runaway schoolgirl if she screamed as he repeatedly raped her has been spared any jail in a shock sentencing. The 20-year-old Muslim whose identity is being protected ( why? ), was found guilty of drugging, raping, and threatening the young girl by the court in Tongeren, Belgium. But the typical Muslim pervert has been spared jail in a shock verdict ‚Äì and got away with a suspended sentence. UK Express The harrowing incident happened in April 2014, after the young girl and a female friend ran away from their hometown of Bertem. When the friend decided to return home two days later, the 15-year-old carried on her journey ‚Äì taking a bus from Hasselt to Genk on her own. There, after arriving at 11pm on April 20, she took up with a gang of other young people who were hanging around in the city centre, and was taken to one of their apartments where she was plied with alcohol and drugs. The young girl later fell asleep at the flat, but was woken up just hours later by the 20-year-old Iranian Muslim who repeatedly raped her. During the horrific sex attack, she was bitten by her abuser and nearly suffocated after he put his hands around her throat to stop her screaming. He threatened to kill her if she continued to call for help. The court heard that after the attack, she did not dare to ask for help any more and feared the rest of the group could burst in at any minute and rape her as well. ‚ÄúRape is the most natural thing in the world,‚Äù and ‚Äúwomen must obey men,‚Äù were just two of the defenses offered by some of the seven Muslim invaders recently arrested for a gang rape of an unconscious 17-year-old white girl in Ostend, Belgium However, despite the aggressive nature of the attack, the migrant has been spared jail. Handing him a suspended sentence, the judge also fined the Iranian ¬£3,680 in compensation to the girl and her family. The sentencing comes just days after an Iraqi asylum seeker had his rape conviction overturned , after his defence lawyers claimed he did not know his 10-year-old victim did not want to be raped.",1
"DEAD MUSLIMS SOCIETY will sue to force small Massachusetts town to allocate space for 16,000 dead Muslims","DEAD MUSLIMS SOCIETY will sue to force small Massachusetts town to allocate space for 16,000 dead Muslims Negotiations to put a Muslim cemetery in the small town of Dudley have broken down in acrimony, and the contentious issue ‚Äî replete with charges and countercharges of bigotry and grandstanding ‚Äî appears to be headed for resolution in the courts, aided and abetted by the litigation jihadists of designated terrorist group CAIR. Boston Globe The Islamic Society of Greater Worcester ended talks this week after the Board of Selectmen did not accept its latest proposal for a graveyard on 55 acres of abandoned farmland , according to the society‚Äôs attorney. A counter-offer by the town also was not accepted. Neither side provided details of the private discussions. People are opposed to casket free Muslim burials which could contaminate the water supply Jay Talerman, the Islamic Society attorney, said Thursday the group will now pursue the plan in the courts, following a 10-month process that failed to produce an agreement but generated plenty of heated rhetoric. ‚ÄúEach time, the selectmen retreated to a position that involved violating my client‚Äôs rights,‚Äù Talerman said. ‚ÄúThe most disappointing part appears to be that they never sincerely or genuinely had any intention to accommodate us.‚Äù (What a surprise. NOT) A suit filed by the society is pending in Massachusetts Land Court. In addition, the ACLU of Massachusetts is preparing to file a civil rights suit in US District Court, said Sarah Wunsch, the organization‚Äôs deputy legal director. The Obama thugs of the US Attorney‚Äôs Office in Boston already has launched an investigation into whether civil rights violations occurred. The state Attorney General‚Äôs office has been in talks with both sides. The town‚Äôs attorney, Gary Brackett, said that the issue always has been about the size and impact of the cemetery ‚Äî not whether one would be permitted. Throughout the process, Talerman said, ‚Äúthe selectmen never expressed a willingness to abandon procedures that are a direct affront to my clients.‚Äù Brackett denounced Talerman‚Äôs repeated accusations that anti-Muslim bias tainted the cemetery application. Large crowds have come out to every meeting to protest the proposed cemetery ‚ÄúI would compare Mr. Talerman‚Äôs broad-brush claims regarding the citizens and officials of the town of Dudley as being the equivalent of Donald Trump‚Äôs attempt at portraying Muslims,‚Äù Brackett said. Dr. Amjad Bahnassi, the president of the Islamic Society, said he attributed part of the opposition to a ‚Äúmisunderstanding‚Äù of the Muslim religion and said the issue has become a civil rights concern for many of the estimated 5,000 Muslims in Worcester County. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre being denied unfairly what is granted to us by the law,‚Äù Bahnassi said. At issue is the Islamic Society‚Äôs attempt to buy farmland with enough space for an estimated 16,000 graves that, if filled, would be the largest Muslim cemetery in the state. The society currently uses a graveyard in Enfield, Conn., 60 miles from Worcester, which Muslim leaders said poses a hardship for many families. When the society‚Äôs plans became public early this year, townspeople expressed fears that burials would contaminate well water, because Muslims traditionally do not use coffins, and that the nearby rural roads would become congested. Muslim leaders continued to pursue their application through town government, even though Talerman said the society was not required to seek approval because the organization is a religious group seeking the land for a religious purpose. The town‚Äôs Zoning Board of Appeals rejected the cemetery application in June, and the Islamic Society filed suit in Land Court. The town also began efforts to buy the land under a right of first refusal for certain agricultural property. However, the Islamic Society, which already had signed a purchase-and-sale agreement for the property, argued again that the town had no such right. Facing intensifying pressure, the town eventually waived that claim. On Thursday, Talerman reiterated his longstanding contention that bigotry lies behind the lack of an agreement. ‚ÄúWe gave this town an opportunity to lock arms with us and welcome a benign use into their town that would dispel any notion that they were biased or bigoted,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúThey have not taken up the olive branch and instead have doubled down on strategies that are solely intended to delay or kill our project.‚Äù (Yes, and once Trump is in office you can take your lawsuit and stuff it) RELATED STORIES/VIDEOS:",1

"FRANCE: Police are under siege in Muslim migrant areas in and around Paris, also known as ‚ÄúNO-GO Zones‚Äù","BNI Store Oct 29 2016 FRANCE: Police are under siege in Muslim migrant areas in and around Paris, also known as ‚ÄúNO-GO Zones‚Äù Despite President Francois Hollande‚Äôs continued insistence that there aren‚Äôt any Muslim NO-GO Zones in France, police say otherwise. NO-GO Zones are violent and lawless Muslim migrant dominated neighborhoods around Paris that are virtually off limits to non-Muslims and a threat to police and firefighters. Gatestone (h/t Brenda K) There is a mountain of evidence that confirms the existence of Muslim ‚ÄòNO GO ZONES‚Äô (Zones Urbaines Sensibles) where non-Muslims are afraid to go because they regularly are attacked by gangs of Muslims who rule these lawless neighborhoods. Host-country authorities have effectively lost control over many no-go zones and are often unable or unwilling to provide even basic public aid, such as police, fire fighting and ambulance services, out of fear of being attacked by Muslim youth. Muslim enclaves in European cities are also breeding grounds for Islamic radicalism and pose a significant threat to Western security. Europe‚Äôs no-go zones are the by-product of decades of multicultural policies that have encouraged Muslim immigrants to create parallel societies and remain segregated from ‚Äî rather than become integrated into ‚Äî their European host nations. A 120-page research paper entitled ‚ÄúNo-Go Zones in the French Republic: Myth or Reality?‚Äù documented dozens of French neighborhoods ‚Äúwhere police and gendarmerie cannot enforce the Republican order or even enter without risking confrontation, projectiles, or even fatal shootings.‚Äù A landmark 2,200-page report, ‚ÄúBanlieue de la R√©publique‚Äù (Suburbs of the Republic) found that Seine-Saint-Denis and other Parisian suburbs are becoming ‚Äúseparate Islamic societies‚Äù cut off from the French state, and where Islamic Sharia law is rapidly displacing French civil law. The report said that Muslim immigrants are increasingly rejecting French values and instead are immersing themselves in literal violent Islam. The problem of no-go zones is well documented, but multiculturalists and their politically correct supporters vehemently deny that they exist. Some are now engaged in a concerted campaign to discredit and even silence those who draw attention to the issue. A 120-page research paper entitled ‚ÄúNo-Go Zones in the French Republic: Myth or Reality?‚Äù documented dozens of French neighborhoods ‚Äúwhere police and gendarmerie cannot enforce the Republican order or even enter without risking confrontation, projectiles, or even fatal shootings.‚Äù In October 2011, a 2,200-page report, ‚ÄúBanlieue de la R√©publique‚Äù (Suburbs of the Republic) found that Seine-Saint-Denis and other Parisian suburbs are becoming ‚Äúseparate Islamic societies‚Äù cut off from the French state and where Islamic Sharia law is rapidly displacing French civil law. The report also showed how the problem is being exacerbated by radical Muslim preachers who are promoting the social marginalization of Muslim immigrants in order to create a parallel Muslim society in France that is ruled by Sharia law. The television presenter asks: ‚ÄúWhat if we went to the suburbs?‚Äù Obertone replies: ‚ÄúI do not recommend this. Not even we French dare go there anymore. But nobody talks about this in public, of course. Nor do those who claim, ‚Äòlong live multiculturalism,‚Äô and ‚ÄòParis is wonderful!‚Äô dare enter the suburbs.‚Äù Back in 2015, the Mayor of Paris threatened to sue FOX News for reporting on the problem of Muslim NO-GO Zones. As a result, several FOX commentators were forced to issue apologies on the air for claiming after the Charlie Hebdo attack that there are Muslim-ruled ‚Äúno-go zones‚Äù in France.

ITALY: African Muslim illegal alien freeloaders are demanding to have designer clothes and better food,"ITALY: African Muslim illegal alien freeloaders are demanding to have designer clothes and better food African MUSLIM illegal migrants who took the streets in protest and blocked traffic in Venice this week are now demanding real designer clothes (Armani and Hugo Boss), no knockoffs, and say they don‚Äôt like having to eat so much pasta in their meals. Breitbart (h/t Emma) Lorenzo Chinalleto, whose cooperative hosts migrants at the Hotel Byron in the Venice province, said migrants respond with displeasure when receiving clothes from Catholic charity Caritas and other charitable bodies, because the goods are unbranded. He explained: ‚ÄúUnfortunately they come to Italy with the asylum reception systems of northern Europe as a model. When they arrived we gave them clothes, standard clothes. ‚ÄúBut they want brand-name clothes like Armani and Boss, and they asked for Pirelli shoes. These are their models. When they came to us, they didn‚Äôt have clothes, but they all had smartphones,‚Äù the Italian added . Forty of the migrants hosted at the Hotel Byron took to the streets to express their dissatisfaction, blocking the traffic. In a video (below) taken outside the hotel on Monday protesters can be seen shouting, in English, that they don‚Äôt want to eat pasta. The migrants originate mostly from Senegal, Nigeria, Somalia, Mali and Ghana, Il Gazzettino reported . Migrants frequently hit the headlines in Italy protesting their living conditions in the country, which has recently been hit hard by several earthquakes. In May a group of ‚Äúunaccompanied minors‚Äù launched a violent protest in order to be transferred from Fondachelli Fantina, complaining that there were ‚Äútoo few entertainment possibilities‚Äù in the town. After they had completely destroyed the reception centre to the point where it cannot be used again, the Interior Ministry transferred the migrants to a luxury hotel. In June migrants staying in a small town in Sardinia protested for several days demanding better meals, a television set in every room, and a daily coach to take them to the island‚Äôs capital, Cagliari. Tensions in the town ran high as the migrants brandished sticks and smashed property. Regional director of the populist Sardinian Action Party, Marcello Orr√π, commented on the controversy. He said: ‚ÄúIt is intolerable for us to continue to accept these people who don‚Äôt like the welcome offered, the meals and their lodgings at the hotel for free. And who then protest to have a television in the room and a daily bus take them to Cagliari for free. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs too easy to accuse us of racism and xenophobia, but we refuse to accept this total and grave injustice to the Sardinian people. These boys are muscular and equipped with the latest model iPhones. ‚ÄúI say if they want a TV in the room and maybe even a masseuse, they must be loaded on a ship and sent back to Africa immediately. With a one-way ticket‚Äù.",1
Why Iranian-American pastor held hostage in Iran is voting for Donald Trump,"Why Iranian-American pastor held hostage in Iran is voting for Donald Trump Iranian-American Pastor Saeed Abedini is brimming with gratitude for one U.S. presidential aspirant: Donald Trump. Christian Today In a surprising revelation, Abedini said the Republican presidential nominee helped provide for the needs of his family in Boise, Idaho while he was locked up in an Iranian prison for his faith. The pastor said Trump gave his family $10,000 while he was imprisoned for three and a half years. ‚ÄúI am finally free in a free country. Last year on the same day I was sick and in chains for Christ, and now I can vote to choose my next president,‚Äù Abedini said in a post on his Facebook page on Sunday. ‚ÄúAnd most amazingly, I can vote for someone that I know fought for me and called my name so many times. He met my family and gave them a $10,000 gift. I think his ideas are more biblical than the other candidates,‚Äù he added. In contrast, Abedini said Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton did not do or say anything to help secure his release from Iranian prison. The pastor said Clinton never spoke his name or met his family. Abedini family As a woman who says she stands for women‚Äôs rights when she was foreign minister, she never contacted my mom, wife, sister or my daughter. She never did anything to help when I was in prison as an American pastor who was detained in Iran as a hostage,‚Äù he wrote. (Probably because she was too busy figuring out how to get more Iranian Muslims into the country) Last week, Abedini said he already cast an early vote for Trump in the 2016 presidential election.",1
UNIDENTIFIED (MUSLIM?) ‚Äòknifeman‚Äô on the run after stabbing four people at a Frankfurt train station,"UNIDENTIFIED (MUSLIM?) ‚Äòknifeman‚Äô on the run after stabbing four people at a Frankfurt train station The attack this afternoon occurred at Hauptwache Station and police have said there are four victims. At this stage the motive for the stabbings is not clear. ( It will become crystal clear once you identify the attacker as a Muslim ) UK Daily Mail (h/t larr) The local police force confirmed the attack by Tweeting: ‚ÄòThere was a knife assault at the #Hauptwache in #Frankfurt. ‚ÄòThat‚Äôs why so many colleagues [police officers] and rescue workers there.‚Äô Frankfurt Police confirmed all four victims were still in hospital. A video of the bloody aftermath was captured on what is understood to be level B of the station. The incident was at 5.30pm local time, according to Hessenschau , who report the stabbings came after a group were quarreling. A dispute had started on one platform and spilled over onto another one. There was more bloodshed in a separate incident at the station, understood to be on a passenger train between Hauptwache and Taunusanlage. A dispute between two passengers broke out into a fight, according to Hessenschau , which led to glass being broken and people suffering cuts. Frankfurt police looked to reassure the public by tweeting: ‚ÄúIf we recognized a threat to the local population we would communicate this.‚Äù (No, you wouldn‚Äôt) The stabbings will still raise fears the attack was ISLAMIC terror-related after a string of incidents across Europe over recent months. Germany has been rocked by ISLAMIC terror attacks this year, heaping pressure on chancellor Angela Merkel‚Äôs open-door MUSLIM immigration policy. A bloody week of violence that rocked Germany began on July 18 when Pakistani MUSLIM teenager Riaz Khan Ahmadzai, 17, posing as an Afghan refugee, hacked at passengers on a train in Wurzburg with an axe, wounding five. Four days later, a German-Iranian MUSLIM teenager Ali Sonboly shot nine people dead during a rampage through a shopping centre in Munich before taking his own life.

EU using taxpayer money to give Muslim invaders in Turkey free debit cards and cash transfers to keep them out of Europe,"BNI Store Oct 29 2016 EU using taxpayer money to give Muslim invaders in Turkey free debit cards and cash transfers to keep them out of Europe As many as one million illegal alien Muslim colonizers in Turkey will receive debit cards and monthly cash transfers to help pay for food and housing under a new ‚Ç¨348 million ($393 million) humanitarian program from the European Union. ZeroHedge The EU‚Äôs largest-ever humanitarian program is part of a ‚Ç¨3 billion package of assistance the bloc promised Turkey to support some three million refugees the country hosts, mainly from Syria. The new EU program will be overseen by the World Food Program, in cooperation with the Turkish Red Crescent. Each family‚Äôs need will be assessed individually and there are additional funds available for education or supporting elderly family members. Step-by-Step Progression into a sinkhole for the EU More refugees will seek free handouts. Turkey will complain ‚Ç¨3 billion is not enough. The refugees will complain ‚Ç¨1,000 is not enough. EU citizens will wonder why refugees are getting ‚Ç¨1,000 and they are not. Demands for an EU-wide helicopter drop of free debit cards will soar. The amounts demanded will soar. Some economist will propose the debit cards will expire if not used quickly. And then, and then ‚Ä¶.Under Eurozone rules the ECB cannot simply print money and give it away. Countries have budget constraints. So, either taxes go up to pay for the scheme, or the EMU rules have to change. Western media are reporting on the Muslim refugee crisis as a humanitarian problem for the West only. But where are the media questions about the huge financial and land resources available in the Arab Gulf states of Saudi Arabia, Qatar, Kuwait, and the UAE? So far, the richest Arab Muslim countries in the Middle East have taken in virtually no Muslim refugees. Liveleak The world is often lectured to about the urgency of respecting Arab and Islamic brotherly love, but where is the Arab action to rescue fellow Muslims and Arabs from the claws of ISIS? Where are the mighty Arab armies who waged dozens of wars against Israel? Why aren‚Äôt they fighting ISIS and building tent cities in the vast deserts of Arabia, Egypt, Jordan and the wealthy Gulf States? Where is the wealthy Arab League to coordinate safe cities on Arab land that extends from Morocco to Iraq and from Northern Syria to Sudan? Kuwaiti official explains why Kuwait will NOT take in any Syrian refugees ‚ÄúKuwait and other oil-rich Muslim countries are too valuable to accept low-class Muslim refugees who we will have to support because they don‚Äôt want to work. We don‚Äôt want people who are different from us.‚Äù",1

DONALD TRUMP attorney searching for homeless woman who was attacked by Clinton supporters for guarding Trump‚Äôs star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame,"BNI Store Oct 29 2016 The attorney for Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump is looking for the homeless Black woman seen on video being attacked by a mob of Hillary Clinton supporters as she protected Trump‚Äôs star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame after it was sledgehammered by a Clinton supporter earlier this week. Videos of the abuse show people yelling at the woman and knocking her to the ground as the insults continue. RT Michael Cohen, Trump Organization EVP and Special Counsel to Donald J. Trump, spoke out on Twitter Friday evening about Mr. Trump‚Äôs desire‚Äìbefore it was known to him that she was attacked by the Clinton mob‚Äìto present an unspecified gift to the woman. Cohen said he had a friend in Hollywood looking for her. After learning she had been attacked, Cohen promised she would have ‚Äúthe last laugh on these thugs.‚Äù . @ClydeStones she deserves to be treated with dignity and compassion. 
‚Äî Michael Cohen (@MichaelCohen212) October 29, 2016 A number of videos titled ‚ÄòCrazy 4 Trump‚Äô posted on YouTube show a crowd of people surrounding the woman as she holds up banners in support for the Republican presidential nominee. Her hand-written signs promote pro-Trump messages like ‚ÄúTwenty million illegals and Americans sleep on the streets in tents‚Äù and ‚ÄúDonald Trump ‚Äì keeping it real‚Äù. . @DiamondandSilk @realDonaldTrump someone please help me locate this woman as Mr. Trump has a gift for her‚Ä¶ 
‚Äî Michael Cohen (@MichaelCohen212) October 28, 2016 Some of the banners included provocative language, including one targeting the US president, reading, ‚ÄúObama threw our black asses under the bus, he owes the Clintons, flip this script (get off the Clinton plantation).‚Äù A crowd on Hollywood Boulevard, not a hotspot for Trump supporters, did not share the woman‚Äôs political preferences. Nor did they choose to let her be. People are heard yelling insults at the woman, but one man temporarily stops the insults. His words calmed the crowd briefly, but verbal abuses continued as someone started accusing the woman of ‚Äúspewing‚Äù hate. Soon, the situation turned violent, with some physically assaulting the woman and damaging her property. She was knocked off her feet, her cart overturned and her banners torn to pieces.",1
SWEDEN HELP WANTED: Activities Coordinator for bored illegal alien Muslim freeloaders and rapists,"SWEDEN HELP WANTED: Activities Coordinator for bored illegal alien Muslim freeloaders and rapists Muslim illegal alien invaders taking up space in Sweden and living off the government dole, say they are vandalizing and burning cars (not to mention gang-raping Swedish girls) because they do not have enough ‚Äúactivities‚Äù to keep them busy. Friatider ‚ÄúIt is clear as hell that we take out our frustration by destroying and vandalizing when we have a shortage of activities here,‚Äù one of the illegals living in Skallberget in Vasteras writes in a letter to the editor in the local newspaper VLT. Vasteras has recently been subjected to a long series of car fires. The submitter tries the young man, who wishes to remain anonymous, explain what the phenomenon is due.

GERMAN ‚ÄòGESTAPO‚Äô considers prosecuting parents who refused to allow their son to go on a field trip to mosque,"BNI Store Oct 30 2016 GERMAN ‚ÄòGESTAPO‚Äô considers prosecuting parents who refused to allow their son to go on a field trip to mosque Parents of a German teenager may face a trial for refusing to pay ‚Äòtruancy‚Äô fine after refusing to allow their son to go to a local mosque on a school field trip out of fear that it would lead to his indoctrination by Muslim leaders. RT The story broke in mid-June, when parents of a 13-year-old student opposed the idea of their son visiting a mosque in the northern German town of Rendsburg, reportedly organized as part of a geography class. ‚ÄúWhat a trip to the mosque has to do with geography classes?‚Äù Arthur Dent asked. Others compared the authorities‚Äô actions to the darkest part of German history, with one user tweeting: ‚ÄúVisiting mosques is a top priority under our regime, similar to having a Fuhrer‚Äôs image in everyone‚Äôs flat.‚Äù In a letter to the class teacher quoted by the NDR, the teen‚Äôs father argued that his son would be ‚Äúindoctrinated‚Äù in the mosque. He went on to say that ‚Äúfor years we have been hearing reports about religiously-motivated violence connected with Islamic people.‚Äù The parents‚Äô lawyer, Alexander Heumann, argues that they refused the school trip out of fear for their son‚Äôs ‚Äúbodily safety.‚Äù Denying any faith-based motives, he emphasized that the couple do not belong to any religious group, and are of the opinion that ‚Äúnobody shall be forced into a sacred place against his good will.‚Äù Heumann himself, however, is a former member of the Alternative for Germany party, an anti-immigrant political group, and was a participant in setting up the ‚ÄòDugida,‚Äô a Dusseldorf-based branch of the far-right PEGIDA movement. According to the NDR report, the parents met the lawyer through the ‚ÄòPax Europa‚Äô movement, a civic group which opposes the perceived ‚ÄúIslamization of Europe.‚Äù A local education authority subsequently fined the couple a total of ‚Ç¨300 ($328). When the parents opposed the fine, their case was forwarded to Peter Mueller-Rakow, a local prosecutor, who will decide whether or not to proceed with a court trial.",1
KANSAS: Republican Mailer asks voters ‚ÄúHave you met the new neighbors?‚Äù (your ‚ÄòMuslim terrorist‚Äô neighbors),"KANSAS: Republican Mailer asks voters ‚ÄúHave you met the new neighbors?‚Äù (your ‚ÄòMuslim terrorist‚Äô neighbors) The Kansas Republican Party is sending out mailers in legislative races around the state depicting ISIS fighters and explosions from MUSLIM terrorist attacks. A mailer going to homes in east Wichita‚Äôs House District 88 shows an ISIS fighter holding a machine gun with a message that reads: ‚ÄúHave you met the new neighbors?‚Äù Wichita Eagle The other side of the mailer touts Republican Rep. Joseph Scapa‚Äôs support for funding to train Kansas law enforcement officers to ‚Äúrecognize and deal with foreign and domestic threats to our state, from those who support ideologies that are in conflict with the U.S. Constitution and our Kansas values.‚Äù Clay Barker, executive director of the Kansas Republican Party, said similar mailers are being sent out around the state. ‚ÄúWe did polling and focus groups, and the one issue that got overwhelming positive response and was associated with Republicans was safety,‚Äù Barker said. ‚ÄúYou know, Gitmo, that article that came out back in August that ISIS had named soldiers for assassinations, police being shot and those knuckleheads in Garden City, it all kind of added up to a security issue ‚Ä¶ the whole feeling that‚Äôs there violence out there. And it‚Äôs a positive issue for Republicans.‚Äù The Republican mailer specifically depicts ISIS, the Islamic terror group that controls parts of Syria and Iraq. Robert McCraw, director of government affairs for the designated terrorist group CAIR (Council on American-Islamic Relations) in Washington, D.C., called the mailers ‚Äúa shameful example of scare mongering tactics that I hope the Republican Party can learn to move away from.‚Äù He said it was appalling for the state party ‚Äúto falsely insinuate that the state‚Äôs Muslim population is linked to terror groups like ISIS.‚Äù ‚ÄúThis flier verges on incitement of violence to Muslims.‚Äù The Republican-controlled Legislature has passed resolutions opposing the possible transfer of Guantanamo detainees to Fort Leavenworth. Barker said there are several variations of the mailers. One depicts an explosion from a terrorist attack. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs one of the few (issues) that was a clear, like high 80 percent positive and associated with Republicans,‚Äù Barker said. It‚Äôs not only Republicans who don‚Äôt want Gitmo terrorists in Kansas Barker also said the party is sending out mailers highlighting Republicans‚Äô support for ousting four of the sitting Kansas Supreme Court justices, portraying Democrats who support retaining the justices as soft on crime. Rep. Joseph Scapa, who said he saw the mailer before it was sent out, focused his comments about the mailer more on Muslim refugees, who he says pose a potential security threat. ‚ÄúWe have people coming into our state from parts of the world who believe in ideologies that are incompatible with the United States Constitution and our Kansas values and that poses a threat,‚Äù Scapa said. ‚ÄúWe know for a fact that we cannot vet the people that are coming into our state from other parts of the world ‚Ä¶ where they believe in ideologies that we don‚Äôt.‚Äù 20-year-old Kansas Muslim convert John T. Booker, Jr., could face life in prison for allegedly plotting to bomb a U.S. military base. Scapa‚Äôs opponent, Democrat Elizabeth Bishop, criticized the mail campaign, saying the mailers could contribute to animosity toward Muslims in Wichita. (One can only hope) Led by Republican Governor Sam Brownback the state of Kansas informed the Obama administration this week that it is defying its dictates for Kansas to cooperate in the resettlement of refugees from Syria. In a letter to Robert Carey, director of the Office of Refugee Resettlement, Brownback wrote, ‚ÄúThe State of Kansas hereby withdraws its Refugee Resettlement Program State Plan and terminates its participation in all federal refugee resettlement grants and programs, effective at the earliest possible date.‚Äù Hopefully, they are the last Brownback added that he was taking his action to ‚Äúprotect the safety and security interests of the State of Kansas.‚Äù",1

NETHERLANDS has a new Muslim political party called ‚ÄòDENK‚Äô (Think) created by Muslim colonizers for Muslim colonizers,"NETHERLANDS has a new Muslim political party called ‚ÄòDENK‚Äô (Think) created by Muslim colonizers for Muslim colonizers Founded by 2 Turkish Muslims, Tunahan Kuzu and Sel√ßuk √ñzt√ºrk, after being booted out of the Dutch Labour Party, the Denk Partij (Think Party) is the first political force in Europe established by Muslims and is attracting controversy for its affiliation with the Turkish Islamist regime, rejection of the Armenian Genocide, and radical anti-Israel positions. DENK is also proposing a 1,000 strong ‚Äòracism‚Äô police and national anti-immigration registry which will target anyone who says anything ‚ÄòIslamophobic‚Äô against Muslims. Legal Insurrection is reporting ( h/t Truth Revolt ) that the Netherlands‚Äô pro-Muslim immigration Denk Party is pushing for a thousand-strong ‚ÄúRacism Police‚Äù to go after thought and speech crimes against Muslims which would result in a registry for offenders, fines, and re-education camps. The party, dominated by members of Turkish and Muslim origin was founded in 2014 by two former-socialist Turkish politicians but it already sits in the Dutch parliament and is hoping to mobilize the country‚Äôs million-strong mainly Muslim immigrant population (out of about 17 million overall) and growing Muslim population, currently at about 7 percent, in the parliamentary elections to be held early next year. Tunahan Kuzu and Sel√ßuk √ñzt√ºrk Among the Denk Party‚Äôs latest proposals are the renaming of streets and tunnels suggestive of Dutch colonial and slave trading history, changing the term ‚Äúforeigner‚Äù to ‚ÄúTurkish and Surinamese Dutch person,‚Äù creating a thousand-man ‚ÄúRacism Police,‚Äù establishing stricter sentences for ‚Äúracist and discriminatory behavior,‚Äù and listing offenders on a nationwide ‚ÄúRacism Register‚Äù ‚Äî you know, just like child molesters. This multicultural champion has close ties to Erdogan‚Äôs Turkish-Islamist AKP party and it refuses to recognize the genocide of Armenian Christians. According to a recent Dutch poll, nearly 90 percent of young Turkish-Dutch sympathize with ISIS ‚Äî 90 percent . This is the Denk Party‚Äôs political base. Denk Party stands in the tradition of George Galloway‚Äôs Respect Party in UK, a new mutant ideology taking root in Europe that fuses leftist ‚Äúsocial justice‚Äù issues with political Islam, dipped in fierce hatred for Israel and Western heritage. Last month, the Denk Party attracted media attention when party‚Äôs leader and Dutch MP Tunahan Kuzu refused to shake hands with the visiting Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netenyahu. What should worry the freedom-loving people ‚Äî on the either side of the Atlantic ‚Äî is not just the outrageous nature of Denk Party‚Äôs proposals, but the determined effort already underway in Europe to criminalize ‚Äúundesired‚Äù speech and political dissident. The E.U. has long been pressuring its media to omit mentions of Islam when Muslims are involved in terrorism. UK Express DENK proposes a ban on words like ‚Äònative‚Äô and ‚Äòimmigrant‚Äô would be introduced, alongside a national holiday to celebrate Muslim diversity. The party aims to reinvent Dutch national identity, and the program is geared towards tackling the institutional racism/Islamophobia it says is endemic in the Netherlands. And part of that is scrapping the government‚Äôs ideals of integration, claiming this should not be expected of Muslim migrants, but rather an atmosphere of ‚Äòmutual acceptance‚Äô should be adopted. (In other words, forcing Dutch natives to give up their customs and culture and accommodate the Muslim way of doing things) Tackling racism/Islamophobia should begin in schools, with pro-Islam attitudes promoted in the classroom through citizenship classes, and that students are regularly tested to see if they are meeting the required benchmark.",1
It isn‚Äôt ‚ÄòIslamophobia‚Äô when an Oklahoma GOP State Rep. says ‚ÄúIslam is a cancer in our nation that needs to be cut out‚Äù,"BNI Store Oct 31 2016 It isn‚Äôt ‚ÄòIslamophobia‚Äô when an Oklahoma GOP State Rep. says ‚ÄúIslam is a cancer in our nation that needs to be cut out‚Äù Unfortunately, some Christians in Oklahoma, where there has been one savage beheading of a Christian woman by a Muslim and at least one other beheading attempt, seem to think so, and blindly condemn all outspoken critics of Islam‚Ä¶especially the Christians. Nondoc Whining about so-called ‚ÄúIslamophobia is exactly what James Davenport, a Christian political science professor of at Rose State College, is doing . Specifically, he attacks State Rep. John Bennett for holding an interim stud y this past week on the impact of ‚Äúradical Islam, Shariah Law, the Muslim Brotherhood and the radicalization process‚Äù on Oklahoma and the nation. During the course of this study, Rep. Bennett referred to Adam Soltani, the executive director for designated terrorist group CAIR (Council on American-Islamic Relations chapter of Oklahoma), and Imam Imad Enchassi, of the Islamic Society of Greater Oklahoma City, as ‚Äúterrorists.‚Äù As someone who grew up in the Evangelical Christian tradition, and as someone who believes religious freedom remains a fundamental principle of our system of government, I am both offended and saddened at this spectacle. I am offended that a state representative from my state would use the cloak of Christianity to spew hate and bigotry such as this. I am also offended that he would do so while arguing he is defending freedom. Imam Enchassi then got up from his seat in the audience and hugged two members of other faiths who were in attendance. Bennett asked Rep. Randy Grau, R-Edmond, chairman of the Judiciary and Civil Procedure Committee, to admonish members of the audience not to hug a Muslim. In fact, during one exchange between Bennett and Imam Enchassi, the Imam stated, ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a free country,‚Äù to which Bennett, who served in the U.S. Marines replied, ‚ÄúI know, I fought for it in two wars.‚Äù John Guandolo, the founder of UnderstandingtheThreat.com , who served in the Marines and is a former FBI agent, said the Islamic movement in Oklahoma has made significant strides, and he called CAIR-Oklahoma executive director Adam Soltani a terrorist. Under questioning from Bennett, Guandolo said groups in the country‚Äôs jihadi network use relationships with other faiths as a tool. But one wonders what, exactly, Bennett fought for. It clearly wasn‚Äôt freedom. Neither freedom of religion nor freedom of association seem high on his list of priorities, especially if you happen to be a member of Islam. Perhaps he was fighting for Christianity. The problem with that line of reasoning is there rests absolutely no instruction in the New Testament for believers to physically fight for Christ, or for the faith. In fact, if one were to hold strictly to Christ‚Äôs own words on this, one could easily reach the conclusion that Christ expects us not to fight for him (read John 18:36 ). So if Bennett wasn‚Äôt fighting for freedom, and he wasn‚Äôt fighting for Christianity, what was he fighting for? Perhaps he should spend more time reading the history of his own faith rather than fretting about the supposed threat from Muslims. He would find that this combining of religion and state power never ends well ‚Äî for anyone. I also mentioned I was saddened by this event. That sadness comes from the fact that I know I will receive pushback from members of my own faith community on this matter. I will be told I do not understand the true threat posed by Islam. I‚Äôll also be told I‚Äôve been blinded to the truth by my immersion in the liberal world of academia. Too many Evangelicals have been convinced by opportunistic political and religious leaders that any acknowledgement or accommodation of Islam is a threat to Christianity itself. I disagree. If allowing others to freely practice their faith, if providing (special and excessive) accommodations to those of Islam and if refusing to use the levers of government to intimidate, harass or oppress minority faiths (the one faith determined to subjugate and dominate those of every other faith) is a threat to Christianity, we Christians have bigger problems than we know. 
If Christians want to have real influence on our society ‚Äî if we want to spread the good news of God‚Äôs love ‚Äî we must reject the type of political religion promoted by Rep. Bennett and his ilk. We must stand with those of other faiths and affirm that, unlike some in the Oklahoma Legislature , we believe all people of faith are entitled to practice their religion freely without fear of official sanction. ‚ÄúIf you are concerned that there are some who wish to destroy the Christian faith, follow Christ‚Äôs instructions: ‚ÄúLove your enemies! Do good to those who hate you. Bless those who curse you. Pray for those who hurt you‚Ä¶You must be compassionate, just as your Father is compassionate.‚Äù ( Luke 6:27-36 ) (And we see how well that idea has worked out for Christians in the Middle East who are very close to becoming extinct because of the ethnic cleansing by the Muslim majority) RELATED STORIES/VIDEOS:",1
SWEDISH OUTRAGE as Muslim colonizers get preference for housing while native Swedes are out in the cold,"A Swedish MP has lashed out after it was revealed Muslim freeloaders posing as refugees would be allowed to jump ahead of Swedish families in the housing queue. NOT ANYMORE! UK Express Earlier this month Express.co.uk reported several councils in the Scandinavian country are prioritising the requests of asylum seekers ahead of their own citizens, with Muslim migrants given housing straight away, despite Swedes being placed on a huge waiting list. Now 20 accommodations in Klippan, in south Sweden, are being prepared for Muslim migrants after a new policy demanded all available apartments owned by the municipal property company be put aside for asylum seekers. The move has been criticised by Therese Borg, of the Swedish Democrats (SD) party, as she argued the Muslim invaders should be placed on the list and wait their turn. Ms Borg said asylum seekers urgently needed to be placed on the list alongside regular people because hardworking citizens risked growing resentful of the preferential treatment. She told Nyheteridag : ‚ÄúYou can see a lot of comments on Facebook. People are pissed off. ‚ÄúThere are a lot of teenagers living at home and who are looking for [a small apartment] to move into as it is a good place to start [building a life]. ‚ÄúThe small apartments are necessary for [the youth] moving out, but they are not offered them unless the newly arrivals decline to take the property.‚Äù Meanwhile aid workers helping migrants say they have been terrified by Muslim attacks which have left them too scared to leave their homes. The SD politician also said the council should start focusing on the migrants already living in the area, rather than focusing funds on asylum seekers who might arrive in the future. Lashing out against the Government and Migration Board, Ms Borg demanded they take responsibility for the migrants they have allowed into the country. Even worse, a lot of Swedish families are being kicked out of their homes in order to accommodate Muslim freeloaders: However, Bert-Inge Karlsson, of the Christian Democrats, blasted Ms Borg‚Äôs comments as he insisted her portrayal of the situation was out-of-touch with reality. Mr Karlsson said: ‚ÄúI [question] the way Theresa Borg has portrayed it as if we have an extraordinary housing crisis in the nation. How is it then possible for us to take in so incredibly many. ‚ÄúShe has returned to the kind of insinuation‚Ä¶ which suggests the entire world could be on its way here.‚Äù In March this year, Sweden passed a law requiring all municipalities accept and provide housing for migrants, allowing families and others on the waiting to be placed at the back of the queue. The turmoil nation, which has been plagued with increasing levels of violence and criminal activity , with three police officers quitting each day , is experiencing chronic housing shortages as a result of the country‚Äôs generous asylum and migration policies over the last decade.",1
UK citizens and war heroes get cheap pre-fab houses while Muslim colonizers get taxpayer-funded luxurious council homes,"UK citizens and war heroes get cheap pre-fab houses while Muslim colonizers get taxpayer-funded luxurious council homes UK Ministers have been forced to put forward plans for pre-fabricated homes after 30,000 luxury council houses were handed out to unemployed illegal alien Muslim migrants. Migration Watch said the costs will continue to rocket if a ‚Äúsustainable‚Äù level of migration is not achieved. UK Daily Mail More than 11,000 households are raking in benefits that are at least the equivalent of a higher rate taxpayers‚Äô ¬£47,000 salary, it was revealed last month. According to official figures, thousands of Muslim migrant families on benefits are living in luxury homes, with many receiving housing handouts of about ¬£5,000 per month ‚Äì enough to fund a ¬£1million mortgage. Jonathan Isaby, of the TaxPayers‚Äô Alliance, said: ‚ÄòMany taxpayers struggling to make ends meet will find it incredibly unfair that some people are drawing more in benefits than they‚Äôve ever actually earned themselves. UK Express (h/t Rob E) A spokesperson said: ‚ÄúThere is a long standing controversy over the granting of social housing to immigrants. This has not been helped by local authorities‚Äô reluctance to publish the relevant information. ‚ÄúSome immigrant groups have very low use of social housing whereas others are more likely to be in social housing than the UK born. There is absolutely nothing in the rules that state that immigrants should get preferential treatment. ‚ÄúHowever, priority for social housing is largely determined by need and so some ‚Äòhigh need‚Äô immigrant families (with multiple wives and large litters of kids) will gain access to housing over longer standing local residents deemed to be of lower need. This can be contentious. The 100,000 pre-fab homes(below) proposed by the Government are a far cry from those properties ‚Äúfit for heroes‚Äù and service personnel who were awarded social housing on their return from the horrors of the First World War. ‚ÄúIn the future, any housing strategy must address both supply and demand. The Muslim invasion is a major part of housing demand. ‚ÄúUnless net migration is reduced to a manageable and sustainable level a large house building programme will have to continue indefinitely, with all the costs and loss of amenities involved.‚Äù A white paper due out next month includes measures to encourage banks to lend to firms which construct off-site before delivering them to their final destination. A Government source said: ‚ÄúThe first and most obvious advantage is speeding up the building of housing. ‚ÄúThere is pretty good evidence that if you did it at scale it is cheaper.‚Äù This has pushed ministers to plan a new wave of pre-made homes to solve the housing crisis. The prefabricated homes can be built off site in as little as a day and take just 48 hours to install on a site. Jonathan Isaby, of the TaxPayers‚Äô Alliance, said: ‚ÄòMany taxpayers struggling to make ends meet will find it incredibly unfair that some people are drawing more in benefits than they‚Äôve ever actually earned themselves.

ITALIAN MAYOR blasted for scathing verbal attack on African Muslim savages who have been invading Southern Italy,"ITALIAN MAYOR blasted for scathing verbal attack on African Muslim savages who have been invading Southern Italy Yes, his words may be racist and anti-Muslim, but look at the videos below to see what African Muslim illegal alien invaders are bringing to Italy and you won‚Äôt be so quick to condemn him. What would you say if they did the same thing in your cities? Thousands of Muslims lift their asses to Allah in front of the Coliseum in Rome to protest the government‚Äôs closing of hundreds of illegal mosques UK Express (h/t Brenda K) An Italian mayor has come under fire after saying he will shoot ‚Äôniggers and gypsies‚Äô and build a pig farm next to mosques as tensions continue to rise over the illegal alien Muslim invasion of southern Italy. More than 160,000 economic freeloaders posing as asylum seekers have been housed in Italy since the start of 2014, according to date from the interior ministry. Italy has been one of the first destinations along migrants typical routes for months, receiving thousands of new arrivals who continue to risk their lives to cross the Mediterranean on rickety smuggler‚Äôs boats. But many have been critical of the welcoming of so many refugees ‚Äì and now one Mayor from the town of Albettone in Vento has launched a scathing attack on the new arrivals. Speaking on La Zanzara on Radio 24, Joe Formaggio said: ‚ÄúImmigrants? If they send them to us, we will protect our houses.

ARIZONA Charter School teacher accused of harassment and assault of Somali Muslim student just because he is a Muslim,"BNI Store Nov 2 2016 ARIZONA Charter School teacher accused of harassment and assault of Somali Muslim student just because he is a Muslim Does anyone else smell the stench of designated terrorist group CAIR lurking in the shadows? A sixth grade teacher at the Academy of Excellence, a public charter school in Phoenix, allegedly said to a Muslim student: ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre a terrorist. I can‚Äôt wait until Trump is elected. He‚Äôs going to deport you all.‚Äù The ACLU has since filed complaints with the Obama Departments of Justice and Education. ABC15 The American Civil Liberties Union says a Somali Muslim immigrant and his sister were expelled from a Phoenix school after a sixth grade teacher allegedly discriminated against him. The complaints were made against Academy of Excellence Charter School, a public charter school in Phoenix. According to a letter sent to both state agencies, the 11-year-old student allegedly was targeted by his sixth grade teacher multiple times during the 2015-2016 school year. The letter accuses the teacher of singling out the student because of his religion and/or nationality. On one occasion, the teacher allegedly showed a video about the Sept. 11 2001 terrorist attacks. The teacher is accused of then telling the student ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs going to be you,‚Äù suggesting that he was to become a terrorist himself, ACLU attorney Heather Weaver said. Earlier in the school year, the same teacher had refused to let A.A. pray during class one day , and is also accused of grabbing the student by his neck and choking him because he would not stop talking with his classmates‚Ää. The letter said that, during a separate incident in which the teacher was speaking about Donald Trump, she turned to the student and said, ‚ÄúI can‚Äôt wait until Trump is elected. He‚Äôs going to deport all you Muslims. Muslims shouldn‚Äôt be given visas. They‚Äôll probably take away your visa and deport you. You‚Äôre going to be the next terrorist, I bet.‚Äù Because of the teacher‚Äôs comments claimed by the ACLU, the student allegedly was teased by classmates on the bus ride home that day and was accused of plotting to blow up the bus, calling him a ‚Äúterrorist.‚Äù She then allegedly threatened the student, saying ‚ÄúIf you tell your mom (about the abuse), watch what happens next.‚Äù The ACLU said that when the alleged victim‚Äôs mom complained to the school, the school director sided with the teacher, stating that she had done nothing wrong. The student was accused of breaking school rules by opening an emergency window while riding on the bus. As a result, both he and his sister ‚Äì a second grader at the same school ‚Äì were expelled; effective immediately. The complaints against the teacher were‚Äôt lodged until after the students‚Äô expulsion from the school. The Academy of Excellence Charter School is refuting the claims. They‚Äôve since released a statement regarding the situation, calling the allegations false. ‚ÄúThe Academy of Excellence Charter School Governing Board and Administration (‚ÄúAOE‚Äù) refutes the allegations contained in two letters from the ACLU. Those letters, both of which are dated October 28, 2016, are devoid of any evidence and contain false and unsubstantiated allegations. AOE conducted an internal investigation on January 25, 2016. That investigation produced no evidence to support the claims now being made . Additionally, these allegations were investigated by the Phoenix Police Department but at that time, her only complaint was that ‚Äúshe believed that her children were kicked out of our school due to their Muslim faith.‚Äù AOE has many children who practice the Muslim faith. It was not until February 24, 2016, that the mother and her son made the allegation of ‚Äòchoking.‚Äô This allegation was investigated by a Detective who found that, ‚ÄòAt the conclusion of the investigation, a crime in this matter was unfounded. Both suspect and witnesses provided corroborating statements, and were not consistent with the victims‚Äô statement.‚Äô This is the ‚Äúcursory and inadequate‚Äù investigation the ACLU notes in the footnotes to its letters. Finally, if you compare the timing of events contained in the ACLU‚Äôs letters and the statements made to the Police by the teacher and the student, they are completely different. The difference between the statements calls into question the motive of the plaintif. AOE‚Äôs first contact from the ACLU sought a substantial monetary payment.‚Äù (DING DING DING!

His remarkable threat marks another ratcheting up of the growing tensions between Rome and Brussels, whose friendship has been stretched to breaking point by the migration crisis. Italy has become the focal point for millions of migrants and refugees hoping to reach Europe ever since the route to Greece was effectively cut off by a repatriation deal with Turkey. More than 155,000 Muslim freeloaders posing as asylum seekers have arrived in the country this year alone after crossing the Mediterranean from Libya on rickety smugglers‚Äô boats. But Austria, Switzerland and France to the north have shored up their borders meaning almost all of those have become trapped in Italy, placing a huge strain on services and local communities. Speaking to the talk show Porta a Porta last night, Mr Renzi blasted: ‚ÄúEither we block the influx by 2017 or Italy will not handle another year like the past year.‚Äù And he warned: ‚ÄúRight now we can manage it. Winter is coming and sea conditions will worsen, but we have six months maximum.‚Äù Mr Renzi also strongly hinted that he will veto the EU budget in retaliation for the critical situation unless Brussels steps in and forces member states to take in their fair share of migrants. He blasted: ‚ÄúIf the Eastern countries who are growing with the help of our money do not open their doors to migrants as has been agreed, then we‚Äôll put a veto on the future European budget.‚Äù An EU Commission to impose migrant quotas on countries has run into difficulty following furious opposition from eastern European countries and a less than enthusiastic response from others already struggling with the pressures of mass migration. A number of member states including Hungary, which recently held a referendum where 98 per cent of voters rejected migrant quotas, are even taking legal proceedings against the EU in a bid to hold up the scheme. And Italy‚Äôs interior minister, Angelino Alfano, backed up Mr Renzi‚Äôs extraordinary ultimatum to veto the EU budget and withhold funds from Brussels unless it resolves the impasse. He said: ‚ÄúWe must use the veto. We give our money so that, in exchange for these duties, the others honour their commitments. ‚ÄúMoney does not go through walls. You know what? If they don‚Äôt help us, we will not give more money.‚Äù Referring to the country‚Äôs net budget contribution under its former leader, the technocrat Mario Monti, he added: ‚ÄúThe Monti government determined that we give 20 billion [euros] and receive 12, but if Hungary and Slovakia give us moral lessons about our money and then refuse to give us a hand on migrants, that doesn‚Äôt work.‚Äù",1
"BREAKING BOMBSHELL: NYPD blows whistle on new Hillary emails: Money Laundering, Pay to Play, Perjury, Sex Crimes with Children, Child Exploitation","BNI Store Nov 2 2016 BREAKING BOMBSHELL: NYPD blows whistle on new Hillary emails: Money Laundering, Pay to Play, Perjury, Sex Crimes with Children, Child Exploitation New York Police Department (NYPD) detectives and prosecutors working an alleged underage sexting case against former Congressman Anthony Weiner have turned over a newly-found laptop he shared with wife Huma Abedin to the FBI with enough evidence ‚Äúto put Hillary (Clinton) and her crew away for life,‚Äù NYPD sources said. TruePundit NYPD sources said Clinton‚Äôs ‚Äúcrew‚Äù also included several unnamed yet implicated members of Congress in addition to her aides and insiders. The NYPD seized the computer from Weiner during a search warrant and detectives discovered a trove of over 500,000 emails to and from Hillary Clinton, Abedin and other insiders during her tenure as secretary of state. The content of those emails sparked the FBI to reopen its defunct email investigation into Clinton on Friday. But new revelations on the contents of that laptop, according to law enforcement sources, implicate the Democratic presidential candidate, her subordinates, and even select elected officials in far more alleged serious crimes than mishandling classified and top secret emails, sources said. NYPD sources said these new emails include evidence linking Clinton herself and associates to: Money laundering Sex crimes with minors (children) Perjury Pay to play through Clinton Foundation Obstruction of justice Other felony crimes NYPD detectives and a NYPD Chief, the department‚Äôs highest rank under Commissioner, said openly that if the FBI and Justice Department fail to garner timely indictments against Clinton and co- conspirators, NYPD will go public with the damaging emails now in the hands of FBI Director James Comey and many FBI field offices. ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs in the emails is staggering and as a father, it turned my stomach,‚Äù the NYPD Chief said. ‚ÄúThere is not going to be any Houdini-like escape from what we found. We have copies of everything. We will ship them to Wikileaks or I will personally hold my own press conference if it comes to that.‚Äù The NYPD Chief said once Comey saw the alarming contents of the emails he was forced to reopen a criminal probe against Clinton. ‚ÄúPeople are going to prison,‚Äù he said. Meanwhile, FBI sources said Abedin and Weiner were cooperating with federal agents, who have taken over the non-sexting portions the case from NYPD. The husband-and-wife Clinton insiders are both shopping for separate immunity deals, sources said. ‚ÄúIf they don‚Äôt cooperate they are going to see long sentences,‚Äù a federal law enforcement source said. The new emails contain travel documents and itineraries indicating Hillary Clinton, President Bill Clinton, Weiner and multiple members of Congress and other government officials accompanied convicted pedophile billionaire Jeffrey Epstein on his Boeing 727 on multiple occasions to his private island in the U.S Virgin Islands, sources said. Epstein‚Äôs island has also been dubbed Orgy Island or Sex Slave Island where Epstein allegedly pimps out underage girls and boys to international dignitaries. Both NYPD and FBI sources confirm based on the new emails they now believe Hillary Clinton traveled as Epstein‚Äôs guest on at least six occasions, probably more when all the evidence is combed, sources said. Bill Clinton, it has been confirmed in media reports spanning recent years, that he too traveled with Epstein over 20 times to the island.

"‚ÄúWe are losing control of the streets,‚Äù say police as Angela Merkel‚Äôs Germany descends into chaos and lawlessness","BNI Store Nov 2 2016 ‚ÄúWe are losing control of the streets,‚Äù say police as Angela Merkel‚Äôs Germany descends into chaos and lawlessness GERMAN Chancellor Angela Merkel is facing catastrophe over her failed mass Muslim migration policy, according to a new report. Germany has been hit by a tidal wave of horrendous violent crime including rapes, sexual and physical assaults, stabbings, home invasions, robberies, burglaries and drug trafficking‚Ä¶not to mention Islamic terrorist attacks. UK Express Adding to the country‚Äôs woes is the fact that thousands of people have gone missing after travelling there on invitation from Anegla Merkel. Germany took in more than 1.1million migrants in the past year and parts of the country are crippled with a lack of infrastructure. Now the true reality is hitting home ahead of next year‚Äôs elections as the far right surges in the polls threatening to topple the Christian Democratic Union (CDU) leader Mrs Merkel. According to a report by the international policy council the Gatestone Institute, local police in many parts of the country admit that they are stretched to the limit. Despite the mayhem caused by skyrocketing violent crime and terror attacks by Muslim migrants, German officials insist on blaming the unrest on the rise of the ‚Äúfar right extremists‚Äù (aka German patriots). The report states: ‚ÄúThe rape of a ten-year-old girl in Leipzig, the largest city in Saxony, has drawn renewed attention to the spiralling levels of violent crime perpetrated by migrants in cities and towns across Germany. ‚ÄúThousands of migrants who entered the country as ‚Äòasylum seekers‚Äô or ‚Äòrefugees‚Äô have gone missing. They are, presumably, economic migrants who entered Germany on false pretences. ‚ÄúMany are thought to be engaging in robbery and criminal violence.‚Äù According to Freddi Lohse of the German Police Union in Hamburg, many migrant offenders view the leniency of the German justice system as a green light to continue delinquent behaviour, says the report. He said: ‚ÄúThey are used to tougher consequences in their home countries. ‚ÄúThey have no respect for us.‚Äù After the ‚Äúrefugee‚Äù disaster that Angela Merkel has created, she is now unsettled about Europe returning to nationalism. Nationalism is a nightmare for all the liberal leaders working for a New World Order. ‚ÄúDuring the first six months of 2016, Muslim migrants committed 142,500 crimes , according to the Federal Criminal Police Office. This is equivalent to 780 crimes committed by migrants every day, an increase of nearly 40 per cent over 2015. The data includes only those crimes in which a suspect has been caught. Muslim migrants committed 208,344 crimes in 2015 , according to a confidential police report leaked to Bild. This figure represents an 80 per cent increase since 2014 and is equivalent to 570 crimes committed by migrants every day, or 23 crimes each hour, in 2015 alone. ‚ÄúNearly 70 per cent of respondents said they fear for their lives and property in German train stations and subways, while 63 per cent feel unsafe at large public events.‚Äù The report added: ‚ÄúThe growing sense of lawlessness is substantiated by an October 24 YouGov poll which found that 68 per cent of Germans believe that security in the country has deteriorated during the past several years. Germans are taking to the streets in the thousands in weekly protests against the Muslim invasion started by the Obama/Soros/Clinton Arab Spring and aided and abetted by Angela Merkel. Meanwhile a female police officer has admitted that officers are under attack and that the courts are a ‚Äújoke.‚Äù In a new book, Tania Kambouri, a German police officer, said: ‚ÄúFor weeks, months and years I have noticed that Muslims, mostly young men, do not have even a minimum level of respect for the police. ‚ÄúWhen we are out patrolling the streets, we are verbally abused by young Muslims. ‚ÄúThere is the body language, and insults like ‚Äòs*** cop‚Äô when passing by. ‚ÄúIf we make a traffic stop, the aggression increases ever further, this is overwhelmingly the case with migrants. ‚ÄúIt cannot be that offenders continue to fill the police files, hurt us physically, insult us, whatever, and there are no consequences. ‚ÄúMany cases are closed or offenders are released on probation or whatever. ‚ÄúYes, what is happening in the courts today is a joke.‚Äù The construction of a small mosque, the first in the German state of Thuringia, created controversy after the Alternative for Germany party labeled it a ‚Äòland grab project‚Äô and announced a massive anti-Islam rally.",1

Metro Piotr Czak-Zukowski was found with an empty packet of bacon in his pocket when he was searched by police officers after the incident.

WHITE FLIGHT? Or is it white fright? British multiculturalism has created segregation in towns where the white population is fleeing as the Muslim population is exploding,"BNI Store Nov 2 2016 WHITE FLIGHT? Or is it white fright? British multiculturalism has created segregation in towns where the white population is fleeing as the Muslim population is exploding White and mainly Muslim minority groups are now more isolated from each other than ever before ‚Äì while white populations in towns and cities have sunk to record lows ‚Äì now less than 50% in the last decade alone, it has been revealed. UK Express In Newham, east London, just 16 per cent of the population are white compared to 33 per cent 10 years ago. And Blackburn has ranked as one of the most segregated town in Britain, where in the Whalley Range area 95 per cent of people are Muslim and a local butcher has admitted he has never served a white person in the whole of his time there. Mohammed Tabrez Noorji, who opened his halal butcher shop last year, said: ‚ÄúI do sometimes speak to the white people when they walk past but there is nothing for them to buy here. ‚ÄúIt is not good that we all live separately but how can we fix this problem? Muslim families like to live in the same area as each other so we can support one another, but then the white people move out. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not that we deliberately choose to live separately ‚Äì it is just what happens. We want to live in this area because we are close to the mosques and all our families are very close to each other.‚Äù And experts warn matters will increase in the same direction. Academic Ted Cantle, a Government advisor on community adhesion, has warned the 2021 census will reveal polarisation has got even greater. The research, published by Open Democracy, calls on the Government to do more to promote mixed communities. The calls have been made particularly relevant in light of the spike in hate crime reported since the Brexit referendum on June 23. But not everyone wants ‚Äòcommunity adhesion‚Äô to be encouraged. Retired taxi driver Ian Goodliffe, who previously worked at a ‚Äòwhite only‚Äô taxi firm, said: ‚ÄúThere are certain areas where white people no longer go and the same for Muslims. They lead very separate lives. ‚ÄúThere is an element of fear on both sides and then there is of course this awful racism. I hear it all the time. ‚ÄúIt is sometimes a gang mentality and everyone wants to stick to their own. There are whole parts of Blackburn where a white person would not buy a house but then there is the same for the Muslims. ‚ÄúThere is a mutual distrust and the only way to change that is for people to mix, but we are at a total impasse and it is only going to get worse.‚Äù Professor Cantle also said he met a Yorkshireman who said he was the first Muslim to move into a street and within three years all the white families had gone. He said: ‚Äú Some of those families made no bones about it ‚Äì they are moving out because ‚Äòthey‚Äô are moving in.‚Äù The study, conducted by integration experts Professor Cantle and Professor Eric Kaufman, has revealed that white and minority groups are now more isolated from each other than ever before ‚Äì even though England as a whole is more ethnically mixed. Polarization mainly occurs in urban areas, with some places in the UK seeing a decrease in the white population of more than 50 per cent between 1991 and 2011. Towns and cities, such as Birmingham, Leicester, Slough, Luton, Bradford and London have seen the ‚Äústriking‚Äù decrease occur more rapidly than other parts of the UK, it has been claimed. P rofessor Cantle said: ‚ÄúThe focus of policy needs to shift, this is not just about minorities. ‚ÄúPoliticians and policy-makers need to encourage white British residents to remain in diverse areas. ‚ÄúTo choose, rather than avoid, diverse areas when they do re-locate, encouraging similar choices with respect to placing pupils in diverse schools. ‚ÄúIn other words to create a positive choice for mixed areas and a shared society.‚Äù The study comes as the Government is about to deliver a major review into integration, segregation and extremism. Labour‚Äôs Chuka Umunna, chairman of the All Party Parliamentary Group on Social Integration, said: ‚ÄúDuring a year in which our country has seemed more divided than at any point in modern history, there are few questions which require investigation more urgently than the matter of how well we are living together. ‚ÄúEqually, however ‚Äì at a time in which our political debate has become yet more polarized and media headlines yet more fraught ‚Äì there are few questions which it can seem harder to get to the bottom of. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs clear that, whilst the UK is becoming increasingly diverse, levels of integration are not keeping pace.‚Äù",1

Illegal alien Muslim invaders have staged a mass protest in Paris over their treatment by French authorities following destruction of their makeshift camps. Masses of Muslim freeloaders sleeping in the streets joined local bleeding hearts to demonstrate at their encampment near the Stalingrad Metro station. UK Daily Mail (h/t therezam) One man held up a sign saying ‚Äòhuman, no beast‚Äô as a man used a loud speaker to lead the march, which happened late last night. It came 24 hours after violence broke out at the site with gangs of men attacking each other using sticks as makeshift clubs. The fighting unfolded just hours after demolition workers supported by riot police began smashing up an illegal camp full of UK-bound migrants in Paris. It also came in the wake of the destruction of the Calais Jungle which saw refugees transported around the country. It is not yet known what caused the fight in Paris. There had already been scuffles on Monday as mainly Afghans and Eritreans tried to save their possessions during the raid, which started soon after 8am. It followed thousands of Muslim freeloaders arriving in the French capital following the razing of the Calais Jungle refugee camp last week. While some 5000 Jungle residents agreed to be bused to resettlement centres around France, many others headed off independently, saying they still wanted to get to Britain. Up to 3000 set up tents on the pavements around the Stalingrad Metro station, which is close to the Gare du Nord Eurostar hub in the north of Paris. Shortly before Monday‚Äôs clearance French president Francois Hollande said: ‚ÄòWe won‚Äôt tolerate the camps any longer.‚Äô Referring to the Paris clearance, Mr Hollande said: ‚ÄòWe are going to carry out the same operation as in Calais.‚Äô CRS riot police around Stalingrad said there would be a ‚Äògradual operation‚Äô which is likely to go on all week until all the camps are gone.",1

Georgia State University professor Mia Bloom told The Times that studies show relatives and friends are aware of budding terrorist activities about 64% of the time and argued that Mateen‚Äôs abusive relationship with Salman ‚Äúdoesn‚Äôt give her a free pass as a bystander to not come forward.‚Äù Salman insists she had no dark suspicions about several trips she took with Mateen that have been viewed as preparation for his terrorist career, although the lawyers notably intervened to prevent her from discussing the most notorious of these incidents ‚Äì the April 2015 trip to Disneyworld that Mateen may have used to case the park for an attack. Salman did nothing to warn the police of her husband‚Äôs intentions. When the FBI first questioned Salman, she admitted to bringing Mateen ammunition and a holster. The piece describes her as ‚Äúshattered and afraid,‚Äù to the point that she sometimes has trouble getting out of bed. (Awww‚Ä¶I bet those 49 people her husband slaughtered in cold blood in Orlando would love to have that problem)",1

HILLARY CLINTON is being funded by the same Muslim terrorism supporting governments as the Islamic State (ISIS),"November 4, 2016 @ 4:48 pm 
Now why am I not surprised? Countries which have allowed enough undesirable‚Äôs to immigrate, have been sucked in with the undesirables network of serious organised crime. Crime‚Äôs are largely committed upon non believers, as is the right these people have been bought up to believe they have. They are bought up to lie and cheat. It is human nature for pretty much everyone ‚Äì is to have material things better than they would normally afford. Be it a nicer home, or some annual holiday or expensive motor car. Who does not like the better things in life? Well ‚Äì these scheming thieves already have a network of bribed politicians, EU, law officials, high paid company executives etc ‚Äì in their pockets. All from a share of the corrupt money they have stolen from Western Societies. And distributed a cut to money greedy people who are trusted in running our companies, States and Countries. With what I see going on with the likes of the EU ‚Äì I am not surprised one bit with likely outcomes with the Clinton foundation. Oh ‚Äì they come out with statements that they are fighting terrorism, yet they have been bribed to do as they are told ‚Äì and actually let these undesirables help themselves to our money. And these undesirables funnel plenty of money to the very people our in power politicians pretend they are protecting us from. It is very much a catch 22 situation. They spend lots of money to fight ISIS, yet on the hand allow these people to help themselves to our purse ‚Äì effectively supporting them. All due to our human nature of wanting more than our honest fair share. Our financial world is can of worms. Let‚Äôs hope a nasty world war is held off for as long as possible ‚Äì as this is where we are heading ‚Äì for whoever ends up in power. In the mean time ‚Äì our people in power are turning our free Western societies into mini mayhems ‚Äì and pretending they are doing good. All for MONEY.",1
BELGIUM: Leftist bleeding heart activists whine about Muslims being targeted in counter-terrorism crackdown,"BELGIUM: Leftist bleeding heart activists whine about Muslims being targeted in counter-terrorism crackdown MOLENBEEK: Belgium‚Äôs hotbed of violent Islamic jihad where up to 80% of the population is Muslim and ISIS terrorists are considered heroes, Muslims being questioned by police complain of being ‚Äúinsulted and humiliated,‚Äù says Human Rights Watch, who accuse police of overly harsh treatment of terrorist suspects. Belgium, with a population of just 11million and about a half million Muslims ‚Äì has produced more jihadi fighters per capita than any other country in Europe. Molenbeek-Saint-Jean ‚Äì home to just 90,000 habitants ‚Äì has become known across the world as Europe‚Äôs ‚Äújihadi conveyor belt‚Äù.

The one-finger salute of ISIS in Molenbeek In response the Belgian government has enacted a raft of new counterterrorism laws and regulations, and deployed more than 1,800 soldiers in major cities. The Belgian police have carried out several hundred raids, detentions and stops and searches, many in Molenbeek, the neighborhood of Brussels that was a home or way station to many of the Paris and Brussels attackers. These actions have helped the authorities convict 43 suspects and charge 72 others for terrorism-related crimes.

"‚ÄúMODERATE‚Äù INDONESIA: Protest against a Christian governor turns violent as more than 100,000 Muslims demand death for Christian governor who ‚Äúblasphemed‚Äù Islam","BNI Store Nov 4 2016 ‚ÄúMODERATE‚Äù INDONESIA: Protest against a Christian governor turns violent as more than 100,000 Muslims demand death for Christian governor who ‚Äúblasphemed‚Äù Islam JARKARTA: The biggest street protest in years shook this sprawling capital today in a stark display of the more conservative, militant strain of Islam taking hold in the world‚Äôs largest Muslim country. ( Which Hillary Clinton has called a ‚Äúshining example of a ‚Äòmoderate‚Äô Islamic country‚Äù ) WSJ Police said an estimated 100,000 people turned out for a rally called by hard-line Muslim groups against the capital‚Äôs Christian governor, whom they accuse of having committed blasphemy. Blasphemy is a criminal offense in Indonesia and prosecutions have increased in the past decade. President Joko Widodo had met with other political leaders amid calls for calm, but critics say he has been too slow since taking office in 2014 to respond to worsening tension for fear of being labeled anti-Muslim. ‚ÄúReligiosity is rising, especially among the middle class,‚Äù said Yon Machmudi, an Islamic politics expert at the University of Indonesia. ‚ÄúA sense of identification is increasing.‚Äô‚Äô Protesters were taking aim at Basuki Tjahaha Purnama, known as Ahok, who is the most prominent politician among the country‚Äôs often-persecuted, ethnic Chinese minority. He was elected deputy governor in 2012 and elevated to the top job in 2014 after his boss, Mr. Widodo, was elected president. Some hard-liners had tried to block his ascent then, saying Muslims shouldn‚Äôt be ruled by a ‚Äúkafir,‚Äù or nonbeliever. Mr. Purnama, now running for re-election, angered the groups again by citing a verse of the Quran in a public address in late September. He has apologized and said he would cooperate with a police investigation, but has since been the target of protests. Vice President Jusuf Kalla met a group of protest leaders and said afterward that police would pursue a blasphemy case against Mr. Purnama. Nearly 90% of Indonesia‚Äôs 250 million people are Muslim and are becoming more radical every year as seen by head scarves for women, once rare, are now widely worn and Islamic schools are expanding. A movement to ban alcohol is gaining steam and sales have been banned from convenience stores. Travel to Mecca for the minor pilgrimage of umrah, once a relatively uncommon undertaking for middle-class Indonesians, is newly popular. Security experts say the rising conservatism paves the way for potential violence , pointing to some religious hard-liners who have rebranded themselves as cells of Islamic State. ‚ÄúWhat we‚Äôve seen in the last 18 months to two years is increasing crossover from organizations that started out ‚Äònonviolent but hard-line‚Äô to organizations which are now committed to using violence,‚Äù said Sidney Jones, director of the Jakarta-based Institute for Policy Analysis of Conflict.

UK Telegraph Cardinal Vincent Nichols said immigrants had been enduring a worsening ‚Äúatmosphere of fear‚Äù in the months since the EU referendum with the members of the public casually voicing hatred in a ‚Äúself-indulgent‚Äù way. (Self-indulgent? I wonder what this French priest would have to say about that?)

In an interview with the BBC , he insisted that increasingly secular British society could learn much from the faith of new arrivals whether Muslims or followers of other religions. ‚ÄúOf course what we have to learn too is from the vibrancy of the Muslim faith that comes here. H e added: ‚ÄúI think the immigration crisis is real and it needs concerted effort to address it,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúIt needs to be addressed realistically with resources and proper legislation, but it‚Äôs almost impossible to do that in an atmosphere in which fear and hatred are the dominant features. ‚ÄúIt does nobody any good, this somewhat self-indulgent way in which people have begun to express themselves and their distaste and their hatred of people who they see as different. ‚ÄúAnd that is creating a culture of fear among people who have been welcomed here.‚Äù",1

Because rightly or wrongly, people project their view of the world onto others.We live according to the golden rule and don‚Äôt do to others that which we do not want them to.do to us. Many cannot fathom or conceive just how vile the followers of the murderous paedophile can be. It‚Äôs incomprehensible. Even animals that have been traumatised and abused don‚Äôt behave like that when rescued. Europeans have mostly been peaceful for the last 70 years because they made a concerted effort to live in peace and to uphold dignity of life and human rights. That came at a price. Followers of the paedophile savage are socialised differently. They are pathetic and emotionally infantile. In the West we are taught to take personal responsibility for our actions. They are taught to blame everyone but themselves often turning victims into the guilty in the case of raped women. In the West violent displays of anger are frowned upon and we are taught to apologise for our wrong doIngs. Muslims have a warped and messed up sense of honour. An honour they will gladly kill their families to restore. In short they accept everything that is a crime in our countries as somehow permissible. Incompatible. In the West they are given human rights they don‚Äôt deserve and freedoms they can‚Äôt handle. Proven recipe for disaster. You have to be very very naive to believe that people who are fed a steady diet of intolerance, opression and hatred since birth will miraculously change just because they cross a border from hell hole to civilsed country. It should be obvious by now that Muslims born in europe cannot be integrated so what hope do we have integrating the rest. Nicolai sennels wrote a great paper on why islam is prone to creating monsters. Puts it all into perspective and is a must read in my opinion.",1

Paul LePage is withdrawing the state of Maine from the federal refugee settlement program, citing a loss of confidence in its ability to safely and responsibly run the program. Maine has become one of the Obama Regime‚Äôs favorite dumping grounds for unskilled, illiterate, welfare-dependant large Somali Muslim families. Obama doesn‚Äôt need a religious test for refugees because most of them are Muslims WCSH6 (h/t kafir) In a letter Friday, Gov. LePage informed President Obama and notified the director of the Office of Refugee Resettlement (ORR) that Maine would no longer be participating in the program. ‚ÄúThe federal government has proven to be an unwilling partner with states in ensuring that refugee settlement does not unduly put American lives at risk,‚Äù LePage wrote. Maine joins Kansas, New Jersey and Texas in severing ties with the ORR. In the letter, LePage included the case of refugee Adnan Fazeli of Freeport, who was revealed in August through an FBI investigation to have died last year while fighting for the Islamic State. ‚ÄúI sincerely hope that the federal government will re-evaluate its current refugee policy ‚Äî both the quantity and nation of origin of refugees it resettles and the vetting process they are subjected in ‚Äî in order to best protect the safety and interests of the American people,‚Äù LePage wrote. The typical size of Somali Muslim refugee families places an unfair burden on hardworking American taxpayers who must fund welfare for them According to LePage‚Äôs office, the governor has directed the state Health and Human Services Department (DHHS) to work with federal counterparts to implement a transition out of the ORR program. The ORR was created after the passing of the 1980 Refugee Act, which provided the legal basis. By withdrawing from the federal program, LePage has removed state workers from the integration assistance process but has not stopped refugees from entering or living in Maine.",1

TRUMP CAMPAIGN being sued for humiliating Skittles candy by comparing it to Syrian Muslim infiltrators,"TRUMP CAMPAIGN being sued for humiliating Skittles candy by comparing it to Syrian Muslim infiltrators It was a campaign ad that ignited a firestorm: Donald Trump Jr. tweeted a photo of a bowl of skittles and compared the colorful candy to Syrian jihadists posing as refugees. Now, the man who took the photo is suing Donald Trump, Donald Trump Jr., and vice-presidential nominee Mike Pence for copyright infringement. Liberals accused the tweet of being insenstive, racist, and a micro-agression which forced them to seek shelter in the nearest safe room. CBC David Kittos, an expert photographer and former Cypriot refugee, says he never gave permission and never would give permission for his photo to be used in the ad. ‚ÄúThe image, the way it was used is reprehensible,‚Äù said Kittos from his home in Surrey, England, in an interview with CBC News. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs ignoring the plight of the refugees and it‚Äôs completely unacceptable that someone who was born into privilege would steal my picture and use it to make this political point.‚Äù Kittos says when he first saw the tweet, he was ‚Äúin shock.‚Äù He explains he took the photo in 2010 as an experiment using artificial lighting and posted it on Flickr . ‚ÄúI just couldn‚Äôt believe my humble picture of some Skittles would just be used by someone so powerful.‚Äù Kittos says his lawyer reached out to the Trump campaign to discuss the matter but got no response. So he reported a copyright violation to Twitter, and about a week after it was posted his Skittles photo was removed from Trump Jr.‚Äôs tweet. Even though his photo is no longer connected to the ad, Kittos decided to file a lawsuit at a federal court in Illinois. He says he wants to ensure the Trump campaign never uses the work again. As well, he wants to spread the message that ‚Äúthey can‚Äôt go around stealing from authors like myself. They‚Äôre not above the law.‚Äù The Trump campaign told CBC News it‚Äôs not commenting on the case at this time. Back in September, Trump Jr. defended the tweet. ‚ÄúI am surprised by the reaction simply because it is a metaphor for risk,‚Äù he said at a campaign stop in Boise, Idaho. Trump‚Äôs election campaign has called for ‚Äúextreme vetting‚Äù of immigrants to the U.S., especially Muslims, to help weed out anyone who could be a danger to American citizens. While Trump‚Äôs position is popular with some Americans, his eldest son‚Äôs tweet ignited outrage on social media. ‚ÄúSorry kid. For all we know you could be a poisonous Skittle,‚Äù someone tweeted along with a well-known photo of an injured and bloodied young Syrian boy. ‚ÄúThe stupidity ensues,‚Äù commented another person. Even the Skittles owner, Mars, Inc., weighed in. ‚ÄúSkittles are candy. Refugees are people,‚Äù tweeted Denise Young, vice-president of corporate affairs. Kittos is seeking yet to be determined damages as part of the lawsuit. But he says he‚Äôs not in it for the money (sure he isn‚Äôt) and would have settled a for a public apology. Because that didn‚Äôt happen, he says he‚Äôs pursuing the lawsuit because ‚Äúit‚Äôs the right thing to do.‚Äù",1

At the newly sharia-compliant University of Southern Maine, moronic school officials say ‚ÄúDeus Vult‚Äù Graffiti of Crusades‚Äô rallying cry is being referred to the state Attorney General‚Äôs office after the Latin phrase used by Christians was written on a desk and wall in a student government office. Press Herald The phrase was used as a rallying cry for Christians during the Crusades in medieval times, and more recently has now is being called an anti-Muslim insult. In an email to the campus community, USM President Glenn Cummings condemned the ‚Äúanti-Muslim graffiti‚Äù found in the office in the Woodbury Campus Center. ‚ÄúI want you to know that addressing this is our highest priority. Our campus security is fully investigating what we believe to be a hate crime,‚Äù Cummings wrote. ‚ÄúA team from our Dean of Students is working hard to uncover the facts while providing opportunities for intergroup dialogue and supporting students directly and indirectly affected by this reprehensible act.

Khan, who declined to identify the student because of the investigation, said the two witnesses have said they didn‚Äôt understand the meaning of the phrase ‚Äì which was written in small letters on an electrical wire cover on a wall, and on a wooden desk. USM officials also have not released the student‚Äôs name. In a Facebook post, USM student body Vice President Matt Raymond condemned the graffiti. ‚ÄúI just wanted to say that all this happened a day after five Muslim students asked for applications to Student Government to become Senators. I believe this act of ‚Äúcriminal intimidation‚Äù (Seriously? You should be taken away in a straitjacket) to be linked to that fact,‚Äù Raymond wrote, adding that student government is open to all students of any race, gender, religion, sexuality, economic background or nationality.‚Äù (It is, but you can‚Äôt blame students for hating Muslims, the biggest threat to America) Southwest Airlines knows what it means and acted accordingly Humza Khan, myself, and our Cabinet under the Executive branch condemn in the harshest terms this crime of bias and intimidation. Let‚Äôs show folks that USM is a diverse and inclusive university for all moving forward!‚Äù A group of about 40 students rallied in support of Muslim students at lunchtime Thursday. Raymond said he plans to ask the student Senate to vote out two members who he believes did not respond appropriately to the incident. Khan said he believes the person who wrote the graffiti intended to intimidate Muslim students who have expressed interest in joining the student Senate. ‚ÄúThe way Muslims see (that Latin phrase,) we see it indirectly as ‚ÄòLet‚Äôs kill Muslims,‚Äô ‚Äù said Khan, who is Muslim. (But Muslim students who keep saying Death to Israel/Death to America are said to be exercising their freedom of speech) ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not immediately seen as racist, it‚Äôs not a racial epithet, but it‚Äôs still there to intimidate a specific group of people,‚Äù Raymond said. ‚ÄúAnd it served its purpose, even though it was coded language.‚Äù (One can only hope.

ALL IN‚Ä¶IN THE HOOD‚Ä¶for Donald Trump!,"ALL IN‚Ä¶IN THE HOOD‚Ä¶for Donald Trump! Donald Trump is on track to win more of the African-American vote than any other Republican in modern memory, said John Yob, CEO of a Michigan-based polling firm, Strategic National . And that‚Äôs why Barack Hussein Obama is running around campaigning so hard against him for Hillary. While that so-called ‚Äúracist‚Äù Donald Trump along with Rosa Parks and Muhammad Ali, were receiving the Ellis Island Medal of Honor from the National Ethnic Coalition Organization‚Ä¶ ‚Ä¶Hillary Clinton was singing the praises of Democrat Senator Robert Byrd, former leader in the Ku Klux Klan before becoming a U.S. Senator. Breitbart On Friday, a poll of 506 Pennsylvania voters by Harper Polling showed Trump has the support of 18.46 percent of African-Americans. An Oct. 30 poll of 1,249 likely voters in Pennsylvania showed Trump has 19 percent support among African Americans, while another 7 percent remain undecided. That poll has a error margin of 2.77 percent. In next-door Michigan, two nights of a tracking poll conducted for Fox 2 of 1,150 likely voters showed Trump with 14 percent support and 19 percent support. That‚Äôs equivalent to a two-point shift from Clinton to Trump in the state. Trump is gaining in Michigan partly because many African-American voters ‚Äî especially younger voters who backed Sen. Bernie Saunders ‚Äî distrust Clinton, said W ayne Bradley, state director of African-American engagement for the Michigan Republican Party. That distrust has helped cause a sharp drop in the number of absentee ballots mailed in from Detroit, even as other part of the state send in more ballots that before, Bradley said. Faced with a low turnout, the Clinton campaign is trying to frighten African-Americans to vote, but ‚Äút hat‚Äôs not a convincing enough argument,‚Äù he said. Trump‚Äôs gain among African-American voters is happening in many states, alongside an overall reduction in African-American enthusiasm and support for Obama‚Äôs designated successor. That drop-off in support from Obama‚Äôs 93 percent level will likely reduce the turnout for Clinton. That‚Äôs a problem for Democrats, because a 7.5 percent drop in nationwide African-American turnout would be equal to a one-point drop in a nationwide vote for Clinton. Reports say the early-voting turnout by Africans Americans has dropped by up to 10 percent in North Carolina and by somewhat less in Florida . President Barack Obama and other top Democrats have hopscotched through the states to push that turnout back up by election day. But pollsters face problems when trying to gauge opinions in a high-stakes emotional competition. Some concerned people lie to pollsters. For example, roughly 7 percent of college grads hide their support for Trump when they‚Äôre ask by pollsters over the phone, perhaps out of fear of penalties if their choice was made public. So when polls show a non-answer from respondents, for example, many undecided voters, the votes may be hiding a weak or strong preference for Trump. These factor may be impacting polls of African-Americans, who are being hammered by claims from Clinton and Obama that Trump is supposedly a racist. ‚ÄúIf you accept the support of Klan sympathizers ‚Äî the Klan ‚Äî and hesitate when asked about that support, then you‚Äôll tolerate that support when you‚Äôre in office,‚Äù Obama told an African-American crowd in North Carolina on Nov. 3. (See above for Hillary‚Äôs support of the KKK) A national poll by TIPP showed Clinton at only 75 percent support among all non-whites, including Hispanics, African-Americans and Latinos. That poll showed Trump getting support from 15 percent of non-whites , leaving 5 percent undecided and 5 percent supporting other candidates. Amid the disagreement, rivalries and complexity, Bradley is confident that Trump will do well among African-Americans. His final tally as the GOP candidate ‚Äúwill be a higher number that it has been in the past‚Ä¶ [because] he‚Äôs working, he‚Äôs coming to these cities to deliver the message.‚Äù The African-American vote may even be enough to help push Trump over the so-called ‚Äúblue wall‚Äù of Democratic northern states that stands in his path to the White House. Some say Trump is likely to get 16-25% of Black vote.",1
MINNESOTASTAN: Tagging the Muslim Student Association (MSA) sign with ‚ÄúISIS‚Äù is NOT a hate crime but an accurate description of what the MSA stands for,"BNI Store Nov 5 2016 MINNESOTASTAN: Tagging the Muslim Student Association (MSA) sign with ‚ÄúISIS‚Äù is NOT a hate crime but an accurate description of what the MSA stands for The discovery of ISIS graffiti on the MSA sign at the University of Minnesota campus has the local chapter of designated terrorist group CAIR (Council on American-Islamic Relations) calling for a hate crime investigation. CAIR-MN says that ‚ÄúIslamophobic‚Äù vandals spray-painted ‚ÄúISIS‚Äù on the Muslim Student Association‚Äôs sign on campus. However, if you are familiar with the background of the MSA, it‚Äôs easy to understand why ISIS is an appropriate tag for them.

FOX9 Naturally, the CAIR thugs think you are too ignorant to know this, so they perform their usual ‚ÄúIslamophobia‚Äù tap dance, demanding yet another time-wasting state and local hate crime investigation for some harmless graffiti which was likely painted by Muslim students themselves. ‚ÄúUniversity administrators and state religious and political leaders must speak out forcefully against the rising anti-Muslim hate in our society that results in such disturbing incidents,‚Äù said a statement from CAIR-MN executive director Jaylani Hussein. ‚ÄúWe urge campus police and other relevant law enforcement agencies to investigate this incident as a hate crime.‚Äù Hussein cited the ‚ÄúIslamophobic rhetoric in the presidential election campaign,‚Äù particularly from Donald Trump, as a possible contributing factor to these types of incidents.

"GERMANY: Bigger than the Berlin Wall, the 12-foot-high ‚ÄòMunich Wall‚Äô is being constructed to protect local residents from illegal alien Muslim invaders","BNI Store Nov 6 2016 GERMANY: Bigger than the Berlin Wall, the 12-foot-high ‚ÄòMunich Wall‚Äô is being constructed to protect local residents from illegal alien Muslim invaders Locals campaigned for the wall, in the suburb of Neuperlach S√ºd, after authorities decided that some 160 young (up to age 40) unaccompanied Muslim illegals will move into a large shelter which is less than 100 metres from a residential estate. UK Daily Mail Critics say the wall is further proof of the alienation voters feel with Chancellor Angela Merkel‚Äôs refugee policy. Deputy District Chairman Guido Bucholtz, said: ‚ÄòI was frightened when I saw this monster of a wall.‚Äô (Not as frightened as Germans are of the Muslim invaders) He added that he thinks the wall is too high as another similar structure designed to fence off a migrant camp was just three metres high. He said: ‚ÄòThis whole propaganda really sucks.‚Äô (Yeah, I guess you don‚Äôt like it when people find out you‚Äôve been lying to them) However residents from the neighbouring housing development from the asylum centre went to court to get the wall built. One of their arguments for the wall was the fear that the value of their homes would plummet if there was nothing to separate them from the refugees who could be there for years to come. Local residents said they are fearful of the ‚Äònoise and behaviour‚Äô of the Muslim thugs. The judge of the Administrative Court in Munich confirmed the wall in a judgment ‚Äì noted that the migrants should not use if for ‚Äòball throwing games‚Äô or other ‚Äòleisure use‚Äô. The fact that it is higher than the Berlin Wall of the Cold War is not lost on locals and officials. But engineers said it had to be that high to provide an effective sound insulation. The wall is nearly finished.

GERMAN INTERIOR MINISTER demands that Italy send all new illegal alien Muslim invaders back to Africa,"GERMAN INTERIOR MINISTER demands that Italy send all new illegal alien Muslim invaders back to Africa Germany‚Äôs Minister of the Interior has launched a controversial proposal to return African Muslim male invaders home rather than bringing them to Italy, in order to discourage more economic freeloaders from attempting the dangerous crossing. Even worse, Italy has been rescuing them near Libya, not even waiting until they get within spitting distance of Italy. So, where are all the women and children? @moas_eu the taxi service just outside of Libya is part of the pull factor 
‚Äî The Champ (@audioexpression) November 5, 2016 Breitbart Minister Thomas de Maizi√®re said Sunday that those ‚Äúsaved in the Mediterranean should be sent back to Africa‚Äù instead of taking them to Europe. According to a spokeswoman for the minister, this measure would serve a twofold purpose: discouraging new migrants from coming while also demolishing the organizations of human traffickers that organize the crossings. Germany‚Äôs interior minister Thomas de Maiziere threatened to close Italy‚Äôs border with Austria if Rome starts sending migrants north. With the migrant route through the Balkans from Greece closed, migrants are instead crossing the Mediterranean from North African countries such as Libya and arriving in Italy. De Maizi√®re is not alone in his approach. ‚ÄúThe prevention of illegal migration does not start at our internal borders,‚Äù said Helmut Teichmann, director of the Germany‚Äôs Federal Police. ‚ÄúThe aim of the federal government is to stop the refugees before they reach Europe,‚Äù he said. On Saturday, 2,200 more people tried to cross the Strait of Sicily in 16 different vessels, and were rescued in a series of operations coordinated by the Italian Coast Guard who later brought them to Italy. Rescuers also recovered ten bodies of migrants who drowned during the attempt. Critics were quick to remark that part of the incentive for attempting the crossing in the first place is the knowledge that migrant rescuers are providing a free ‚Äútaxi service‚Äù to Italy. Protesters have raised their voices in opposition to De Maizi√®re‚Äôs plan, claiming it was a ‚Äúscandal‚Äù that would effectively deny potential refugees the right of asylum, but the Minister did not back down. ‚ÄúEliminating the prospect of reaching Europe could keep them from risking their lives in a dangerous journey.‚Äù In point of fact, this year has seen the deaths of a record number of migrants during the perilous trip. On Thursday, some 240 migrants drowned in two shipwrecks off the coast of Libya, bringing the year‚Äôs death toll in the Mediterranean to 4,220, compared with 3,777 in the whole of 2015. The Minister suggested that once the migrants were returned to Tunisia, Egypt or other North African countries, they could submit their asylum applications which, if approved, would allow them to reach Europe safely. 
As of 2 November, 159,496 people had reached Italy by sea so far in 2016, according to the International Organization of Migrants (IOM).",1

Talking to supporters, Strache argued ‚Äúthe uncontrolled influx of migrants alien to our culture who seep into our social welfare system‚Ä¶ makes civil war in the medium-term not unlikely.‚Äù Austrian Freedom Party (FPOe) party leader Heinz-Christian Strache (L) and Freedom Party‚Äôs presidential candidate Norbert Hofer UK Express (h/t Terry D) Strache added that his party‚Äôs presidential candidate, Norbert Hofer, ‚Äúwill be there for all Austrians‚Äù in a rallying speech to drum up support ahead of the general election. Hofer has attempted to keep a neutral tone in a bid to broaden the typical appeal of the Freedom Party from an anti-immigration stance to the wider Austrian population ahead of a re-run of the earlier election. Yet the 45-year-old‚Äôs recent election posters carry the phrase ‚Äúso help me God‚Äù ‚Äì a term which has been slammed by both Islamic and Christian officials who say introducing God into the campaign is not appropriate. ‚ÄúVienna must not become Istanbul‚Äù He says what Vienna thinks Three branches of the Protestant church in Austria released a joint statement denouncing the slogan.

Two-thirds of Austrians identify as Catholic while just four per cent are Protestant. The Freedom Party narrowly lost the election by just 31,000 votes to Alexander Van der Bellen‚Äôs left-leaning Green party, but the result was ruled void after voting irregularities were discovered.

UK: Muslim family who converted to Christianity forced to flee Manningham home as violence and threats by Muslims against them continue to escalate,"BNI Store Nov 6 2016 UK: Muslim family who converted to Christianity forced to flee Manningham home as violence and threats by Muslims against them continue to escalate A British Christian convert who said he suffered ‚Äúseven years of persecution‚Äù from Muslims has been forced to flee his home under armed guard amid fears for his safety. Nissar Hussain was with his family when police arrived and moved him to a safe place. The Telegraph and Argus Mr Hussain said the culmination of the ‚Äúextreme persecution‚Äù had devastated his family and the dramatic arrival of armed police was a complete surprise. ‚ÄúMy family are distraught and extremely traumatised to be leaving,‚Äù said Mr Hussain. ‚ÄúBut when your life is at stake there is no other choice.‚Äù Mr Hussain converted to Christianity 20 years ago, but says in recent years he has been subjected to harassment and violence by sections of the Islamic community. ‚ÄúThis extreme persecution by certain people in the Muslim community because we are converts has broken us as a family,‚Äù he said. From left to right, Leena, Anniesa, Nissar, Sarah, Kubra, Issar, and Miriam Hussain, a Christian family who have been threatened with death for converting from Islam in West Yorkshire, England. ‚ÄúWe are fragmented and I do not know how we will recover from this. We haven‚Äôt functioned properly for years.‚Äù He said ‚Äúserious questions‚Äù needed to be answered. Last year, Mr Hussain was hospitalized after his kneecap was smashed and his hand broken during an attack outside his home in St Paul‚Äôs Road, Manningham . Two hooded men, one armed with a pick-axe handle, assaulted him in a vicious attack caught on CCTV. (See video below) At the time, Mr Hussain said he and his family were being driven out of the city and he was making plans to leave. This week he had started packing up his belongings when the police arrived on Thursday. The 50-year-old, who was a nurse before leaving work due to post-traumatic stress disorder, said his six children, aged eight to 24, and wife would never see their friends again. Nissar Hussain, 49, was hospitalised on 17 November 2015 with a smashed kneecap and broken arm after a violent attack which was captured on CCTV. He said he was attacked because he converted from Islam to Christianity and that his troubles started after he appeared on a Channel 4 documentary on how Islam converts are treated. He had been expecting an attack for some months, but when the police arrived he was ‚Äúnone the wiser‚Äù that he was at such serious risk. ‚ÄúThe armed police arrived at about 3pm on Thursday,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúI had been loading a van up with our belongings for eight hours, having to stealthily check no-one could see what I was doing, before they arrived. Hussein stands in front of his car that was vandalized by Muslims ‚ÄúIt took me completely by surprise, but their [the police] professionalism was deeply reassuring, and they escorted my family and I to a safe haven outside Yorkshire.‚Äù Last night, a West Yorkshire Police spokesman said ‚ÄúOur priority has always been to work effectively with our partners to minimise the risk to Mr Hussain and ensure that we maximise opportunities to put control measures in place to safeguard him, his family and consider any wider impact upon the communities across West Yorkshire,‚Äù he added. Neighbors demand justice for the persecuted Hussein family ‚ÄúWe are disappointed that Mr Hussain and his family have decided to leave Bradford, particularly as police and partners have been working together for some time to try and resolve the situation to the benefit of all parties concerned. ‚ÄúAll the incidents reported by Mr Hussain have been recorded in line with National guidance and we continue to proactively pursue lines of enquiry to identify the perpetrators and are committed to ensuring that a thorough and effective investigation is undertaken to mitigate the threat posed in the first instance and where possible bring the perpetrators to justice.",1
HERE THEY GO AGAIN! Muslims trying to claim that the Hebrew-language Dead Sea Scrolls are Arab Muslim in origin,"BNI Store Nov 7 2016 HERE THEY GO AGAIN! Muslims trying to claim that the Hebrew-language Dead Sea Scrolls are Arab Muslim in origin So, let me get this straight. The Dead Sea Scrolls are demonstrably written in Hebrew. But the Palestinians are now saying these ancient documents are, like Jerusalem‚Äôs Temple Mount , the holiest site in Judaism, Arab Muslim in origin.That is how ridiculous the campaign to delegitimize Israel has become. Israel Today Carmel Shama-Hacohen ‚Äì Israel‚Äôs ambassador to the United Nations Education, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) ‚Äì said the Palestinians raised the matter informally during a recent meeting of the Intergovernmental Committee for Promoting the Return of Cultural Property to its Countries of Origin. JERUSALEM POST The dead Sea Scrolls are about 900 documents and Biblical texts, discovered in one of the greatest archaeological finds of the 20th century in the 1940‚Äôs and 50‚Äôs in caves in and around Qumran on the northwest shore of the Dead Sea. The texts include some of the only known surviving copies of Biblical documents made before 100 B.C.E., and preserve evidence of Jewish life during the Second Temple period. According to the ambassador and to representatives of the Israel Antiquities Authority who were present at the meeting, the Palestinians intend to make a formal claim to the Dead Sea Scrolls when the committee next convenes in 2017. ‚ÄúThis is another provocative and audacious attempt by the Palestinians to rewrite history and to erase our connection to our land,‚Äù Shama-Hacohen told The Jerusalem Post . ‚ÄúThe Dead Sea Scrolls are factual and weighty archeological evidence of the presence of the Jewish people in the Land of Israel.‚Äù ‚Äú[The accusation is] part of an ongoing effort to deny the continuous Jewish presence in Israel. The Dead Sea Scrolls provide incontrovertible proof of the historical facts that underpin the legitimacy of Israel as a Jewish state,‚Äù David Koschitzky, chairman of the UJA Federation in Toronto. ‚ÄúAs such, they pose a threat to the ongoing attempts to obscure the unique relationship of the Jewish people with the land of Israel.",1

BIGGEST MUSLIM LIE OF THE DAY: ‚ÄúWhite supremacists are openly threatening Election Day violence‚Ä¶so the FBI is hassling Muslims‚Äù,"BNI Store Nov 7 2016 BIGGEST MUSLIM LIE OF THE DAY: ‚ÄúWhite supremacists are openly threatening Election Day violence‚Ä¶so the FBI is hassling Muslims‚Äù Is it the inbreeding? Or just that they think they can promote any fantastical lie or obfuscation and the Kardashian-worshipping American public won‚Äôt notice. It‚Äôs been reported for days that The Islamic State/al-Qaeda is calling for the ‚Äúslaughter of U.S. voters‚Äù on Election Day. But that didn‚Äôt stop officials from designated terrorist group CAIR from inventing a fake potential threat against Muslims‚Ä¶to deflect the fact that the FBI is questioning potential terror-linked suspects in the Muslim community. USA Today Ritz Katz, director of the SITE Intelligence Group, said Saturday on Twitter that the threats appear in an essay carried by the Islamic State‚Äôs Al Hayat media center that declares militants ‚Äúhave come to slaughter you and smash your ballot boxes.‚Äù 3) #ISIS urges Muslims to refuse participate in #Elections2016 & to announce that they ‚Äúhave come to slaughter you & smash your ballot boxes‚Äù 
‚Äî Rita Katz (@Rita_Katz) November 5, 2016 ‚ÄúMay Allah make this year‚Äôs U.S. presidential election a dreadful calamity like no other to have struck America throughout its pathetic history,‚Äù the seven-page manifesto, entitled ‚ÄúThe Murtadd Vote ,‚Äù read. Murtadd is an apostate who turns his back on Islam. The essay, which uses lengthy religious arguments in an effort to justify such attacks, also declares there is no difference between the Republican and Democratic parties in their ‚Äúpolicies against Islam and Muslims‚Äù In an article from the perpetually Muslim-sympathizing Fusion website: As if Muslim Americans haven‚Äôt had it hard enough during this presidential campaign‚Äîwhat with Donald Trump‚Äôs steady drumbeat of Islamophobic racism‚Äìnow comes reports that federal agents are paying surprise visits to Muslims across the United States ahead of the November 8 election. According to officials from the Council on American Islamic Relations, representatives from the FBI have questioned Muslims living in at least eight states leading up to November 8, reportedly searching for information pertaining to a possible Election Day al Qaeda threat . Over the weekend, the designated terrorist group CAIR (Council on American Islamic Relations) received reports from Muslim-Americans in eight states, who said they were approached by FBI agents who wanted to speak to them about the alleged threat. Those states included California, Washington State, Michigan, Pennsylvania, Kansas Oklahoma, Florida and Texas. Hassan Shibly, executive director of CAIR‚Äôs Florida offices, called the reported questioning ‚Äúcompletely outrageous,‚Äù and ‚Äúborderline unconstitutional,‚Äù telling the Washington Post : ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs the equivalent of the FBI visiting churchgoing Christians because someone overseas was threatening to blow up an abortion clinic. It‚Äôs that preposterous and outrageous.‚Äù The people who were interviewed this weekend were asked if they knew anyone who might want to harm Americans at home or abroad. Shibly said all of those interviewed appeared to be of Afghani or Pakistani descent. Shibly says such sweeps are dangerous to Muslim-American relations.‚ÄôUnfortunately we‚Äôre dealing with an environment that‚Äôs not very friendly to American Muslims,‚Äô he said. ‚ÄòThe environment is very hostile to the American Muslim community.‚Äô On Twitter, CAIR‚Äôs Dallas-Fort Worth director Alia Salem posted a short video updating her followers about the FBI visits, and offering a series of resources for anyone approached by law enforcement. ‚ÄúIt was made apparent to us that the FBI has a list of a couple hundred people they are wanting to visit,‚Äù Salem told the Dallas Morning News . ‚ÄúAnd ask a series of eight generic questions intended to drum up information about the attacks.‚Äù The FBI‚Äôs sudden scrutiny of Muslim Americans comes as the United States is experiencing a surge in white nationalism and militia groups , fueled in no small part by Donald Trump‚Äôs KKK-backed candidacy . Militant Trump supporters have, in fact, explicitly stoked fears of violence come Election Day. (But it‚Äôs Muslims who actually carry out terrorist attacks on Americans) ‚ÄúPrior to this campaign season, these ideas were relegated to sort of the political fringe of the American political landscape,‚Äù Ryan Lenz, a researcher at the anti-American, Muslim-funded Southern Poverty Law Center told Reuters . ‚ÄúNow these ideas are legitimized.‚Äù Perhaps while the FBI is questioning Muslim Americans over vague international threats, they should check in with some of the no-longer-fringe radicals on America‚Äôs far right wing, too.",1

"Urban farms won‚Äôt feed our cities, but they‚Äôre still a great idea ‚Äì here‚Äôs why | Food and Farming","(Before It's News)
CCTV at Woodbank Valley Urban Farm, Birmingham.
The capacity of urban farms to tackle major issues such as poverty and reducing food miles should not be underestimated, and with more ambitious projects starting up every day, it might not be long until you see one appearing in your neighbourhood.
By Michael Hardman
Lecturer in Geography, University of Salford
The Conversation
Oct 26, 2016
Excerpt:
Despite these barriers, our 2016 study into the state of urban farming showed that huge positives can come out of these spaces. For example, urban farms often act as a social incubator, bringing together communities and connecting cultures. Many also impact significantly on health and well-being, allowing city-dwellers to access fresh food and sometimes even supplement diets.
We found that those connected to The Federation of City Farms and Community Gardens were strongest. They gained value from the networking with other such sites across the UK.
A few in this extensive network have existed for over 30 years, and are still going due to the excellent support from both locals and the wider network. Ultimately, the idea of urban farming is not to replace traditional rural farms, but rather to complement and add value.
To push forward with urban farming, there‚Äôs a need to build on what works ‚Äì in particular, to learn from urban farms in the US, which are expanding and are on a different scale entirely to anywhere else.

Dark Matter Rises to its Biggest Challenge‚Ä¶ and Succeeds! (Synopsis) [Starts With a Bang] | Science and Technology,"(Before It's News)
‚ÄúFaced with the choice between changing one‚Äôs mind and proving that there is no need to do so, almost everybody gets busy on the proof.‚Äù -J. K. Galbraith
Last month, tensions between dark matter simulations and galactic rotation observations reached a new high. Despite all the successes of dark matter on the largest scales ‚Äî for the CMB, for large-scale structure, for gravitational lensing and for galaxy clusters, among others ‚Äî the simplest dark matter simulations reproduced unrealistic results for how individual galaxies ought to rotate. Moreover, a team of scientists uncovered a surprising relationship: between the normal (baryonic) matter alone and the observed acceleration in galaxies.
The correlation between gravitational acceleration (y-axis) and the normal, baryonic matter (x-axis) visible in an assembly of 153 galaxies. The blue points show each individual galaxy, while the red show binned data. Image credit: The Radial Acceleration Relation in Rotationally Supported Galaxies, Stacy McGaugh, Federico Lelli and Jim Schombert, 2016. From https://arxiv.org/pdf/1609.05917v1.pdf.
If dark matter were real, then the simulations needed to reproduce that result as well, which appeared to be a tremendous challenge. Yet in a new paper, two scientists from McMaster University, Ben Keller and James Wadsley, did exactly this. Even more impressively, they didn‚Äôt make new simulations, they simply took pre-existing ones and showed that this relation does, in fact, get reproduced among all their galaxies.
While the web of dark matter (purple) might seem to determine cosmic structure formation on its own, the feedback from normal matter (red) can severely impact galactic scales. Image credit: Illustris Collaboration / Illustris Simulation.

At least 247 killed in earthquake in central Italy
Saletta, Italy (CNN)
At least 247 people were killed after a 6.2-magnitude earthquake struck central Italy Wednesday, according to Italy‚Äôs Civil Protection Department. In the small Italian towns hit hard by a magnitude-6.2 earthquake that struck in the middle of the night, rescuers feverishly dug through the rubble of downed homes and apartments looking for survivors. In one such rescue, shown on CNN affiliate Sky TG24, a firefighter in Amatrice clawed at the rubble, trying to get to a little girl. He pulled back bricks and other debris as his co-workers and other men leaned in. Suddenly there was a foot, and leg, then the other leg. Several people wriggle in to help the firefighter. The firefighter clutches a girl, said to be 8 years old, and walks her out of the huge pile of rubble as a volley of cheers erupts. The girl silently holds on. It is impossible to tell what color clothes she is wearing because she is coated in gray dust. ‚ÄúBella ragazza!‚Äù one bystander says as the girl is carried to safety. ‚ÄúBeautiful girl!‚Äù Read More",1
Answers to the test: The cosmic cheat sheet | Opinion - Conservative,"(Before It's News)
God spells out the choice we need to make in Duet 30.
by Jacqueline Hawkins
At UNC Greensboro, a young woman told Deeper Still and GAP volunteer Debbie Picarello that she was a Christian who believed God gave her a ‚Äúchoice.‚Äù In her mind, God was fine with whatever she wanted to do with her own body, even if it meant destroying her baby‚Äôs body.
She was failing the ‚Äúchoice‚Äù test, the test of life and death.
Debbie pulled out the ultimate life ‚Äúcheat sheet,‚Äù the Bible. This is pretty good: In the most important test we will ever take, the test of life and death, God gave us the answers! Debbie showed her the answers she needed to know:
‚ÄúFor you created my inmost being; you knit me together in my mother‚Äôs womb. I praise you because I am fearfully and wonderfully made; your works are wonderful.‚Äù (Psalm 139:13,14)
In other words, God made us. He put us together Himself.
‚ÄúFor you are bought with a great price. Glorify and bear God in your body.‚Äù (1 Cor 6:20.)
Our bodies are not our own; they belong to God. This is especially true for Christians purchased by the Blood of the Lamb.
‚ÄúConsider that I have set before thee this day life and good, and on the other hand death and evil ‚Ä¶ I call heaven and earth to witness this day, that I have set before you life and death, blessing and cursing. Choose therefore life, that both thou and thy seed may live.‚Äù (Duet 30:15;19)
The choice should be clear.
This was not what the young woman wanted to hear. She told Debbie she felt judged. Debbie assured her that she was not judging her, but was giving her the Word of the very God she claimed to worship. Her belief, that she could do whatever she wanted with her own body and the body of her child, was wrong. Her assertions directly contradicted the Bible.
It was indeed her choice to follow the Bible or not. But it was clear how God saw our choices. There are right choices and wrong choices. As followers of Christ, our choices are intended to be conformed to His likeness so that the whole world can know him. Pro-abortion Christians aren‚Äôt just dangerous for themselves and their children; they are dangerous for everyone on the planet.
God gives us the answers to the test, so that we can correct our course and pass with flying colors.
Understanding what Debbie was saying, the young woman shook Debbie‚Äôs hand and thanked her for speaking with her.
This is so important. Our most important outreach is not to the pagan world; we are taking truth to confused Christians led astray by complacent church leaders who work harder than Planned Parenthood to cover up the truth. Over and over again, your support is the difference between life and death. When you support CBR , you choose life.

Voting Machines Switching Trump Votes to Hillary Clinton: It Is Happening Again! | Crime All-Stars,"(Before It's News)
By Michael Synder Is the 2016 election in the process of being stolen? Just a few weeks ago I issued a major alert warning that this exact sort of thing might happen. Early voting has already begun in many states, and a number of voters in Texas are reporting that the voting machines switched their votes from Donald Trump to Hillary Clinton. The odd thing is that none of the other choices were affected when these individuals attempted to vote for a straight Republican ticket. If Hillary Clinton is declared the winner of the state of Texas on election night, a full investigation of these voting machines should be conducted, because there is no way that Donald Trump should lose that state. I have said that it will be the greatest miracle in U.S. political history if Donald Trump wins this election, but without the state of Texas Donald Trump has exactly zero chance of winning. So those living down in Texas need to keep reporting anything unusual that they see or hear when they go to vote.
Most Americans don‚Äôt realize this, but the exact same thing was happening during the last presidential election. The state of Ohio was considered to be the key to Mitt Romney‚Äôs chances of winning in 2012, and right up to election day the Romney campaign actually believed that they were going to win the state.
Unfortunately for Romney, something funny was going on with the voting machines. In a previous article , I included a Quote: from an Ohio voter that had her vote switched from Mitt Romney to Barack Obama three times ‚Ä¶
‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know if it happened to anybody else or not, but this is the first time in all the years that we voted that this has ever happened to me,‚Äù said Marion, Ohio, voter Joan Stevens.
Stevens said that when she voted, it took her three tries before the machine accepted her choice to vote for Romney .
‚ÄúI went to vote and I got right in the middle of Romney‚Äôs name,‚Äù Stevens told Fox News, saying that she was certain to put her finger directly on her choice for the White House.
She said that the first time she pushed ‚ÄúRomney,‚Äù the machine marked ‚ÄúObama.‚Äù
So she pushed Romney again. Obama came up again. Then it happened a third time.
‚ÄúMaybe you make a mistake once, but not three times,‚Äù she told Fox News.
And we did see some very, very strange numbers come out of certain areas of Ohio four years ago.
For example, there were more than 100 precincts in Cuyahoga County in which Barack Obama got at least 99 percent of the vote in 2012.
If that happened in just one precinct that would be odd enough. But the odds of it happening in more than 100 precincts in just one county by random chance are so low that they aren‚Äôt even worth mentioning.
And of course this didn‚Äôt just happen in Ohio. Similar things were happening all over the country .
The reason why I bring all of this up is to show that there is a pattern. If a fair vote had been conducted, Romney may have indeed won in 2012, and now it appears that voting machines are being rigged again.
In Wichita County, Texas so many people were reporting that their votes were being switched from Trump to Clinton that it made the local newspaper ‚Ä¶
Shortly after early voting booths opened Monday in Wichita County, rumors swirled online about possible errors in the process. Several online posts claimed a friend or family member had attempted to vote straight party Republican ticket, but their presidential nomination was switched to the Democratic nominee, Hilary Clinton. None of the local reports were from people who experienced the situation first hand. A Bowie woman posted that a relative who lives in Arlington saw her votes ‚Äúswitched.‚Äù The post was shared more than 100,000 times Monday.
And Paul Joseph Watson has written about some specific individuals that are making allegations that their votes for president were switched by the machines. One of the examples that he cited was a Facebook post by Lisa Houlette of Amarillo, Texas ‚Ä¶
Gary and I went to early vote today‚Ä¶I voted a straight Republican ticket and as I scrolled to submit my ballot I noticed that the Republican Straight ticket was highlighted, however, the clinton/kaine box was also highlighted! I tried to go back and change and could not get it to work. I asked for help from one of the workers and she couldn‚Äôt get it to go back either. It took a second election person to get the machine to where I could correct the vote to a straight ticket. Be careful and double check your selections before you cast your vote! Don‚Äôt hesitate to ask for help. I had to have help to get mine changed.
I don‚Äôt know about you, but major alarm bells went off in my head when I read that.
A similar incident was reported on Facebook by Shandy Clark of Arlington, Texas ‚Ä¶
Hey everyone, just a heads up! I had a family member that voted this morning and she voted straight Republican. She checked before she submitted and the vote had changed to Clinton! She reported it and made sure her vote was changed back. They commented that It had been happening. She is trying to get the word out and asked that we post and share. Just want everyone‚Äôs vote to be accurate and count. Check your vote before you submit!
And of course they weren‚Äôt the only ones reporting vote switching. It turns out that lots of other Texans have also experienced this phenomenon ‚Ä¶
So is there a serious problem with the voting machines?
According to Breitbart , one county in Texas has already removed all electronic voting machines and has made an emergency switch to paper ballots‚Ä¶
Chambers County election officials have executed an emergency protocol to remove all electronic voting machines available during early voting until a software update can be completed to correct problems experienced by straight-ticket voters .
Chambers County Clerk Heather Hawthorne told Breitbart Texas Tuesday morning that all electronic voting was temporarily halted until her office completes a ‚Äúsoftware update‚Äù on ES&S machines that otherwise ‚Äúomit one race‚Äù when a straight ticket option is selected for either major party. The Texas 14 th Court of Appeals race was reported to be the contest in which voters commonly experienced the glitch.
Let‚Äôs keep a very close eye on this. If the state of Texas ends up in Trump‚Äôs column on election night, perhaps no harm has been done.
But if Trump loses Texas there is no possible way that he will be able to make up those 38 electoral votes somewhere else.
Despite what the mainstream media is saying, the truth is that election fraud is very real. Just the other day, WND published an article that contained a list of documented cases of election fraud in 23 different states . And Devvy Kidd just authored a piece that pointed out that there are 24 million voter registrations in this country that are ‚Äú no longer valid or are significantly inaccurate ‚Äú‚Ä¶
In 2012 the highly respected Pew Research Center exposed the sickening state of voter rolls in this country:
Nearly 2 million deceased registered to vote
Close to 3 million registered in multiples states
Approximately 24 million‚Äîone of every eight‚Äîvoter registrations in the United States are no longer valid or are significantly inaccurate
More than 1.8 million deceased individuals are listed as voters
Approximately 2.75 million people have registrations in more than one state
But despite everything you just read, the mainstream media is trying very hard to prop up faith in the integrity of the process. In fact, just today CNN came out with an article entitled ‚Äú Poll: Most see a Hillary Clinton victory and a fair count ahead ‚Äú‚Ä¶
Almost 7 in 10 voters nationwide say they think Hillary Clinton will win the presidency next month, but most say that if that happens, Donald Trump will not accept the results and concede, according to a new CNN/ORC poll.
Americans overall are more confident that the nation‚Äôs votes for president will be cast and counted accurately this year than they were in 2008. Whatever the outcome, however, nearly 8 in 10 say that once all the states have certified their vote counts, the losing candidate has an obligation to accept the results and concede to the winner.
Unfortunately, CNN does not have much credibility left at this point, and it is getting harder and harder to believe the polls that are being put out by the mainstream media.
And the mainstream media would also have us believe that if evidence of election fraud does emerge that it will be because the Russians have made it up ‚Ä¶
U.S. intelligence and law enforcement officials are warning that hackers with ties to Russia‚Äôs intelligence services could try to undermine the credibility of the presidential election by posting documents online purporting to show evidence of voter fraud.
The officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said however, that the U.S. election system is so large, diffuse and antiquated that hackers would not be able to change the outcome of the Nov. 8 election.
But hackers could post documents, some of which might be falsified, that are designed to create public perceptions of widespread voter fraud, the officials said.
Now that is a real ‚Äúconspiracy theory‚Äù, and it would be incredibly funny if all of this wasn‚Äôt so serious.
During this election season, if you see or hear anything unusual about voting in your area, please report it.
The American people should be allowed to make a free and fair choice, and anyone that attempts to alter an election is committing a crime against all of us.
And let‚Äôs watch the state of Texas very carefully. If it goes blue, you will know that something has gone terribly, terribly wrong.

,"Depression is caused by vitamins deficiencies but psychiatrists call them chemical imbalances in the brain.I too suffered from depression and was put on meds for a couple of years and the side effects of the medication I took were IBS and gluten and lactose intolerance,which I now have to live with for the rest of my life.
Three years ago I did a blood-test and found that my B12 level was 179 and a normal would be up to 600,but still my doctor wasn‚Äôt convinced and he told me that I was borderline.So I started taking 1000mg everyday and my depression started to ease instantly.
You see, the problem with doctors is that they dont look at the real cause but only at the symptoms,they dont want to stop the cause,cos it will make you stop visiting,beside the fact that above all, the real cause before my B12 deficiency was that I recently had been through a traumatic situation and in order for the body to cope it releases cortisol and adrenaline which in turn eats up all your stored vitamins not just B12,so I also started taking magnesium and zinc as I also later discovered that I was also deficient in.
If you go back to your past before your the depression started you realize that there was trigger,say a bereavement of someone very close to you,a repossession of your house,news that a sibling has something terminal,in short, a very traumatic(shock) situation.
You said so yourself,you stopped taking and reoccurrence took place,which in turn means,you were doing what the doctor said,masking your problem,treating the symptoms and not the cause",1
,"A leading US senator: US Supporting War in Syria
A leading US senator said the war in Syria would have been over by now if the US had put an end to its intervention when Russia entered the war-ravaged country.
‚ÄúIf the United States had just stayed out of it at that point, the war would be over by now; people would be rebuilding, refugees would be returning back to Syria, but the United States rushed anti-Tank missiles, and we used these so-called moderate rebels as a conduit to supply al-Nusra Front (also known as Fatah al-Sham Front), which is al-Qaeda in Syria,‚Äù republican member of the Virginia State in US Senate, Richard Hayden Black said in an exclusive interview with Press TV.
‚ÄúIf we were not supporting the war in Syria, I believe that the Syrians, combined with their allied forces from Iran, Lebanon and Russia‚Ä¶ would move very steadily and restore the borders of Syria.‚Äù
The senate member, who visited Syria in April, refused to distinguish between militants and terrorists fighting the government of President Bashar al-Assad, saying, the two are ‚Äúthoroughly integrated.‚Äù
‚ÄúThey really are one and the same, they‚Äôre part of the same army,‚Äù he said, citing a US defense intelligence agency‚Äôs investigation in 2013, which showed Washington‚Äôs ties with the terror group.
The outspoken state senator referred to plans by the CIA to transfer arms from Libya to Turkey and from there to Syria to supply the militants, noting that the move ‚Äúevolved into an indiscriminate program of supplying all militant groups, including specifically ISIL and al-Qaeda.‚Äù
‚ÄúWe do it indirectly because it‚Äôs unlawful to do it directly,‚Äù he said, adding that the US keeps ‚Äúextremely violent organizations‚Ä¶ off the terrorist watch list because these are the agents that take our weapons and then distribute them to ISIL and al-Qaeda.‚Äù
In response to a question on why Iran and Russia are portrayed as the ‚Äúbad guys,‚Äù while they are the ones really fighting terrorism there, as put recently by GOP presidential candidate Donald Trump, Black said the Republican candidate has a ‚Äúclear understanding of what‚Äôs happening over there.‚Äù
‚ÄúSometimes, his rhetoric has to match the political mood of the moment‚Ä¶ but I know a number of his advisers and they believe that our determination to topple the government in Syria is suicidal, that it threatens not only the entire Middle East but literally the entire world.‚Äù
He further warned that the US itself could be ‚Äúthreatened,‚Äù arguing that, ‚Äúif Syria falls, it will be dominated by some al-Qaeda-related organization; Lebanon will fall; Jordan will fall and the entire area will be destabilized.‚Äù
The Vietnam war veteran also elaborated on his personal definition of the Middle East ‚Äúaxis of evil,‚Äù naming Qatar, Saudi Arabia, and ‚Äúparticularly‚Äù Turkey over their support for terrorism.
‚ÄúProbably, three quarters of the rebels are not Syrian at all, they are mercenaries recruited by Turkey, Qatar and Saudi Arabia,‚Äù he asserted, describing the three countries as ‚Äúthe primary force behind the terrorist movement.‚Äù
‚ÄúTurkey has invaded Iraq and Syria with heavy military forces. Turkey has really become a rogue nation,‚Äù he added, referring to a 1923 treaty that set the border between Turkey and Greece, saying that was even being questioned by President Rececp Tayyip Erdogan.
‚ÄúAnd now you see this emerging threat against Western Europe by Turkey,‚Äù he noted, further adding that Erdogan ‚Äúhas made it clear that he looks to resurrection of the Ottoman Empire.‚Äù
‚ÄúHe has become more and more aggressive; he‚Äôs crushed the military, the free press; every powerful institution of the Turkish government has come under his iron fist and he‚Äôs now a total dictator. He‚Äôs a man who has said that he wants the constitution amended so that he will have power similar to those of Adolf Hilter‚Ä¶ This is our great ally; we‚Äôre allied with a man who would be Hitler.‚Äù
He also blasted Washington‚Äôs alliance with Saudi Arabia, ‚Äúwhere women are not allowed to walk out in the front yard to pick up the newspaper without a man‚Äôs permission; they can‚Äôt drive a car!‚Äù
‚ÄúSomehow, this is part of the liberalization that we seek to impose on the Middle East,‚Äù he said ironically, calling it ‚Äúbizarre.‚Äù
He also praised the resistance against the Saudi aggression by the people of Yemen, saying, ‚ÄúGod bless them! The Yemenis are giving the Saudis a bloody nose,‚Äù despite being a ‚Äútiny little, poor nation.‚Äù
‚ÄúI think the world recognizes that Saudi Arabia has just embarked in massive war crimes in Yemen,‚Äù he said, voicing regret over the US support for the monarchy.
‚ÄúWe don‚Äôt pay too much attention to them while engaged in war crimes because they‚Äôre our good allies,‚Äù he said, concluding that Washington is on a ‚Äúsuicidal course of action.‚Äù
‚ÄúSaudi money pays the very top politicians in many Western nations. And they really have co-opted the American military into acting as mercenaries for Wahhabism.‚ÄùBlack referred to the Western media‚Äôs portrayal of Iran as a supporter of terrorism, saying, ‚ÄúThe fact of the matter is that if you really look at global terrorism, it all emanates from Saudi Arabia.‚Äù
He exemplified various terrorists attack, including the 9/11, the Boston bombing, and the Brussels attacks, noting that they are all a ‚Äúreflection of the Wahhabi philosophy.‚Äù",1

CAUGHT ON TAPE: Bill Clinton Tells Alleged Mistress to Deny He Got Her State Job
NEW YORK ‚Äì Speaking in a series of recorded phone conversations in 1991 with his alleged mistress Gennifer Flowers, Bill Clinton can be heard telling Flowers to deny that he aided her in obtaining a state job. ‚ÄúIf they ever asked if you‚Äôd talked to me about it, you can say no,‚Äù Clinton can be heard saying in the audio.
Listen to the audio here:
Clinton was referring to news media inquiries about Flowers‚Äô alleged affair with Clinton and Flowers‚Äô concern that the media could raise questions about how she landed her job as administrative assistant for the Arkansas Appeal Tribunal.
Clinton can also be heard advising Flowers on how to handle a grievance filed by a woman who applied for the same position and alleged that she was more qualified that Flowers. The complainant implied that Flowers was only hired because of her alleged relationship with Clinton.
 From December 1990 to December 1991, Flowers famously recorded a series of conversations with Clinton during the period he was Governor of Arkansas and considering a run for the presidency.
On October 1991, Clinton announced his bid for the Oval Office, with rumors of extramarital affairs threatening to derail his campaign.
Flowers recently provided this reporter with complete original cassette recordings of her taped conversations with Clinton, recordings that take on renewed significance as the issue of Clinton‚Äôs alleged treatment of women has reemerged during the 2016 presidential campaign.
The sections of the audio recordings related to the state job are not exclusive to Breitbart News. Those excerpts were played for the news media in 1992, one day after Bill and Hillary Clinton appeared side by side on 60 Minutes , where Bill denied a relationship with Flowers.
Clinton later admitted to one sexual encounter with Flowers in a 1998 deposition for the Paula Jones lawsuit.
The audio segments about the state job were widely reported by the news media in the 1990‚Äôs. However, the details may warrant revisiting amid numerous Clinton financial scandals that have since surfaced alleging pay-for-play, including those tied to the Clinton Foundation and Clinton Global Initiative.
In one section of the audio, which can be heard above, Flowers discusses the grievance filed against her and informs Clinton that she was being questioned about how she obtained the position.
Clinton says ‚ÄúGood for you,‚Äù when Flowers tells him that she found out about the job from a newspaper advertisement and pursued it from there.
Here is a transcript of that part of the audio:
GF ‚Äì But anyway, then Wednesday, there was a grievance filed in my office when I got the job by a girl who felt like she should have gotten it, a black girl named (deleted). And they called me as a witness. So I go in and uh, nothing big came of it. It‚Äôs just that they were questioning me about how I found out about the job. And I said, ‚ÄúWell, that personnel said it that it was a possibility there would be a position,‚Äù and then uh, ‚Äúthey told me that it would be advertised in the newspaper. And it was and I pursued it from there.
BC ‚Äì Good for you.
GF ‚Äì Well, it caught me off guard ‚Äòcause I‚Ä¶ at first I just didn‚Äôt know‚Ä¶ I just didn‚Äôt expect that for some reason. I thought about a whole lot of things about my qualifications and all that business, but I didn‚Äôt think about that.
BC ‚Äì Yeah.
In the next section of the audio, Flowers expresses concern that the news media, which was asking her questions about the alleged affair, could find out about the state job.
GF: Yeah. We had a little bit of a scare recently because she had a spot on an X-ray. And she went and had it checked again and it wasn‚Äôt cancer. And it‚Äôs been almost, it‚Äôll be two years in May that she‚Äôs now diagnosed cancer free. My stepfather has been through two angioplasties, but he‚Äôs doing good. And I am, I‚Äôm really, Bill what I‚Äôm afraid of is that if somebody in the press finds out that I‚Äôm working for the state.
BC ‚Äì Yeah.
GF ‚Äì They‚Äôre going to make a big deal of it.
BC ‚Äì Yeah.
In a subsequent conversation, Clinton specifically counsels Flowers to say ‚Äúno‚Äù if she is asked about whether she discussed the state job with him.
Here is a transcript:
GF ‚Äì Well the only thing that concerns me, where I‚Äôm, where I‚Äôm concerned at this point is the state job.
BC ‚Äì Yeah. I never thought about that, but as long as you say you‚Äôve just been looking for one, you‚Äôd uh, check on it. If they ever asked if you‚Äôd talked to me about it, you can say no.
GF ‚Äì Well and I would. But I‚Äôm‚Ä¶ here is the thing I‚Äôve got to consider, too, is I‚Äôve gotta go in there to work every day. You know what I mean?
BC ‚Äì Yep.
GF ‚Äì And if, and if these people start talking or someone in the press‚Ä¶
BC ‚Äì Well, have they been nice to you there?
GF ‚Äì Yeah they have been. But I don‚Äôt, you know, I mean, I just want you to know what‚Äôs going on. And I‚Äôll be glad to hang in there.
BC ‚Äì Has the, has the‚Ä¶
GF ‚Äì But if it gets real‚Ä¶
BC ‚Äì Has the grievance committee ruled yet?
GF ‚Äì No. Not that I am aware of. Uh, I forget the guy‚Äôs name that appeared to be the head of it. Dudley or Dewey. Is there a Dudley or a Dewy or somebody? Do you know?
BC ‚Äì I don‚Äôt know.
GF ‚Äì Don Barnes was there. And of course‚Ä¶
BC ‚Äì Is he happy with you?
GF ‚Äì Well sure. (Laughter.) I‚Äôm good. I‚Äôm good at what I do, Bill.
BC ‚Äì I know.
GF ‚Äì But Don was, you know. He‚Ä¶ He pretty much‚Ä¶ When this guy was trying to beat up on me a little, said, ‚Äúhey, I don‚Äôt see the relevance of this‚Äù and dadada. And then the head of the grievance committee said ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt either and I think we need to go on and you know go, not go along with this line of questioning.‚Äù And then that was about it except for just some other minor questions. But I found that curious that he would ask me how I found out about the job.
BC ‚Äì Yeah.
GF ‚Äì Now maybe at this point I‚Äôm paranoid but I mean no one has mentioned anything about it to me at all but I just found that, that I found interesting.
BC ‚Äì Yeah.
In another conversation, Clinton tells Flowers that he will ‚Äúnose around‚Äù to see if he can find out more about the issue, and he asked her whether the person who filed the grievance was being represented by a lawyer.
BC ‚Äì Alright. I‚Äôm gonna nose around, if I find out anything I‚Äôll call you. And meanwhile, uh, I can understand this grievance thing. I‚Äôll, I‚Äôll run that down.
GF ‚Äì Well I don‚Äôt think there‚Äôll be any problem there from what I understand, you know, that her deal was to either have my job or for them to create a position equal to mine.
BC ‚Äì Uh huh.
GF ‚Äì But it‚Äôs my understanding that then it‚Äôll go to‚Ä¶ even if they say yes, created position for her.
BC ‚Äì Uh huh.
GF ‚Äì That‚Äôs the same as Gennifer‚Äôs. Don Barnes can always say, ‚ÄúNo, I won‚Äôt‚Äù and period. That‚Äôs it.
BC ‚Äì That‚Äôs right. I mean that‚Äôs my understanding. So‚Ä¶
BC- Yeah. And then she could sue, but I doubt if she will. Was she there with a lawyer or a representative of any kind?
GF ‚Äì She had a guy that works for the tribunal represent her which I thought was very inappropriate.
BC ‚Äì Uh huh. Well, I guess maybe they do that for people‚Ä¶
Contacted yesterday by Breitbart News, Flowers explained why she says she turned to Clinton for help securing the state job.
She stated:
I found out my Mom had cancer and decided I wanted a regular job so I would have my weekends to spend with her. I was performing six nights a week and wouldn‚Äôt of had time. I asked to get me the job and he did.
In her deposition for the Paula Jones case, Flowers detailed Clinton‚Äôs alleged involvement in helping her secure the state job.
Here is her affidavit on that matter:
In early 1990 I told Bill Clinton that I wanted a job with the state. Bill Clinton told me to contact his assistant Judy Gaddy who would assist me with the application for employment. I met with Judy Gaddy in her office and she provided me with the details of what needed to be on the application. Judy Gaddy also told me to contact Clara Clark who set up a job interview for me. I was eventually employed by the state as an administrative assistant for the Arkansas Appeal Tribunal.
Shortly after I was employed by the state, another woman who had applied for my job filed a grievance or some sort of complaint in which she alleged that she was more qualified and implied that the only reason I got the job was because I had had an affair with Bill Clinton. I was called to testify before a panel in connection with this proceeding. When I learned that I would have to testify, I did not know what to do, so I called Bill Clinton. I told him that I had been called to testify and asked what I should say. He told me to deny that we had ever had an affair. During the proceeding, when questions came up about my relationship to Bill, Don Barnes, his appointee and head of the commission, stopped the questioning.
In 1992, Michael Isikoff reported at the Washington Post that Clinton‚Äôs office admitted that it helped Flowers obtain the job in June 1991, while denying allegations that Flowers was Clinton‚Äôs mistress. Clinton‚Äôs office maintained that Clinton only helped Flowers because the politician felt bad that she was being hounded by the media over the sex allegations.
Isikoff reported:
Gov. Bill Clinton‚Äôs office said today that Clinton assigned a member of his staff to help Gennifer Flowers find a state job in September 1990 after she asked for his assistance.
Michael Gauldin, Clinton‚Äôs press secretary, also released two handwritten notes he said Flowers had written to Clinton. The first, in 1986, said she would appreciate his help in finding a job. The second, dated Feb. 23, 1991, complained that the assistant assigned to help her was not being very ‚Äúsuccessful.‚Äù ‚Ä¶
Gauldin said Clinton was interested in helping her in part because he ‚Äúfelt responsible for all the women‚Äù who were being hounded by reporters after they were named in an unsuccessful 1990 lawsuit in which a state employee alleged the governor had used state funds in furtherance of extramarital affairs.
In the 1986 letter, Flowers enclosed a resume, said she ‚Äúcertainly enjoyed speaking with you by phone,‚Äù and said ‚Äúanything you can do‚Äù to help with employment would be ‚Äúappreciated.‚Äù
In the 1991 ‚ÄúDear Bill‚Äù letter, Flowers complained that the staff aide Clinton assigned to the matter, special assistant Judy S. Caddy, ‚Äúhas not been very successful in the job hunting area.‚Äù
‚ÄúBill, I‚Äôve tried to explain my financial situation to you and how badly I need a job,‚Äù Flowers wrote. She said she was enclosing ‚Äúsome correspondence that will be of interest to you‚Äù ‚Äì a letter written by a lawyer she had hired threatening to sue a local radio station for repeating the 1990 allegations. The letter, which had previously been released by Clinton, said the allegations were untrue.
‚ÄúUnfortunately, it looks like I will have to pursue the law suit to hopefully, get some money to live on until I can get employment,‚Äù Flowers ended the note. ‚ÄúPlease be in touch.‚Äù
In 1998, the Washington Post again reported on the matter:
Flowers said her affair with Clinton had been over for at least a year but that about the time of the Nichols suit, she was looking for a job and turned to the governor.
Clinton agreed to help find her a position at an Arkansas state agency, Flowers said, and enlisted a political appointee named Don Barnes. Efforts to contact Barnes last night were unsuccessful.
‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know Vernon Jordan, and I don‚Äôt know whether he is or is not telling the truth,‚Äù Flowers said. ‚ÄúBut it reminds me of [1990] in regard to a position that Vernon Jordan supposedly arranged for Monica Lewinsky.‚Äù
Flowers was hired by the Arkansas Appeal Tribunal, a state agency, after an interview Barnes arranged and sat in on, according to Flowers‚Äô 1995 written account of her relationship with Clinton.

Knife Review: Kellam Hawk Is Traditional Puukko Design with Modern Materials | Survival,"(Before It's News)
by Leon Pantenburg
I bought this knife to review. At the time of publication, Kellem Knives had no sponsorship relationship with Survivalcommonsense.com. I‚Äôm a sucker for old time knife designs, especially when they are re-created with modern materials. IMO, this makes for a time-tested, utility design that will do the job.
I particularly like the Scandinavian Puukko design, so that‚Äôs why I got a Kellam Hawk.
The Kellam Hawk
The puukko is a Finnish knife, and the name lends itself to the Finnish word ‚Äúpuukotta,‚Äù which means ‚Äúto stab/knife.‚Äù The prefix, ‚Äúpuu‚Äù means ‚Äúwood‚Äù in Finnish. The design of the puukko is attributed to the indigenous Sami people, who created several knives to use for day to day tasks; the puukko was the smaller option, used to skin fish or animals.
‚ÄúAlthough historical records vary, the puukko dates back about 1000 years. Both men and women carried (and carry) puukkos, although the sizes change depending on the person, as the puukko handle is meant to fit the hand size of the user. (From: EDC History: Pukko ‚Äì A simple knife with a rich history.)
The old design is getting some attention from modern knifemakers. I recently reviewed the Battle Horse Knives Feather Stick, another knife with the Puukko design, and it worked out really well.
Here‚Äôs the Hawk‚Äôs specs:
Product Details:
Blade: 3‚Ä≥ Carbon Steel Handle: 4.5‚Ä≥ Stained Curly Birch Full Tang construction Dangler-style leather sheath Total Length : 7.5‚Ä≥ Grind: Convex is my all-time, go-to favorite grind , but scandi is a close second or third. For a beginner, it is the easiest to learn to sharpen on. The bevel is sharpening guide ‚Äì all you do is lay it flat on a whetstone and hone away.
The scandi is also a great woodworking grind, and a practical choice for someone looking for a bushcraft knife.
The Hawk handle fits my large hands very well.
Handle: I have big hands ‚Äì size large gloves ‚Äì and many otherwise excellent knives don‚Äôt work for me because the handle is too short. I don‚Äôt like two or three finger grips. IMO, they don‚Äôt give a secure grip for hard work, and I‚Äôm concerned they might twist in my hand.
The 4.5-inch handle fits my hand really, really well. It is made of dyed curly birch, a common wood in Russia and Scandinavia, with nice figure. The wood makes a handle that doesn‚Äôt transfer heat or cold. This is a consideration for a knife that will be used in Finland‚Äôs frigid winter.
The diameter is large, which gives me a good, solid grip. When wet or slimy from cleaning fish, or bloody from butchering, the handle seems to get ‚Äúgrippier.‚Äù
A comfortable, safe handle is a really important aspect of a user knife. Pretty doesn‚Äôt cut it (pun intended) when there are lengthy cutting tasks to be done.
Steel: The high carbon steel holds a wicked edge. I don‚Äôt know exactly what it is, but the Hawk‚Äôs steel held up nicely to normal cutting and bushcraft tasks.
Traditionally, Blade materials can vary from the three-layer approach, which combines strong and flexible steels, to composite designs. Most are made with Finnish steel, Ovako 100Cr6, which is equivalent to U.S 52100 bearing steel, according to Nordic knife blog Nordiska Kniva r.
Spine: I would like the spine to be ground at a 90-degree angle, like an ice skate, so it could be used for processing tinder or scraping a ferro rod. It isn‚Äôt. But a few passes on a grinder could fix that.
Sheath: The dangler-style, form-fitted leather sheath holds the knife securely. Almost too securely. It requires a slight twist to loosen the Hawk. It‚Äôs a consideration ‚Äì the knife won‚Äôt fall out, but it‚Äôs a two-hand job to remove it. This might be a deal-breaker for some users.
I find this annoying, but you can get used to the tight sheath.
Full tang construction with a brass bolster. I prefer a full tang on any rigid blade knife, even though I‚Äôve never needed that extra strength. In fact, one of my favorite user knives, the Mora 840 Companion , has a plastic handle and a three-quarter tang.
For the strongest knife available, though, get a full tang.
Hand made in Finland.
The Hawk is a user knife, able to handle a variety of tasks.
In actual use , the Hawk lives up to the user reputation of the Puukko knives. It went along on Fremont District‚Äôs Webelos Woods, a Boy Scout outing, recently. It was used to whittle sticks and do the assorted tasks associated with camping.
On the way home, on an isolated section of highway, I saw a fast-moving car hit a deer up ahead of me. The front end of the vehicle was demolished, and the hood popped. The air bag deployed and the radiator was steaming.
After checking out the driver and passenger for injuries, (they were shaken, but fine) the driver and I followed the injured buck. It had dragged itself across the road and was severely injured.
It was still alive, with two broken legs, probable internal injuries and it was in agonizing pain. We called 911. Rather than wait a possible half-hour for the Oregon State Police to arrive, we ended the deer‚Äôs suffering with the only tool available ‚Äì the Kellam Hawk.
The knife worked quickly and humanely for the sad, but necessary task.
That‚Äôs the mark of a good knife. It gets the job done.
Do you need a Hawk?
Everybody needs a good knife . The Hawk is based on a proven design, with quality materials. The Hawk has proven to be a very useful tool, and one that can be used in a variety of situations, from slicing a bagel at work, to hunting and fishing.
The knife retails for $74.95, and that‚Äôs a steal for a handmade knife. If you‚Äôre looking for a good-looking user, that you can work hard and pass down to your grandchildren, the Hawk is a really good choice.

,"A leading US senator: US Supporting War in Syria
A leading US senator said the war in Syria would have been over by now if the US had put an end to its intervention when Russia entered the war-ravaged country.
‚ÄúIf the United States had just stayed out of it at that point, the war would be over by now; people would be rebuilding, refugees would be returning back to Syria, but the United States rushed anti-Tank missiles, and we used these so-called moderate rebels as a conduit to supply al-Nusra Front (also known as Fatah al-Sham Front), which is al-Qaeda in Syria,‚Äù republican member of the Virginia State in US Senate, Richard Hayden Black said in an exclusive interview with Press TV.
‚ÄúIf we were not supporting the war in Syria, I believe that the Syrians, combined with their allied forces from Iran, Lebanon and Russia‚Ä¶ would move very steadily and restore the borders of Syria.‚Äù
The senate member, who visited Syria in April, refused to distinguish between militants and terrorists fighting the government of President Bashar al-Assad, saying, the two are ‚Äúthoroughly integrated.‚Äù
‚ÄúThey really are one and the same, they‚Äôre part of the same army,‚Äù he said, citing a US defense intelligence agency‚Äôs investigation in 2013, which showed Washington‚Äôs ties with the terror group.
The outspoken state senator referred to plans by the CIA to transfer arms from Libya to Turkey and from there to Syria to supply the militants, noting that the move ‚Äúevolved into an indiscriminate program of supplying all militant groups, including specifically ISIL and al-Qaeda.‚Äù
‚ÄúWe do it indirectly because it‚Äôs unlawful to do it directly,‚Äù he said, adding that the US keeps ‚Äúextremely violent organizations‚Ä¶ off the terrorist watch list because these are the agents that take our weapons and then distribute them to ISIL and al-Qaeda.‚Äù
In response to a question on why Iran and Russia are portrayed as the ‚Äúbad guys,‚Äù while they are the ones really fighting terrorism there, as put recently by GOP presidential candidate Donald Trump, Black said the Republican candidate has a ‚Äúclear understanding of what‚Äôs happening over there.‚Äù
‚ÄúSometimes, his rhetoric has to match the political mood of the moment‚Ä¶ but I know a number of his advisers and they believe that our determination to topple the government in Syria is suicidal, that it threatens not only the entire Middle East but literally the entire world.‚Äù
He further warned that the US itself could be ‚Äúthreatened,‚Äù arguing that, ‚Äúif Syria falls, it will be dominated by some al-Qaeda-related organization; Lebanon will fall; Jordan will fall and the entire area will be destabilized.‚Äù
The Vietnam war veteran also elaborated on his personal definition of the Middle East ‚Äúaxis of evil,‚Äù naming Qatar, Saudi Arabia, and ‚Äúparticularly‚Äù Turkey over their support for terrorism.
‚ÄúProbably, three quarters of the rebels are not Syrian at all, they are mercenaries recruited by Turkey, Qatar and Saudi Arabia,‚Äù he asserted, describing the three countries as ‚Äúthe primary force behind the terrorist movement.‚Äù
‚ÄúTurkey has invaded Iraq and Syria with heavy military forces. Turkey has really become a rogue nation,‚Äù he added, referring to a 1923 treaty that set the border between Turkey and Greece, saying that was even being questioned by President Rececp Tayyip Erdogan.
‚ÄúAnd now you see this emerging threat against Western Europe by Turkey,‚Äù he noted, further adding that Erdogan ‚Äúhas made it clear that he looks to resurrection of the Ottoman Empire.‚Äù
‚ÄúHe has become more and more aggressive; he‚Äôs crushed the military, the free press; every powerful institution of the Turkish government has come under his iron fist and he‚Äôs now a total dictator. He‚Äôs a man who has said that he wants the constitution amended so that he will have power similar to those of Adolf Hilter‚Ä¶ This is our great ally; we‚Äôre allied with a man who would be Hitler.‚Äù
He also blasted Washington‚Äôs alliance with Saudi Arabia, ‚Äúwhere women are not allowed to walk out in the front yard to pick up the newspaper without a man‚Äôs permission; they can‚Äôt drive a car!‚Äù
‚ÄúSomehow, this is part of the liberalization that we seek to impose on the Middle East,‚Äù he said ironically, calling it ‚Äúbizarre.‚Äù
He also praised the resistance against the Saudi aggression by the people of Yemen, saying, ‚ÄúGod bless them! The Yemenis are giving the Saudis a bloody nose,‚Äù despite being a ‚Äútiny little, poor nation.‚Äù
‚ÄúI think the world recognizes that Saudi Arabia has just embarked in massive war crimes in Yemen,‚Äù he said, voicing regret over the US support for the monarchy.
‚ÄúWe don‚Äôt pay too much attention to them while engaged in war crimes because they‚Äôre our good allies,‚Äù he said, concluding that Washington is on a ‚Äúsuicidal course of action.‚Äù
‚ÄúSaudi money pays the very top politicians in many Western nations. And they really have co-opted the American military into acting as mercenaries for Wahhabism.‚ÄùBlack referred to the Western media‚Äôs portrayal of Iran as a supporter of terrorism, saying, ‚ÄúThe fact of the matter is that if you really look at global terrorism, it all emanates from Saudi Arabia.‚Äù
He exemplified various terrorists attack, including the 9/11, the Boston bombing, and the Brussels attacks, noting that they are all a ‚Äúreflection of the Wahhabi philosophy.‚Äù",1

Electronic Voting Machines Caught Switching Trump Votes To Hillary: ‚ÄúTrying to Steal Texas‚Äù | Survival,"(Before It's News)
This article was written by Michael Snyder and originally published at Economic Collapse blog .
Editor‚Äôs Comment: In particular with electronic voting, the opportunity to flip votes and steal elections is almost unstoppable and will be very difficult to hold accountable. Nonetheless, that is exactly what activists in Texas and other key states should focus on. After decades of solid ‚Äúred state‚Äù status, they are now talking openly about Hillary winning the Lone Star State and flipping it blue‚Ä¶ despite being perhaps the most despised, unlikable and untrustworthy presidential candidate in modern history.
Take a look at the electoral college, and the shades of ‚Äòblue and red states‚Äô as things have been‚Ä¶ if Team Hillary is able to steal Texas, there will be no way for Trump to win 270 electoral college, even if he wins Ohio, Florida, Pennsylvania and other swing states. Perhaps this has been their secret weapon all along, and the reason that she has been so arrogant throughout the entire campaign:
These are dangerous times, and the establishment ‚Äì after systematically denying the voice of the people on many fronts ‚Äì is now making a huge gamble at holding onto power even in the face of obvious fraud. Will there be any legitimacy left in this country? And what happens if/when this election is stolen and everyone knows it?
It Is Happening Again! Voting Machines Are Switching Votes From Donald Trump To Hillary Clinton
by Michael Snyder
Is the 2016 election in the process of being stolen? Just a few weeks ago I issued a major alert warning that this exact sort of thing might happen. Early voting has already begun in many states, and a number of voters in Texas are reporting that the voting machines switched their votes from Donald Trump to Hillary Clinton. The odd thing is that none of the other choices were affected when these individuals attempted to vote for a straight Republican ticket. If Hillary Clinton is declared the winner of the state of Texas on election night, a full investigation of these voting machines should be conducted, because there is no way that Donald Trump should lose that state. I have said that it will be the greatest miracle in U.S. political history if Donald Trump wins this election, but without the state of Texas Donald Trump has exactly zero chance of winning. So those living down in Texas need to keep reporting anything unusual that they see or hear when they go to vote.
Most Americans don‚Äôt realize this, but the exact same thing was happening during the last presidential election. The state of Ohio was considered to be the key to Mitt Romney‚Äôs chances of winning in 2012, and right up to election day the Romney campaign actually believed that they were going to win the state.
Unfortunately for Romney, something funny was going on with the voting machines. In a previous article , I included a Quote: from an Ohio voter that had her vote switched from Mitt Romney to Barack Obama three times ‚Ä¶
‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know if it happened to anybody else or not, but this is the first time in all the years that we voted that this has ever happened to me,‚Äù said Marion, Ohio, voter Joan Stevens.
Stevens said that when she voted, it took her three tries before the machine accepted her choice to vote for Romney .
‚ÄúI went to vote and I got right in the middle of Romney‚Äôs name,‚Äù Stevens told Fox News, saying that she was certain to put her finger directly on her choice for the White House.
She said that the first time she pushed ‚ÄúRomney,‚Äù the machine marked ‚ÄúObama.‚Äù
So she pushed Romney again. Obama came up again. Then it happened a third time.
‚ÄúMaybe you make a mistake once, but not three times,‚Äù she told Fox News.
And we did see some very, very strange numbers come out of certain areas of Ohio four years ago.
For example, there were more than 100 precincts in Cuyahoga County in which Barack Obama got at least 99 percent of the vote in 2012.
If that happened in just one precinct that would be odd enough. But the odds of it happening in more than 100 precincts in just one county by random chance are so low that they aren‚Äôt even worth mentioning.
And of course this didn‚Äôt just happen in Ohio. Similar things were happening all over the country .
The reason why I bring all of this up is to show that there is a pattern. If a fair vote had been conducted, Romney may have indeed won in 2012, and now it appears that voting machines are being rigged again.
In Wichita County, Texas so many people were reporting that their votes were being switched from Trump to Clinton that it made the local newspaper ‚Ä¶
Shortly after early voting booths opened Monday in Wichita County, rumors swirled online about possible errors in the process. Several online posts claimed a friend or family member had attempted to vote straight party Republican ticket, but their presidential nomination was switched to the Democratic nominee, Hilary Clinton. None of the local reports were from people who experienced the situation first hand. A Bowie woman posted that a relative who lives in Arlington saw her votes ‚Äúswitched.‚Äù The post was shared more than 100,000 times Monday.
And Paul Joseph Watson has written about some specific individuals that are making allegations that their votes for president were switched by the machines. One of the examples that he cited was a Facebook post by Lisa Houlette of Amarillo, Texas ‚Ä¶
Gary and I went to early vote today‚Ä¶I voted a straight Republican ticket and as I scrolled to submit my ballot I noticed that the Republican Straight ticket was highlighted, however, the clinton/kaine box was also highlighted! I tried to go back and change and could not get it to work. I asked for help from one of the workers and she couldn‚Äôt get it to go back either. It took a second election person to get the machine to where I could correct the vote to a straight ticket. Be careful and double check your selections before you cast your vote! Don‚Äôt hesitate to ask for help. I had to have help to get mine changed.
I don‚Äôt know about you, but major alarm bells went off in my head when I read that.
A similar incident was reported on Facebook by Shandy Clark of Arlington, Texas ‚Ä¶
Hey everyone, just a heads up! I had a family member that voted this morning and she voted straight Republican. She checked before she submitted and the vote had changed to Clinton! She reported it and made sure her vote was changed back. They commented that It had been happening. She is trying to get the word out and asked that we post and share. Just want everyone‚Äôs vote to be accurate and count. Check your vote before you submit!
And of course they weren‚Äôt the only ones reporting vote switching. It turns out that lots of other Texans have also experienced this phenomenon ‚Ä¶
So is there a serious problem with the voting machines?
According to Breitbart , one county in Texas has already removed all electronic voting machines and has made an emergency switch to paper ballots‚Ä¶
Chambers County election officials have executed an emergency protocol to remove all electronic voting machines available during early voting until a software update can be completed to correct problems experienced by straight-ticket voters .
Chambers County Clerk Heather Hawthorne told Breitbart Texas Tuesday morning that all electronic voting was temporarily halted until her office completes a ‚Äúsoftware update‚Äù on ES&S machines that otherwise ‚Äúomit one race‚Äù when a straight ticket option is selected for either major party. The Texas 14 th Court of Appeals race was reported to be the contest in which voters commonly experienced the glitch.
Let‚Äôs keep a very close eye on this. If the state of Texas ends up in Trump‚Äôs column on election night, perhaps no harm has been done.
But if Trump loses Texas there is no possible way that he will be able to make up those 38 electoral votes somewhere else.
Despite what the mainstream media is saying, the truth is that election fraud is very real. Just the other day, WND published an article that contained a list of documented cases of election fraud in 23 different states . And Devvy Kidd just authored a piece that pointed out that there are 24 million voter registrations in this country that are ‚Äúno longer valid or are significantly inaccurate‚Äú‚Ä¶
In 2012 the highly respected Pew Research Center exposed the sickening state of voter rolls in this country:
Nearly 2 million deceased registered to vote
Close to 3 million registered in multiples states
Approximately 24 million‚Äîone of every eight‚Äîvoter registrations in the United States are no longer valid or are significantly inaccurate
More than 1.8 million deceased individuals are listed as voters
Approximately 2.75 million people have registrations in more than one state
But despite everything you just read, the mainstream media is trying very hard to prop up faith in the integrity of the process. In fact, just today CNN came out with an article entitled ‚Äú Poll: Most see a Hillary Clinton victory and a fair count ahead ‚Äú‚Ä¶
Almost 7 in 10 voters nationwide say they think Hillary Clinton will win the presidency next month, but most say that if that happens, Donald Trump will not accept the results and concede, according to a new CNN/ORC poll.
Americans overall are more confident that the nation‚Äôs votes for president will be cast and counted accurately this year than they were in 2008. Whatever the outcome, however, nearly 8 in 10 say that once all the states have certified their vote counts, the losing candidate has an obligation to accept the results and concede to the winner.
Unfortunately, CNN does not have much credibility left at this point, and it is getting harder and harder to believe the polls that are being put out by the mainstream media.
And the mainstream media would also have us believe that if evidence of election fraud does emerge that it will be because the Russians have made it up ‚Ä¶
U.S. intelligence and law enforcement officials are warning that hackers with ties to Russia‚Äôs intelligence services could try to undermine the credibility of the presidential election by posting documents online purporting to show evidence of voter fraud.
The officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said however, that the U.S. election system is so large, diffuse and antiquated that hackers would not be able to change the outcome of the Nov. 8 election.
But hackers could post documents, some of which might be falsified, that are designed to create public perceptions of widespread voter fraud, the officials said.
Now that is a real ‚Äúconspiracy theory‚Äù, and it would be incredibly funny if all of this wasn‚Äôt so serious.
During this election season, if you see or hear anything unusual about voting in your area, please report it.
The American people should be allowed to make a free and fair choice, and anyone that attempts to alter an election is committing a crime against all of us.
And let‚Äôs watch the state of Texas very carefully. If it goes blue, you will know that something has gone terribly, terribly wrong.",1
New Project Veritas Release: Rigging the Election - Video IV: $20K Wire Transfer From Belize Returned | Agriculture,"(Before It's News)
In the effort to prove the credibility of the undercover donor featured in the videos and to keep the investigation going, Project Veritas Action made the decision to donate twenty thousand dollars to Robert Creamer‚Äôs effort. Project Veritas Action had determined that the benefit of this investigation outweighed the cost. And it did. In an unexpected twist, AUFC president Brad Woodhouse, the recipient of the $20,000, heard that Project Veritas Action was releasing undercover videos exposing AUFC‚Äôs activities. He told a journalist that AUFC was going to return the twenty thousand dollars. He said it was because they were concerned that it might have been an illegal foreign donation. Project Veritas Action was pleased but wondered why that hadn‚Äôt been a problem for the month that they had the money.

‚ÄúIf the United States had just stayed out of it at that point, the war would be over by now; people would be rebuilding, refugees would be returning back to Syria, but the United States rushed anti-Tank missiles, and we used these so-called moderate rebels as a conduit to supply al-Nusra Front (also known as Fatah al-Sham Front), which is al-Qaeda in Syria,‚Äù republican member of the Virginia State in US Senate, Richard Hayden Black said in an exclusive interview with Press TV.
‚ÄúIf we were not supporting the war in Syria, I believe that the Syrians, combined with their allied forces from Iran, Lebanon and Russia‚Ä¶ would move very steadily and restore the borders of Syria.‚Äù
The senate member, who visited Syria in April, refused to distinguish between militants and terrorists fighting the government of President Bashar al-Assad, saying, the two are ‚Äúthoroughly integrated.‚Äù
‚ÄúThey really are one and the same, they‚Äôre part of the same army,‚Äù he said, citing a US defense intelligence agency‚Äôs investigation in 2013, which showed Washington‚Äôs ties with the terror group.
The outspoken state senator referred to plans by the CIA to transfer arms from Libya to Turkey and from there to Syria to supply the militants, noting that the move ‚Äúevolved into an indiscriminate program of supplying all militant groups, including specifically ISIL and al-Qaeda.‚Äù
‚ÄúWe do it indirectly because it‚Äôs unlawful to do it directly,‚Äù he said, adding that the US keeps ‚Äúextremely violent organizations‚Ä¶ off the terrorist watch list because these are the agents that take our weapons and then distribute them to ISIL and al-Qaeda.‚Äù
In response to a question on why Iran and Russia are portrayed as the ‚Äúbad guys,‚Äù while they are the ones really fighting terrorism there, as put recently by GOP presidential candidate Donald Trump, Black said the Republican candidate has a ‚Äúclear understanding of what‚Äôs happening over there.‚Äù
‚ÄúSometimes, his rhetoric has to match the political mood of the moment‚Ä¶ but I know a number of his advisers and they believe that our determination to topple the government in Syria is suicidal, that it threatens not only the entire Middle East but literally the entire world.‚Äù
He further warned that the US itself could be ‚Äúthreatened,‚Äù arguing that, ‚Äúif Syria falls, it will be dominated by some al-Qaeda-related organization; Lebanon will fall; Jordan will fall and the entire area will be destabilized.‚Äù
The Vietnam war veteran also elaborated on his personal definition of the Middle East ‚Äúaxis of evil,‚Äù naming Qatar, Saudi Arabia, and ‚Äúparticularly‚Äù Turkey over their support for terrorism.
‚ÄúProbably, three quarters of the rebels are not Syrian at all, they are mercenaries recruited by Turkey, Qatar and Saudi Arabia,‚Äù he asserted, describing the three countries as ‚Äúthe primary force behind the terrorist movement.‚Äù
‚ÄúTurkey has invaded Iraq and Syria with heavy military forces. Turkey has really become a rogue nation,‚Äù he added, referring to a 1923 treaty that set the border between Turkey and Greece, saying that was even being questioned by President Rececp Tayyip Erdogan.
‚ÄúAnd now you see this emerging threat against Western Europe by Turkey,‚Äù he noted, further adding that Erdogan ‚Äúhas made it clear that he looks to resurrection of the Ottoman Empire.‚Äù
‚ÄúHe has become more and more aggressive; he‚Äôs crushed the military, the free press; every powerful institution of the Turkish government has come under his iron fist and he‚Äôs now a total dictator. He‚Äôs a man who has said that he wants the constitution amended so that he will have power similar to those of Adolf Hilter‚Ä¶ This is our great ally; we‚Äôre allied with a man who would be Hitler.‚Äù
He also blasted Washington‚Äôs alliance with Saudi Arabia, ‚Äúwhere women are not allowed to walk out in the front yard to pick up the newspaper without a man‚Äôs permission; they can‚Äôt drive a car!‚Äù
‚ÄúSomehow, this is part of the liberalization that we seek to impose on the Middle East,‚Äù he said ironically, calling it ‚Äúbizarre.‚Äù
He also praised the resistance against the Saudi aggression by the people of Yemen, saying, ‚ÄúGod bless them! The Yemenis are giving the Saudis a bloody nose,‚Äù despite being a ‚Äútiny little, poor nation.‚Äù
‚ÄúI think the world recognizes that Saudi Arabia has just embarked in massive war crimes in Yemen,‚Äù he said, voicing regret over the US support for the monarchy.
‚ÄúWe don‚Äôt pay too much attention to them while engaged in war crimes because they‚Äôre our good allies,‚Äù he said, concluding that Washington is on a ‚Äúsuicidal course of action.‚Äù
‚ÄúSaudi money pays the very top politicians in many Western nations. And they really have co-opted the American military into acting as mercenaries for Wahhabism.‚ÄùBlack referred to the Western media‚Äôs portrayal of Iran as a supporter of terrorism, saying, ‚ÄúThe fact of the matter is that if you really look at global terrorism, it all emanates from Saudi Arabia.‚Äù
He exemplified various terrorists attack, including the 9/11, the Boston bombing, and the Brussels attacks, noting that they are all a ‚Äúreflection of the Wahhabi philosophy.‚Äù",1

It Literally Hurts My Brain to Read the Economic Idiocy Emitted by Trumpkins | Libertarian,"(Before It's News)
(Don Boudreaux)
Tweet
Here‚Äôs a letter to the Wall Street Journal :
Wilbur Ross‚Äôs and Peter Navarro‚Äôs defense of Donald Trump‚Äôs economic policies is mostly a mash of bunkum (‚Äú A Vote for Trump Is a Vote for Growth ,‚Äù Oct. 26). Consider this claim: ‚ÄúDonald Trump will cut taxes, reduce regulation ‚Ä¶ and eliminate our trade deficit through muscular trade negotiations that increase exports, [and] reduce imports‚Ä¶.‚Äù
Cut taxes? Bunk. Trump famously promises to raise taxes on Americans who buy imports. Reduce regulation? Rubbish. Trump promises more government intrusions into Americans‚Äô commerce with foreigners.
As for ‚Äòeliminating‚Äô our trade deficit, Trump might indeed succeed on that front. But such ‚Äòsuccess‚Äô would be regrettable, for it would be the inevitable outcome of the American economy being made an unattractive destination for investment. (Ross and Navarro seem to be unaware that to ‚Äúeliminate our trade deficit‚Äù ‚Äì such as was done, for example, during the Great Depression ‚Äì is to eliminate net contributions by foreigners to increasing the size of America‚Äôs capital stock.)
But Trump‚Äôs most absurd promise is to enrich Americans by increasing exports and reducing imports. Imports are what we voluntarily buy and exports are the price we pay. Therefore, a policy meant to increase exports while decreasing imports is a policy meant to force Americans to pay more to foreigners and to receive less in return ‚Äì a decidedly unartful deal the architect of which would deserved to be fired.
But the Trump camp‚Äôs confusion runs even more deeply. Exporting for Americans is worthwhile only because it supplies us with the means to purchase imports, either currently or in the future. So a policy that aims both to increase exports and to decrease imports is akin to a policy that aims both to increase people‚Äôs spending power and to decrease it. It‚Äôs a policy meant to give Americans greater means for acquiring imports as it simultaneously strips Americans of the freedom to use those means. It‚Äôs the economic policy equivalent of an attempt to square a circle.

Wall Street Journal: Republicans Rode Waves of Populism Until They Crashed the Party | Politics,"(Before It's News)
This is a good article :
‚ÄúWhen Donald Trump rode down an escalator at Trump Tower to launch his presidential campaign in June 2015, he began galvanizing a populist version of the Republican Party.
But he didn‚Äôt create it.
The GOP that carried Mr. Trump to the presidential nomination was formed by waves of new voters who washed onto Republican shores in the last four decades: George Wallace Southerners, Ronald Reagan Democrats, Pat Buchanan pitchfork populists and tea-party foot soldiers.
The Republican establishment was happy to have the votes of these newcomers, many from America‚Äôs working class, and accommodated their cultural preferences on social issues from guns to abortion to gay marriage. What the establishment didn‚Äôt do was adjust the GOP‚Äôs economic approach to match the populist impulses‚Äîor even seem to consider such a shift necessary. ‚Ä¶‚Äù
Rich Lowry put it well here :
‚ÄúOur basic argument about Trump is simple and unassailable: He is a populist, not a conservative. Conservatism has always had a populist element, but it has been tethered to conservatism‚Äôs animating causes of liberty, limited government and the Constitution. Trump inveighs against elites and tramples on political pieties, but these causes are afterthoughts to him, at best.‚Äù
Ross Douthat put it better here:
‚ÄúSometimes this interdependency has worked out well. At its peaks of political success, the conservative intelligentsia has channeled and directed populism, responding to grass-roots passions without being ruled by them.‚Äù
The goal of the conservative intelligentsia has always been to CUCK the populist vote so that all of its anger and energy can be ‚Äútethered‚Äù or ‚Äúchanneled‚Äù into advancing the conservative agenda (read: classical liberal agenda) of the ‚Äúgoverning wing‚Äù of the Republican Party. The role of populist voters in the GOP is to show up on election day and vote for a handpicked establishment candidate like Mitt Romney or ¬°Jeb!
In this way, the conservatives can pass new free-trade deals for their corporate backers in the US Chamber of Commerce, start massive new destructive, unending wars in the Middle East, and keep the border wide open so that an endless influx of Third World cheap labor can further enrich the plutocracy. They figured all those yokels would just keep voting for them indefinitely because Democrats want to abort babies and seize guns.
Give them lip service! Give them token gestures! Give them round after round of failure theater! You know, it kind of worked too until their whole signaling structure broke down. That‚Äôs what happens when an elite loses its legitimacy. To borrow an analogy, the falcon doesn‚Äôt respond to the Falconer anymore and the elite falls.
It is only a matter of time.",1
Clinton Vs. Trump: Latest Electoral Prediction [Greg Laden's Blog] | Science and Technology,"(Before It's News)
It is fun to look at polls, and using such data, decide which candidate will win which state, and ultimately, which candidate will win the electoral college. A lot of people and organizations do that, and for this reason, I don‚Äôt. I do not have access to polls that no one else sees. Were I to use polling data to directly predict outcomes per state, I‚Äôd use a method like that used by FiveThirtyEight, and probably come up with similar results. How boring. It would be a waste of my time to try to replicate the excellent work done by Nate Silver and his team.
Back during the Democratic Primaries, I decided that I wanted to get a handle on which candidate was likely to win, fairly early on. The polling based estimates were inadequate because most states simply didn‚Äôt have polling data that early in the process. So, I invented an alternative method, which made certain estimates of how voters with different ethnic identities would vote. That method accurately predicted several primary outcomes, outperforming the poll based methods such as those used by FiveThirtyEight.
After a while, enough primaries had been carried out that I could switch methods slightly. Using the same exact model, but primed with the results of prior primaries (that year) rather than my estimates of voter behavior, I used the ethnic distribution data for each state to predict the outcome of upcoming primary contests.
Once again, my method was very accurate, and once again, it out performed the polling based methods.
So, recently, I‚Äôve tried to apply a similar method to estimating the electoral outcome for this year‚Äôs presidential race. But, it is impossible to use the same exact method because the entire thing happens all on one day. I can‚Äôt use the election results from a handful of states to estimate the likely future outcomes in other states.
I recognize that polling data is very limited on a national level. Things happen during an election season that probably change people‚Äôs likely voting behavior, especially among independents. Solid states are rarely polled, and small states, swing or not, are rarely polled. Many polls are of low quality. Right now, for instance, fewer than half of the states have polls that were a) taken fully after the final POTUS debate and b) have an A- or better rating from FiveThirtyEight. If I allow the use of B and occasional C ratings for recent polls, and allow a few polls to include periods of time prior to the last POTUS debate, but only in states that are very strongly in favor of one candidate or the other (and thus likely to not move anyway), I can find 32 states that have sort of usable polling data. Interestingly, states with some of the more controversial changes happening, like Utah and Iowa, are not adequately polled.
In order to apply a model like the one I used in the Primaries to the current election, I used the 32 states for which there was somewhat acceptable recent polling data to inform the model (to calculate the regression coefficients) in order to then, separately, predict the likely voting behavior (Trump vs. Clinton) in all of the states.
Before I show you the map, however, I need to discuss something else.
About a week ago the press, especially the somewhat more left leaning press, and various commenters, seeing much reaction to a series of events beginning with the NYT release of Trump‚Äôs tax return and ending with the final POTUS debate, events which sandwiched the sexual assault tapes and accusations, collectively decided that a huge gap between Clinton and Trump was rapidly opening up and the race would end with a double digit spread, an electoral rout, and a big party.
Soon after, I pointed out that this may not be correct. That polling data seemed to show, rather, that there was an expansion of the difference between the two candidates followed by a re-closing of the gap, with Clinton still leading but by about as much as before this temporary shift. To this I added a concern. If too many people assumed that the race was over and in the double digit range, perhaps there could be a GOTV backlash effect, or a funding effect, that would shift things to within shooting distance for Trump.
I was not alone in thinking this, and I was probably right. The GOP sunk, via pacs, 25 million dollars into Senate races in response to the Democrats shifting from the national race to the Senate, which was followed by the Democrats shifting back to the national race in certain states, presumably recognizing that the polls were artificially spread. Indeed, some who criticized (arguing mainly from incredulity and good wishes) my admonition noted, correctly, that some of that narrowing was because a bunch of right-leaning polls had come out all at once. This is true, but it ignores that a bunch of left-leaning polls had made the formation of the Great Gap of GOP Defeat look a lot bigger than it ever really was.
I say all this as part one of my preparation for what I‚Äôm going to tell you below, which is not the news you want to hear. Part two is some logic I‚Äôd like to bludgeon you with.
Consider these points:
1) True Trump supporters could give a rat‚Äôs ass about sexual assault, poor debate performance, or tax forms. Donald Trump was correct when he said, weeks ago, now forgotten, that he could gun someone down on the streets of Manhattan and he would not lose support form his base. These people did not abandon him when he was heard to talk about sexual assault. If anything, they were energized by it. And, I‚Äôm talking about something just shy of 40% of the voters. We live in a barely civilized asshole country.
2) Please tell me exactly which Hillary Clinton supporters, who were going to vote for Clinton over Trump all along, are NOW going to pick Clinton (if polled or on voting day) that change from not being Clinton supporters to being Clinton supporters? In other words (this is a somewhat subtle point) which people who hated Trump became True Haters of Trump after the sexual assault thing? Almost none. They were already there.
3) The third category of people, the undecideds (who are only lying about being undecided, in most cases) and the so-called ‚Äúreasonable Republicans‚Äù (of which there are very, very few), who could conceivably shift from Trump to Clinton are going to divide their voting activities between Johnson, a write in (as they are being advised by Republican leaders in some cases) or simply staying home.
In other words, over the last few weeks, no source has emerged that hands Secretary Clinton more electoral votes than she probably had about a month ago, and Trump is not going to have any, or at least not many, electoral votes go away.
Those observations (part one) and that logic (part two) cause me to be utterly unsurprised to find out that an analysis of the electoral map I did on October 16th and one I did today do not show Clinton pulling farther ahead. In fact, the two analyses have Clinton being less far ahead than Trump now than ten days ago. The difference is in Ohio (shifting from Clinton to Trump) which is almost certainly going to happen, and North Carolina (which shifted from Clinton to Trump in this analysis) which seems much less likely to happen, and Arizona shifting from Clinton (that was probably wishful thinking) to Trump.
The point here is this, plain and simple. An analysis using a technique that has worked very well for me in the past shows that the difference between that moment of Maximal Clintonosity and today is plus or minus a couple of state. In other words, not different. Maybe a little worse. Really, about the same.
Here‚Äôs the current map:
Obviously, I will be watching for more data over the next few days. I assume there will be a spate of polls as we approach November 8th (the day Democrats vote. Republicans vote on the 28th of November). If so, then there will be convergence between my method of calibration and my method of calculation, and the model will consume itself by the tail and become very accurate at the same time.
But between now and then, perhaps that very small number of polls that are both recent and high quality will grow a bit more and I can do this again and resolve those closer states.
By the way, the ‚Äúswing states‚Äù according to my model, the states where things are close, are Ohio, North Carolina, Arizona, and Georgia of those now in the Trump column. Those are indeed swing states. Numerically, the close states that are in the Clinton column are Virginia, New Hampshire, and Pennsylvania.",1
,"Wisconsin, Michigan and Florida will go to Trump too. Trump will landslide the popular vote. George Soros has already said as much. The only way Shillary wins is by paying off the electoral college at which point we go to war right here at home because there is no way in hell that people will allow that nasty criminal hag to steal the election on top of everything else she has stolen.
You want demographics and statistics? Trump fills football stadiums. Hildebeast can‚Äôt fill a middle school gym. Tim Kaine gave a speech to 30 people in Florida 2 days ago. Those 30 people included the press and secret service.
Loom at twitter followers, instagram subscribers, and facebook likes. More people like the hillary for prison pages than the hillary for president pages.

Why Even Sing? Anthem Singer Kneels During Performance | Alternative,"(Before It's News)

Here‚Äôs How Goldman Sachs Lays People Off | Financial Markets,"(Before It's News) 43 here, 109 there and pretty soon 443 employees are dismissed Bank has to file ‚ÄòWARN notices‚Äô with New York state agency The first ‚Äúplant layoff‚Äù notice came in February: 43 people would lose their jobs.
The second arrived six weeks later, increasing the cuts to 109 workers. Then a third, in April, for 146 more. And a fourth, in June: 98. Three more notices followed, including 20 dismissals announced last week.
The ‚Äúplant‚Äù in question ‚Äî Goldman Sachs Group Inc.
Like all big companies in New York State, the firm is required to file a ‚ÄúWARN notice‚Äù with state authorities when it plans to shed large numbers of employees as part of a plant closing, or ‚Äúmass layoffs‚Äù involving 250 or more. Employers also must inform the state of smaller reductions under certain circumstances, and Goldman Sachs cited a ‚Äúplant layoff‚Äù in each case. Last week‚Äôs notice brings this year‚Äôs job-cut tally to 443.With the run of notices, seven since the start of the year, the bank has signaled its intention to dismiss hundreds of employees in New York without placing a single, headline-grabbing number on the overall reduction, already its largest since 2008. The company‚Äôs approach differs from competitors, including Morgan Stanley, who have shown a preference for larger, one-time cuts.
Big Number
‚ÄúWhen there‚Äôs a big number, people right away get that something is happening at that firm ‚Äî it‚Äôs a negative,‚Äù said Jeanne Branthover, a partner at New York-based executive-search firm DHR International. ‚ÄúThis is more, ‚ÄòWe‚Äôre having layoffs and we don‚Äôt want to explain it.‚Äô It‚Äôs more under the radar screen.‚Äù
The 20 people in the latest reduction were notified either this month or last, according to a person with direct knowledge of the matter, who asked not to be identified discussing staffing decisions. The terminations will take place between Nov. 7 and Jan. 5, according to the notice posted on the state Labor Department‚Äôs website. The workers aren‚Äôt represented by a union.
Gena Palumbo, a managing director and the bank‚Äôs global head of employment law, is the sole Goldman Sachs contact listed on each of this year‚Äôs WARN notices. In 2008, the firm dismissed 900 people in New York in two different sets of cuts as the financial crisis raged. A spokesman for the bank declined to comment.
Goldman Sachs set aside $9.2 billion for compensation and benefits this year through September, 13 percent less than the first nine months of last year. Total employees, including consultants and part-time workers, fell 5.4 percent to 34,900.
While Goldman prefers a scalpel, its rival Morgan Stanley wielded an ax. That firm took steps to shrink in the fourth quarter, cutting 1,200 employees, including about 25 percent of the fixed-income trading staff, or about 470 traders and salesmen. When asked about how Morgan Stanley decided to make the changes, trading chief Ted Pick said he favored a bold move.
‚ÄúWe took the view of taking tough medicine,‚Äù Pick, 47, said in February.
Slower Approach
Goldman Sachs‚Äôs slower approach may reflect a desire to avoid cutting too much if trading or dealmaking comes roaring back. Chief Executive Officer Lloyd Blankfein has spoken about staying nimble to respond to revenue opportunities when they arise.
It also may reflect an outlook that got cloudier as the year progressed. In January, a person familiar with the firm‚Äôs thinking said Goldman Sachs was mulling cuts to more than 5 percent of its fixed-income staff. By March, that would expand to more than 5 percent but less than 10 percent. And by May, 10 percent.
The job cuts continued after first-quarter revenue was the worst for the start of a year in Blankfein‚Äôs decade-long tenure. While trading business bounced back in the second and third quarters, total trading revenue for the first nine months declined 11 percent from last year.
The WARN notices don‚Äôt capture firings outside New York and they don‚Äôt include voluntary retirements. More than a half-dozen partners have left Goldman Sachs this year, according to internal memos obtained by Bloomberg.
‚ÄúEverything Goldman does is scrutinized,‚Äù Branthover said. ‚ÄúThis may be a signal or a sign that there are changes being made internally, or there are businesses and areas that are not performing satisfactorily. I would keep an eye on it.‚Äù",1

"NSA Whistleblower Says DNC Email Hack Was Not by Russia, but by US Intelligence | Alternative","(Before It's News)
An NSA Whistleblower says that Hillary Clinton‚Äôs deleted emails are easily accessible by the NSA and FBI should they desire to look at them, and he suggests that the hacks on the Democratic National Committee‚Äôs server was not done by Russia, as many pundits are claiming, but possibly by a disgruntled U.S. intelligence worker.
William Binney, the architect of the NSA‚Äôs surveillance program, resigned on October 31, 2001, after working for the agency for more than 30 years. He thinks that an intelligence worker may have hacked into the DNC emails due to concern about Hillary Clinton‚Äôs disregard of national security in her use of a personal email server and her continued lies about her activity. Once accessed, there‚Äôs no telling where the information could have gone.
The ‚ÄúPutin did it‚Äù story is a fable used to sway voters towards Clinton‚Äôs war-driven agenda.
On a talk radio show, he mentioned that there are numerous questions that are not being answered about the hacked DNC emails and the network log available to the NSA.
Binney explains that there was no evidence tying the alleged Russian hacks to Wikileaks, and he says that they would have access to this information through the network logs. ‚ÄúSo, if the FBI really wanted them, they can go into that database and get them right now,‚Äù he said.
He finds their reluctance to speak to this matter highly suspicious.

Aetna CEO on Obamacare: Young People Will Choose Beer First | Politics,"(Before It's News)
Remember when the media, Barack Obama, and Democrats were finger-wagging and tut-tutting Republicans for saying Obamacare was going to be a failure? Remember how Obama said premiums were going to go down?
For the last 18 months, Obama and his fellow Democrats have been reduced to bragging about how many people are now ‚Äúcovered‚Äù by health insurance as if it was some real accomplishment. Two points to consider:
It is mandatory. People are merely obeying the law and getting a plan. The law‚Äôs intention was for healthcare coverage to be more affordable, and that has not happened. Insurers are recognizing this problem. Younger people would rather be in a position where they pay the fine (which the administration is not enforcing), rather than the out of pocket costs for a health care plan. The CEO of Aetna said as much:
Healthier people will avoid buying Affordable Care Act health insurance plans as premiums climb, threatening the stability of the market, Aetna Inc. Chief Executive Officer Mark Bertolini said.
‚ÄúAs the rates rise, the healthier people pull out because the out-of-pocket costs aren‚Äôt worth it,‚Äù Bertolini said at Bloomberg‚Äôs The Year Ahead Summit in New York. ‚ÄúYoung people can do the math. Gas for the car, beer on Fridays and Saturdays, health insurance.‚Äù
Premiums for health plans sold to individuals under the ACA, known as Obamacare, are going up by about 25 percent on average for next year. Bertolini said that as costs rise, more individuals will decide not to buy health plans. That‚Äôll push premiums even higher, unless a new president and lawmakers can find fixes for the new markets created by the 2010 health law.
The question over whether such problems get fixed is all dependent upon whether or no the President, be it Obama or Clinton, recognizes what divided government means. It is not to say, as President Obama believes, ‚ÄúHere is what I need, now pass it so I can sign it.‚Äù President Obama or President Clinton must recognize divided government means everything is on the table at the start of negotiations , not just what the President wants.

,"A leading US senator: US Supporting War in Syria
A leading US senator said the war in Syria would have been over by now if the US had put an end to its intervention when Russia entered the war-ravaged country.
‚ÄúIf the United States had just stayed out of it at that point, the war would be over by now; people would be rebuilding, refugees would be returning back to Syria, but the United States rushed anti-Tank missiles, and we used these so-called moderate rebels as a conduit to supply al-Nusra Front (also known as Fatah al-Sham Front), which is al-Qaeda in Syria,‚Äù republican member of the Virginia State in US Senate, Richard Hayden Black said in an exclusive interview with Press TV.
‚ÄúIf we were not supporting the war in Syria, I believe that the Syrians, combined with their allied forces from Iran, Lebanon and Russia‚Ä¶ would move very steadily and restore the borders of Syria.‚Äù
The senate member, who visited Syria in April, refused to distinguish between militants and terrorists fighting the government of President Bashar al-Assad, saying, the two are ‚Äúthoroughly integrated.‚Äù
‚ÄúThey really are one and the same, they‚Äôre part of the same army,‚Äù he said, citing a US defense intelligence agency‚Äôs investigation in 2013, which showed Washington‚Äôs ties with the terror group.
The outspoken state senator referred to plans by the CIA to transfer arms from Libya to Turkey and from there to Syria to supply the militants, noting that the move ‚Äúevolved into an indiscriminate program of supplying all militant groups, including specifically ISIL and al-Qaeda.‚Äù
‚ÄúWe do it indirectly because it‚Äôs unlawful to do it directly,‚Äù he said, adding that the US keeps ‚Äúextremely violent organizations‚Ä¶ off the terrorist watch list because these are the agents that take our weapons and then distribute them to ISIL and al-Qaeda.‚Äù
In response to a question on why Iran and Russia are portrayed as the ‚Äúbad guys,‚Äù while they are the ones really fighting terrorism there, as put recently by GOP presidential candidate Donald Trump, Black said the Republican candidate has a ‚Äúclear understanding of what‚Äôs happening over there.‚Äù
‚ÄúSometimes, his rhetoric has to match the political mood of the moment‚Ä¶ but I know a number of his advisers and they believe that our determination to topple the government in Syria is suicidal, that it threatens not only the entire Middle East but literally the entire world.‚Äù
He further warned that the US itself could be ‚Äúthreatened,‚Äù arguing that, ‚Äúif Syria falls, it will be dominated by some al-Qaeda-related organization; Lebanon will fall; Jordan will fall and the entire area will be destabilized.‚Äù
The Vietnam war veteran also elaborated on his personal definition of the Middle East ‚Äúaxis of evil,‚Äù naming Qatar, Saudi Arabia, and ‚Äúparticularly‚Äù Turkey over their support for terrorism.
‚ÄúProbably, three quarters of the rebels are not Syrian at all, they are mercenaries recruited by Turkey, Qatar and Saudi Arabia,‚Äù he asserted, describing the three countries as ‚Äúthe primary force behind the terrorist movement.‚Äù
‚ÄúTurkey has invaded Iraq and Syria with heavy military forces. Turkey has really become a rogue nation,‚Äù he added, referring to a 1923 treaty that set the border between Turkey and Greece, saying that was even being questioned by President Rececp Tayyip Erdogan.
‚ÄúAnd now you see this emerging threat against Western Europe by Turkey,‚Äù he noted, further adding that Erdogan ‚Äúhas made it clear that he looks to resurrection of the Ottoman Empire.‚Äù
‚ÄúHe has become more and more aggressive; he‚Äôs crushed the military, the free press; every powerful institution of the Turkish government has come under his iron fist and he‚Äôs now a total dictator. He‚Äôs a man who has said that he wants the constitution amended so that he will have power similar to those of Adolf Hilter‚Ä¶ This is our great ally; we‚Äôre allied with a man who would be Hitler.‚Äù
He also blasted Washington‚Äôs alliance with Saudi Arabia, ‚Äúwhere women are not allowed to walk out in the front yard to pick up the newspaper without a man‚Äôs permission; they can‚Äôt drive a car!‚Äù
‚ÄúSomehow, this is part of the liberalization that we seek to impose on the Middle East,‚Äù he said ironically, calling it ‚Äúbizarre.‚Äù
He also praised the resistance against the Saudi aggression by the people of Yemen, saying, ‚ÄúGod bless them! The Yemenis are giving the Saudis a bloody nose,‚Äù despite being a ‚Äútiny little, poor nation.‚Äù
‚ÄúI think the world recognizes that Saudi Arabia has just embarked in massive war crimes in Yemen,‚Äù he said, voicing regret over the US support for the monarchy.
‚ÄúWe don‚Äôt pay too much attention to them while engaged in war crimes because they‚Äôre our good allies,‚Äù he said, concluding that Washington is on a ‚Äúsuicidal course of action.‚Äù
‚ÄúSaudi money pays the very top politicians in many Western nations. And they really have co-opted the American military into acting as mercenaries for Wahhabism.‚ÄùBlack referred to the Western media‚Äôs portrayal of Iran as a supporter of terrorism, saying, ‚ÄúThe fact of the matter is that if you really look at global terrorism, it all emanates from Saudi Arabia.‚Äù
He exemplified various terrorists attack, including the 9/11, the Boston bombing, and the Brussels attacks, noting that they are all a ‚Äúreflection of the Wahhabi philosophy.‚Äù",1
Yellowstone Visitors Use Bear Spray to Deter Bear Encounter | Outdoors,"(Before It's News)
News and Adventure from Glacier National Park
After surprising and then being charged by a grizzly bear, a couple fishing along the Lamar River effectively deployed their bear spray and saved themselves from injury on Saturday, October 22.
John and Lisa Vandenbos from Bozeman, MT, parked at a pullout near the Specimen Ridge trailhead in the Lamar Valley, east of Tower Junction. They walked cross-country to the Lamar River and, while scouting for fishing spots, surprised an adult grizzly bear who was feeding on a partially consumed carcass. The bear immediately charged the couple and came within nine feet when both individuals quickly discharged their bear spray.
The bear initially left. When attempting to charge the couple again, it ran into the original cloud of bear spray. Upon making contact with the cloud, the bear retreated all the way back across the river and up the adjacent hillside ‚Äúas fast as it could go‚Äù. The couple did not sustain injuries and bear spray stopped the charging bear.
The couple left the area immediately and returned to their vehicle. They then reported the incident to a park ranger. Park rangers do not intend to search for the bear since this incident was a surprise encounter with a bear defending its carcass.
All of Yellowstone National Park is bear country. Reduce your risk of a bear encounter by carrying bear spray. Studies show that bear spray is more than 90 percent effective in stopping an aggressive bear. In fact, it is the most effective deterrent when used in combination with regular safety recommendations ‚Äì be alert, make noise, hike in groups of three or more, do not run if you encounter a bear and stand your ground if charged by a bear.
‚ÄúYellowstone visitors care deeply about preserving bears and observing them in the wild,‚Äù says Kerry Gunther, the park‚Äôs Bear Management Specialist. ‚ÄúCarrying bear spray is the best way for visitors to participate in bear conservation because reducing potential conflicts protects both people and bears.‚Äù
Help the park increase the number of visitors who carry bear spray and know how to use it. Visit A Bear Doesn‚Äôt Care Campaign for more information.

It is Time for Hillary Clinton to Duck and Go (Video) | Alternative,"(Before It's News)
(image credit: Justin Sullivan / Getty)
( The Real Agenda News ) More details have emerged about the never ending levels of corruption among the DNC, the Obama White House and the Hillary Clinton campaign, as a result of James O‚ÄôKeefe‚Äôs Project Veritas‚Äô investigation.
Corrupt practices go from promoting seemingly harmless campaigns to have people dressed as ducks at Trump rallies to collusion between the Clinton campaign, the DNC and the non-profit organization Americans United for Change.
In the third video put out by Project Veritas, Hillary‚Äôs cohorts confess how they managed to coordinate with her campaign and the DNC to set up what can be described at the very least as provocative moves to get the Trump campaign in trouble and to have the corrupt mainstream media cover the events while blaming Trump for violent outbursts outside his rallies.
As we learned from the previous two videos, it was the Clinton campaign itself the one using agent provocateurs to cause violence outside Trump rallies as these agents disguised themselves as Bernie Sanders‚Äô followers.
In his second video, James O‚ÄôKeefe showed how the DNC and the Hillary Clinton campaign, hire operatives to successfully carry out commit voter fraud on a massive scale.
Scott Foval, who has since been fired, admits that the Democrats have been rigging elections for fifty years.
In his first video, Rigging the Election ‚Äì Video I: Clinton Campaign and DNC Incite Violence at Trump Rallies, O‚ÄôKeefe showed how second and third parties associated with the Democratic Party and the Clinton campaign, were responsible for violence and attacks on Trump supporters all over the country.
As we said before, the veil of corruption that surrounds the Clinton campaign and the Democratic Party continues to fall and people can easily see what is behind their fake progressive and fake liberal masks.

A prominent Iraqi military analyst disclosed that Riyadh and Ankara had hatched plots to transfer ISIL leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi from Mosul to Libya but the massive presence of the popular forces and Russian fighter jets at the bordering areas of Iraq and Syria dissuaded them.

‚ÄúHashd al-Sha‚Äôabi will soon start its operations in Western Mosul to cut the ISIL‚Äôs supply routes to Syria and defuse the US plots to postpone the popular forces‚Äô participation in the Mosul operations, and General Soleimani has also joined them as a military advisor,‚Äù the Arabic-language al-Akhbar said quoting renowned Iraqi figures.
No other source has yet confirmed the report.
Washington is pressuring Iraqi Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi not to allow Hashd al-Sha‚Äôabi forces to participate in the Mosul liberation operations.
Spokesman of the Iraqi popular forces Ahmad al-Assadi had confirmed in August that General Soleimani would play a major role in operations to liberate Mosul, stressing that his country is in dire need of Iranian military advisors.
‚ÄúThe presence of Brigadier-General Soleimani in the operations to free Mosul and Nineveh province is necessary and General Soleiman is the greatest advisor that has helped the Iraqi government in the war against the ISIL,‚Äù al-Assadi told FNA.

In relevant remarks in June, Iraqi Foreign Minister Ebrahim al-Jafari underlined that General Soleimani is in Iraq to help the country in campaign against terrorism after receiving Baghdad‚Äôs rigid request.

He, meantime, said that the Iraqi nation is able to kick the terrorists out of Iraq with the possibilities in their hands now, adding that Hashd al-Sha‚Äôabi doesn‚Äôt have any political plan and merely supports the political process.

Appellate Court Overturns Five-Year Durational Limit for Historic Mim‚Äôs Restaurant‚Äôs Parking Lot | The Law,"(Before It's News)
UNIONDALE, NEW YORK ‚Äî Sahn Ward Coschignano, PLLC has announced that Christian Browne, a Partner with the Firm, successfully appealed a New York State Supreme Court decision that dismissed a restaurant‚Äôs request to annul a five-year durational limit on the eatery‚Äôs parking lot that extends into the Town‚Äôs Residence District.
On April 22, 2015, the Board of Zoning and Appeals (BZA) imposed a five-year durational limit on an approval that allows Mim‚Äôs Restaurant to provide parking in a part of its property that is within a residential zoning district.
The restaurant then commenced an Article 78 proceeding, seeking to annul the durational limit. On November 18, 2015, the New York State Supreme Court, Nassau County, denied the petition and dismissed the proceeding.
On October 19, 2016, the Supreme Court of the State of New York, Appellate Division, Second Judicial Department, overturned the lower court‚Äôs decision. In its ruling, the Appellate Court stated that the BZA does not have the authority to impose the durational limit on the restaurant‚Äôs parking lot because the Town Code does not confer any such power to limit the life of the approval.
Zoning boards routinely impose durational limits on various types of approvals given for commercial uses. Businesses often object to these time restrictions as being unfair and unnecessary burdens on their property rights because, by limiting the life of a zoning approval, zoning boards force businesses to regularly seek renewed permission for their ongoing operations.
‚ÄúWe are pleased with the Court‚Äôs decision,‚Äù Mr. Browne said. ‚ÄúWe believe it strikes the proper balance between the rights of a commercial property owner and the need for the Town to protect the interest of the surrounding neighborhood.‚Äù
Nicholas J. Cappadora, an Associate with the Firm, assisted Mr. Browne on the case.

More on why you believe what you believe: Sugar | Economics and Politics,"(Before It's News)
Twitter: @rodgermitchell; Search #monetarysovereignty
Facebook: Rodger Malcolm Mitchell
In a recent post, ‚ÄúWhy do you believe what you believe‚Äù we said:
‚ÄúWhy do you know the sun causes skin cancer? You know it because years ago you read it in, or heard it from, a trusted source . Then you read and heard it often again, and the repetition caused you to believe it more and more until you know it.
The combination of ‚Äútrusted source‚Äù and ‚Äúrepetition‚Äù inserts belief into our minds , and once there, it may be difficult to dislodge ‚Äî unless we are exposed to a more trusted source plus repetition.
As you know, consuming saturated fat and cholesterol increases your risk of heart disease, while sugar does not. You have heard this from many trusted sources and it has been repeated endlessly in all forms of communication.
ScienceNews Magazine, October 15, 2016, Sugar industry sought to sugarcoat causes of heart disease
Payments revealed to authors of influential 1967 report touting fat and cholesterol as problems, by LAURA BEIL
Using records unearthed from library storage vaults, researchers recently revealed that the sugar industry paid nutrition experts from Harvard University to downplay studies linking sugar and heart disease.
Although the incident happened in the 1960s, it appears to have helped redirect the scientific narrative for decades.
Harvard University ‚Äî what could be a more trusted source than Harvard University?
Note however, that Harvard University does not conduct research, nor does Harvard University verify the findings of research.
Research is done by people, employees of Harvard , and being employees of Harvard gives those researchers no special insight or virtue.
Yet the mere association with the name ‚ÄúHarvard,‚Äù implies intelligence and academic trustworthiness.
The documents show that the Sugar Research Foundation paid professors who wrote a two-part review in 1967 in the New England Journal of Medicine . That report was highly skeptical of the evidence linking sugar to cardiovascular problems but accepting of the role of fat.
The now-deceased professors‚Äô overall conclusion left ‚Äúno doubt‚Äù that reducing the risk of heart disease was a matter of reducing saturated fat and cholesterol, according to researchers from the University of California, San Francisco, who published their report online September 12 in JAMA Internal Medicine .
Now, we have the University of California, San Francisco, another trusted source, impugning the trusted Harvard results.
The sugar industry helped deflect the way the research was developing,‚Äù says study coauthor Cristin Kearns, a dentist at UCSF‚Äôs Institute for Health Policy Studies.
The belief in sugar‚Äôs innocence, and the sugar industry‚Äôs profit motive, were so powerful, it took a dentist, not a cardiologist to uncover apparently biased results from what ostensibly was a heart study.
Following the publication of the Harvard report, fat and cholesterol went on to hijack the scientific agenda for decades, and even led to a craze of low-fat foods that often added sugar.
It was only in 2015 that dietary guidelines finally made a strong statement to limit sugar. Researchers writing this year in Progress in Cardiovascular Diseases note that current studies estimate that diets high in added sugars carry a three times higher risk of death from cardiovascular disease.
( The Sugar Association says in a statement on its website that ‚Äú the last several decades of research have concluded that sugar does not have a unique role in heart disease. ‚Äù )
Is this an example of deception with a true statement ?
Yes, unfortunately, the last several decades of research did absolve sugar from blame, and what does ‚Äúunique role in heart disease‚Äù really mean? If sugar causes heart disease, is that a ‚Äúunique role‚Äù?
The Sugar Association‚Äôs statement acknowledged the secret deal occurred, but pointed out that ‚Äúwhen the studies in question were published, funding disclosures and transparency standards were not the norm they are today.‚Äù
Translation: The research lied, but back then, we didn‚Äôt have to reveal the lie. So, it‚Äôs O.K.
Journals now require all authors to list conflicts of interest, especially funding from a source has a vested interest in the outcome.
While a modern researcher could not take corporate money, even for speaking fees, without disclosure, the influences may be more subtle, he says. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre not talking about making up data, but perhaps influencing how a research question is framed.‚Äù
Revealing the source of funding doesn‚Äôt eliminate bias. And, though one reasonably may conclude that a high percentage of private funding comes from sources with an ax to grind, that doesn‚Äôt necessarily mean the research results are misleading.
But, such funding leads to the question: ‚ÄúWhat happens to results that disagree with the benefactor‚Äôs purpose?
If several, slightly different pieces of research show that sugar has an adverse effect on heart health, and one shows it doesn‚Äôt, what happens to all the negative research?
Andy Bellatti, cofounder and strategic director of Dietitians for Professional Integrity says that researchers don‚Äôt necessarily want to be cozy with industry, but sometimes turn to commercial sources because non-biased research money is lacking .
‚ÄúThe reason the food industry is able to do this is because there is such little public funding for nutrition and disease.‚Äù
Here is yet another example, among hundreds, of how cuts in federal deficit spending hurt America , though often benefitting big business.
And what does the need for an organization titled, ‚Äú Dietitians for Professional Integrity‚Äù tell you about today‚Äôs food research?
The scientific community should not reject industry money wholesale, says John Sievenpiper, a physician and nutrition researcher at the University of Toronto.
He believes that any scientist who takes industry money should adhere to an even higher standard of openness, including releasing study protocols ahead of time so reviewers can make sure the research question was not changed midstream to favor a certain conclusion.
Bottom line:
For many years, your belief in ‚Äúbenign sugar‚Äù was created by ‚Äútrusted sources‚Äù and repetition. As with privately owned banks , the profit motive encourages unethical behavior. Corporations do not fund research out of generosity. They consider research to be part of their marketing efforts. Negative results often are twisted or hidden. Researchers, whether employed by Harvard University, the University of California, a private organization, or working alone, all can be swayed , consciously or not, to tilt their interpretations in favor of the money supply. Cuts in federally funded Research & Development grants are misguided if the primary purpose is to ‚Äúsave the federal government money‚Äù or to ‚Äúmake government smaller‚Äù (a huge, often unacknowledged disadvantage of libertarianism). While the federal government has political motives, it does not have a profit motive , and that alone helps make it a more trusted source for food & drug research than is private industry.

Breaking: Ivanka Trump Makes Tragic Announcement Both Donald Trump and Supporters Are Shocked (Video) | Prophecy,"(Before It's News)
Ivanka Trump is going to have to back off from her father‚Äôs campaign, because the hateful and sexist rhetoric of Donald Trump is severely hurting Ivanka‚Äôs clothing and lifestyle brand.
Women are turning on Ivanka Trump as she continues supporting her father despite allegations of sexual harassment against him and a 2005 audio tape capturing him bragging in lewd terms that he can do whatever he wants to women.
Now, the growing group of women are boycotting her line of clothing, jewelry, perfume and accessories sold as part of the Ivanka Trump Collection. They are also calling on the stores that carry the brand, including Nordstrom, Bloomingdale‚Äôs and Macy‚Äôs, to stop selling it.
It has even created its own hashtag, #Ivankant, as well as #GrabYourWallet.
From The Daily Mail :
‚ÄòIf Ivanka Trump had distanced herself from the campaign I would not be boycotting her,‚Äô Shannon Coulter, who called on Americans to boycott the brand earlier this month, told the Guardian.
‚ÄòBut something changed for me when that tape was released.‚Äô
Coulter, who shared her own experience of sexual harassment at the hands of a male superior, launched the hashtag ‚ÄòGrabYourWallet‚Äô on October 11, a reference to Trump‚Äôs offensive ‚Äògrab them by the p***y‚Äô remark from the audio tape.
The problem obviously for Ivanka, is that Donald Trump‚Äôs base, for the most part, doesn‚Äôt shop at Bloomingdale‚Äôs or Nordstrom, which are two of the largest stores that carry her clothing line, along with Macy‚Äôs.
What are your thoughts, should Ivanka‚Äôs business be hurt because of the actions of her father?
From Politico:
The New York Times cited a deposition from a woman who claimed that Donald Trump groped her under the table decades ago, but the presumptive Republican presidential nominee is certainly not a groper, his daughter said Wednesday.
‚ÄúLook, I‚Äôm not in every interaction my father has, but he‚Äôs not a groper,‚Äù Ivanka Trump said in an interview broadcast Wednesday on ‚ÄúCBS This Morning.‚Äù ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not who he is. And I‚Äôve known my father obviously my whole life and he has total respect for women.‚Äù
The billionaire businessman launched a Twitter salvo the ‚Äúfailing‚Äù newspaper for its ‚Äúfalse, malicious & libelous story,‚Äù catapulting the story to become the newspaper‚Äôs most popular of the year, according to assistant news editor Theodore Kim.
‚Äî
Ivanka Trump said she read the Sunday cover story and ‚Äúfound it to be pretty disturbing, based on the facts as I know them, and obviously I very much know them‚Äù as a daughter and an executive who‚Äôs worked alongside him for more than a decade.
‚ÄúI was bothered by it, but it‚Äôs largely been discredited since,‚Äù she said, referring to Brewer Lane‚Äôs criticism of the report. Brewer Lane, the ex-girlfriend whose first run-in with Donald Trump was used as the lead anecdote for the article, titled ‚ÄúCrossing the Line: How Donald Trump Behaved With Women in Private,‚Äù accused the newspaper of putting a negative connotation on her words.
‚ÄúMost of the time when stories are inaccurate they‚Äôre not discredited, and I will be frustrated by that, but in this case I think they went so far,‚Äù Ivanka Trump continued. ‚ÄúThey had such a strong thesis and created facts to reinforce it and, you know, I think that narrative has been playing out now and there‚Äôs backlash in that regard.‚Äù

,"A leading US senator: US Supporting War in Syria
A leading US senator said the war in Syria would have been over by now if the US had put an end to its intervention when Russia entered the war-ravaged country.
‚ÄúIf the United States had just stayed out of it at that point, the war would be over by now; people would be rebuilding, refugees would be returning back to Syria, but the United States rushed anti-Tank missiles, and we used these so-called moderate rebels as a conduit to supply al-Nusra Front (also known as Fatah al-Sham Front), which is al-Qaeda in Syria,‚Äù republican member of the Virginia State in US Senate, Richard Hayden Black said in an exclusive interview with Press TV.
‚ÄúIf we were not supporting the war in Syria, I believe that the Syrians, combined with their allied forces from Iran, Lebanon and Russia‚Ä¶ would move very steadily and restore the borders of Syria.‚Äù
The senate member, who visited Syria in April, refused to distinguish between militants and terrorists fighting the government of President Bashar al-Assad, saying, the two are ‚Äúthoroughly integrated.‚Äù
‚ÄúThey really are one and the same, they‚Äôre part of the same army,‚Äù he said, citing a US defense intelligence agency‚Äôs investigation in 2013, which showed Washington‚Äôs ties with the terror group.
The outspoken state senator referred to plans by the CIA to transfer arms from Libya to Turkey and from there to Syria to supply the militants, noting that the move ‚Äúevolved into an indiscriminate program of supplying all militant groups, including specifically ISIL and al-Qaeda.‚Äù
‚ÄúWe do it indirectly because it‚Äôs unlawful to do it directly,‚Äù he said, adding that the US keeps ‚Äúextremely violent organizations‚Ä¶ off the terrorist watch list because these are the agents that take our weapons and then distribute them to ISIL and al-Qaeda.‚Äù
In response to a question on why Iran and Russia are portrayed as the ‚Äúbad guys,‚Äù while they are the ones really fighting terrorism there, as put recently by GOP presidential candidate Donald Trump, Black said the Republican candidate has a ‚Äúclear understanding of what‚Äôs happening over there.‚Äù
‚ÄúSometimes, his rhetoric has to match the political mood of the moment‚Ä¶ but I know a number of his advisers and they believe that our determination to topple the government in Syria is suicidal, that it threatens not only the entire Middle East but literally the entire world.‚Äù
He further warned that the US itself could be ‚Äúthreatened,‚Äù arguing that, ‚Äúif Syria falls, it will be dominated by some al-Qaeda-related organization; Lebanon will fall; Jordan will fall and the entire area will be destabilized.‚Äù
The Vietnam war veteran also elaborated on his personal definition of the Middle East ‚Äúaxis of evil,‚Äù naming Qatar, Saudi Arabia, and ‚Äúparticularly‚Äù Turkey over their support for terrorism.
‚ÄúProbably, three quarters of the rebels are not Syrian at all, they are mercenaries recruited by Turkey, Qatar and Saudi Arabia,‚Äù he asserted, describing the three countries as ‚Äúthe primary force behind the terrorist movement.‚Äù
‚ÄúTurkey has invaded Iraq and Syria with heavy military forces. Turkey has really become a rogue nation,‚Äù he added, referring to a 1923 treaty that set the border between Turkey and Greece, saying that was even being questioned by President Rececp Tayyip Erdogan.
‚ÄúAnd now you see this emerging threat against Western Europe by Turkey,‚Äù he noted, further adding that Erdogan ‚Äúhas made it clear that he looks to resurrection of the Ottoman Empire.‚Äù
‚ÄúHe has become more and more aggressive; he‚Äôs crushed the military, the free press; every powerful institution of the Turkish government has come under his iron fist and he‚Äôs now a total dictator. He‚Äôs a man who has said that he wants the constitution amended so that he will have power similar to those of Adolf Hilter‚Ä¶ This is our great ally; we‚Äôre allied with a man who would be Hitler.‚Äù
He also blasted Washington‚Äôs alliance with Saudi Arabia, ‚Äúwhere women are not allowed to walk out in the front yard to pick up the newspaper without a man‚Äôs permission; they can‚Äôt drive a car!‚Äù
‚ÄúSomehow, this is part of the liberalization that we seek to impose on the Middle East,‚Äù he said ironically, calling it ‚Äúbizarre.‚Äù
He also praised the resistance against the Saudi aggression by the people of Yemen, saying, ‚ÄúGod bless them! The Yemenis are giving the Saudis a bloody nose,‚Äù despite being a ‚Äútiny little, poor nation.‚Äù
‚ÄúI think the world recognizes that Saudi Arabia has just embarked in massive war crimes in Yemen,‚Äù he said, voicing regret over the US support for the monarchy.
‚ÄúWe don‚Äôt pay too much attention to them while engaged in war crimes because they‚Äôre our good allies,‚Äù he said, concluding that Washington is on a ‚Äúsuicidal course of action.‚Äù
‚ÄúSaudi money pays the very top politicians in many Western nations. And they really have co-opted the American military into acting as mercenaries for Wahhabism.‚ÄùBlack referred to the Western media‚Äôs portrayal of Iran as a supporter of terrorism, saying, ‚ÄúThe fact of the matter is that if you really look at global terrorism, it all emanates from Saudi Arabia.‚Äù
He exemplified various terrorists attack, including the 9/11, the Boston bombing, and the Brussels attacks, noting that they are all a ‚Äúreflection of the Wahhabi philosophy.‚Äù",1

The smoke screens are in place and you believe mainstream media, and don‚Äôt have a clue what is going on behind the scenes. If with forged votes, Hilary manages to win the election, we might have a little more time to act like there is nothing wrong with the country. But that too will be a smoke screen and a lie. You know truth matters, obeying laws matter. I dare you and your Hilary supporters to dig deep, and I guarantee you will find that so much evil is being planned and set up by the present establishment. If you read the Executive Orders signed by Obama you will realize He doesn‚Äôt plan to leave office. He plans to cause a situation, either by knocking down the propped up economy, which will leave millions without food, a government provided income, and will cause rioting like we have never seen before in America since a full 50% of people in America are supported by the government in some way. all he will have to do is declare Marsjhall Law then and his Executive Orders become the Rule of Law. Social Security and Medicare have been given to illegal immigrants , and taken from the people who worked hard all their lives and paid into the system to be assured of an income and medical care in old age. They will lose their income too, grandma is not only under the bus, but they keep running over her again and again as they kill people off with refusal to treat people for cancers if they have ever had a heart attack or do life saving surgeries. People 60 to 70 will have to prove their worth to the State to get life saving medical care. Age 70 up will simply be given pills to be in less pain and told to die quietly for the good of the state. For the last 30 years a recently declassified weather Weapon called H.A.A.R.P. has been shooting magnetic pulses up into the stratosphere altering wind patterns. The vapor trails in the sky, people have been told are to slow down global warming due to green house gasses. It is the wind pattern change that is causing every symptom of global warming, and is being done by the World Elite to wipe out the majority of our food supply, by severe droughts in the California, that provides 1/3rd of the fruits and vegetables in the world, The floods in the mid west make growing grain almost impossible, the Mega Storms and floods in the East and and Tornado alley are destroying people homes, their businesses, their lives. Hurricane Matthew as was Sandy were generated by that weather weapon bringing 3 storms together by seeding he storms with microscopic heavy metals, and using that electromagnet to move them together to form one big storm. The electromagnets have some more effects that are even more destructive. They are causing the tectonic plates around North America to move 5 times faster than anywhere else in the world. Sorry Leonard Decaprio should stick to acting, and let real scientists expose the coming tragedy if we do not stop that machine soon. Actually with what has been set in motion, it may already be too late to fix what H.A.A.R.P. has changed. Between the flooding on fault lines and the movement of the tectonic plates, we are having increasing earthquake activity, stronger and closer together. Yellowstone is constantly getting small quakes daily, and more signs of volcanic activity, even the buffalo don‚Äôt want to stay there. And Some other scientists have realized that the magnetic pulses in the stratosphere are causing the natural protection we had from most meteors is missing in some areas and instead we are about to become a magnet for iron based meteorites .
So you know what, it isn‚Äôt going to matter a flip if you don‚Äôt buy Ivanka Trumps clothes and boycott the stores if they don‚Äôt remove them. You will be fortunate indeed if you have food to eat, and haven‚Äôt lost your home to one of many possibilities all caused by the Elite, the CIA, and our elite puppet president, while he smiles real big and thinks how stupid we are. He hasn‚Äôt even tried to pretend anymore. In a speech he promised if Trump won, he had a legal plan to keep him from taking control. And if you think he will care how many young white girls die, think again. Since his executive orders give him total control over all food, water, housing, businesses and people. All he will have to say is, ‚ÄúThe state has need of this‚Äù and he can take it. He can also arrest anyone for suspicion of speaking against the government and hold them without any charges indefinitely thanks to part of a the huge national Defense Act that passed that no one read but voted in‚Ä¶ That bill is like Hitler‚Äôs enabling act that let him arrest everyone of note in any political party that stood against him. In 1933 Hitler arrested 200,000 legal German citizens who were leaders in political parties, most died in the first Concentration Camps he ever built, or rather had his slave labor build. We have camps just like those, with guard towers, and barbed wire facing in, not to keep bad people out , but top keep good people in. Of course most of America won‚Äôt take it lying down, so civil war will break out. I could probably tell you things for hours that have been going on, planned for decades culminating in a one world government, with over half the worlds population dead and gone, because the Elite who call us the eaters, can‚Äôt control too many of us. They want to outlaw private property ownership, and own it all themselves and basically take us back to the Dark Ages and use whoever is still alive as Serfs or slaves. I am telling you not what I think, but what I know. What I have researched, and what has been confirmed to me by two Congressmen, several scientists, and a few chasers‚Ä¶Chasers are real people who go wherever they have to go to get to the truth. One friend chased a train for 200 miles trying to take pictures of the changes one of the Bush Presidents paid to have refitted with triple to quadruple decked metal bunks with hand cuffs attached to the wall‚Ä¶a step up in comfort from Hitlers cattle cars.

Obvious political double standards
When it comes to scandal-plagued and utterly dishonest Hillary Clinton, the U.S. Attorney General Loretta Lynch clandestinely meets on the tarmac of Sky Harbor airport for a t√™te-√†-t√™te with Hill‚Äôs husband Bill aboard a private jet ‚Äî ostensibly to discuss grandchildren.
And, though FBI Director James Comey found compelling evidence of concerning issues in Hillary Clinton‚Äôs use of multiple private email servers, he concluded that he would not recommend charges against her, though he conceded Clinton and her aides were ‚Äúextremely careless‚Äù in handling classified information. Comey refused to recommend an indictment against Hillary Clinton, despite ‚Äúevidence‚Äù she violated laws pertaining to the handling of classified information, jeopardizing U.S. national security. These breaches occurred during her term as Secretary of State. ‚ÄúThere is evidence to support a conclusion that any reasonable person in Secretary Clinton‚Äôs position should have known that an unclassified system was no place for that information,‚Äù Comey acknowledged.
Additionally, Comey noted that other individuals in a similar situation would not necessarily be let off the hook with no charges, and would probably face penalties. ‚ÄúBut that‚Äôs not what we‚Äôre deciding now,‚Äù he glibly fed us, the sheeple. ‚ÄúWe are expressing to Justice our view that no charges be made in this case.‚Äù
‚ÄúJustice,‚Äù of course, is U.S. Attorney General Loretta Lynch of the tarmac meeting fame. Addressing the people of the United States, the FBI director actually said that ‚Äúno outside influence of any kind was brought to bear‚Äù on the investigation. He neglected to mention the inappropriate meeting between former president Bill Clinton and Loretta Lynch aboard a private jet.
Hillary Clinton is free to run for the U.S. Presidency, guaranteeing Obama‚Äôs third term.
Here in Arizona, we have what clearly appears to be a personal vendetta carried out by a federal judge timed to coincide with the General Election in which popular Sheriff Joe Arpaio is on the ballot running for a seventh term.

CEI v. The Attorney General of New York | Libertarian,"(Before It's News)
New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman's office denied CEI‚Äôs May 5, 2016 request for any Common Interest Agreements, which was made under New York‚Äôs Freedom of Information Law (FOIL). His office claimed the records are exempt from disclosure.
CEI is seeking all Common Interest Agreements entered into by the Office of the Attorney General and which are signed by, mention or otherwise include the AGs for other states or territories, as well as certain environmental activists. CEI suspects that these agreements may be a pretext for simply shielding documents from public disclosure.
After supplying a Common Interest Agreement to CEI, AG Schneiderman moved to dismiss our FOIL case against his office. Our October 26, 2016 filing opposes that motion to dismiss on the grounds that there could be more relevant documents yet to be produced, and we also want the common interest agreement ruled invalid, so that it stops functioning as a shield against disclosure of information by AGs.

The Winter of Our Discontent: Survival | Survival,"(Before It's News)
A new year coming up, a new administration being sworn in, and new threats emerging, so will this be a winter like no other? Ice storms, power outages, mass shootings, financial crisis‚Äôs, possible attacks by other countries and civil unrest all loom large in the new year.
The nation‚Äôs power grids, yes plural because there are three of them are in disrepair, and much of the grid system relies entirely on computer systems, which it seems, are hacked on a daily basis. Russia is stirring and making war noises, North Korea has failed to launch but they keep trying and they will get it right soon enough, and then there is Iran running their fingernails down the chalkboard trying to get our attention. Iran wants a war because it takes the focus off of just how badly treated their people are and it always ends up being about money and power, so why not start a war is their thinking.
All in the name of something are wars started, wars are profitable, and they cover up a lot of atrocities committed by all parties, the fog of war, and all that. This winter we may or may not be in a war much may depend on just how the new administration handles things, however.
You cast your vote and pray for the best, of course, there is much more you must do. You as an individual and as a family or even as a community must prepare, because you may have to go it alone for days, weeks, or even months if the grid is hacked and shut down, or if we are attacked or if a natural disaster strikes. The world is in turmoil and much of what happens is simply out of your control, what you can control, however, is how you prepare and react.
You have to be prepared to live without your local, state or federal governments help. No garbage pickup, no clean water piped in, no natural gas for heat or cooking, and no snowplows patrolling the streets. Police will prioritize so that recent break-in with no injuries goes to the bottom of the list. Firefighters may be responding to fires set by violent protesters and ambulance services may have to respond to a mass shooting or injuries caused by rioting. You, the average citizen may very well be on your own, on your own in the dark in some cases for a very long time, in the winter of our discontent.
The weather will have an influence on you, and it must be dealt with along with the other threats looming. It may be time that you grocery shop for two weeks instead of stopping every night or every other night to grab something quick. This way you stand a good chance of having a week to a 10-day supply of food on hand for emergencies.
We generally recommend several months, and in some cases, several years‚Äô worth of food, but the prepping landscape is changing, and finances are the biggest factor. For most Americans, it is not realistic to have a 6-month supply of food on hand, and with that being the case, you will have to adjust your shopping habits and meal preparation habits, so you do have some food reserves on hand at all times. It may not be much but it may be enough to get past many local disasters. If you can afford to have a 6-month supply on hand do so, but for many this is financially out of reach.
The problem with stockpiling food, however, is that it will need to be prepared and many today simply do not have the time or skills to properly prepare a meal, but during a crisis is not the time to try and learn to cook.
There is more to being prepared than having a spare bedroom filled with dehydrated foods, lanterns, batteries, tents, and sleeping bags. You also need skills, such as cooking, fire starting, how to stay warm outside when the wind chill factor is well below zero and how to prepare fresh foods like wild game or fish, for example, without making the family sick.
We have written dozens of articles about the skills needed, and it is well worth your time to review a few. This article is more about reminding you that regardless of what may be going on in the world, the biggest threat to you is usually local. Snow storms, local power outages, broken water mains, which means no clean water unless you boil it, or you lose a few days of work because of a snowstorm, or you experience icy road conditions and end up in the ditch or down a ravine. Local threats and national and world threats all have to be dealt with, but you start with the most likely at the time.
The Simplest Of Things Matter The Most
Keep your vehicle fueled up can save your life. If you run off into the ditch almost on empty, you can‚Äôt stay warm. You need a winter survival kit as well. Warm clothing and shoes for walking in snow and wet conditions, blankets and food and water protected from freezing. You don‚Äôt have to run out and buy emergency blankets, use one or two from the house and toss a spare jacket in the back and those old snow boots you never wear around the house. The simple things matter.
Buy a box of protein bars , and a case of water. For less than 12 bucks, you have water and food for a few days. Toss in some matches, a flashlight, gloves, a small shovel and hat and you are almost there without breaking the bank. You know what you need, it is just a matter of taking the time to do it, and if you look around the house you will find you may not have to run out and buy anything because you already have what you need.
You, of course, have to focus on the big picture as well, the threats from abroad, nuclear war, armed invasions and a major grid collapse but it is likely you will meet a snowstorm or icy roads before the other threats manifest themselves. Of course, we never know for sure, but life is always about the most likely and what is the most realist way of living your life day-to-day.

Hillary Clinton appeared yesterday on El Gordo y la Flaca, a Univision TV show. I would never ask my loyal readers to watch these videos in their entirety.

15 Foods That Contain the Most Vitamin E | Alternative,"(Before It's News)
What is Vitamin E? Vitamin E is an important fat-soluble antioxidant compound that aids the body in neutralizing the harmful after-effects of oxidation of fats. Current research is even looking into the important role that this vitamin plays in stopping free-radical production, a key method of preventing the development of chronic diseases and aging. It is also a vital element in the overall maintenance of a healthy immune system.
Some studies are even looking into its role in preventing degenerative mental imbalances such as dementia and Alzheimer‚Äôs disease. And while many of us may do well in taking extra vitamin E supplements, we can use an organic diet to get a large amount of the daily requirements for this powerful antioxidant lipid. In fact, there are many common foods with vitamin E. You probably have a few in your house right now.
Foods With Vitamin E
Here are fifteen foods with vitamin E that you should strongly consider adding to your diet.
1. Almonds
Almonds are one the best vitamin E foods. Just an ounce of almonds offers a whopping 7.4 milligrams of vitamin E. You can also get your vitamin E needs in the form of almond milk and almond oils. We would recommend eating raw almonds, if possible.
2. Raw Seeds
Select raw seeds , such as sunflower, pumpkin and sesame, are another common food with vitamin E. In fact, eating just ¬º of a cup of sunflower seeds gives you 90.5% of your recommended daily value, making them one of the best vitamin E foods you can eat daily.
3. Swiss Chard
Swiss chard is easily one of the healthiest vegetables you can eat on a daily basis. Commonly known to be high in vitamin K, vitamin A and vitamin C, Swiss chard is another food high in vitamin E. Just one cup of boiled swiss chard greens will provide you with almost 17% of your daily recommended values.
4. Mustard Greens
Similar to swiss chard, mustard greens are very nutrient dense and will provide a variety of health benefits. Not only are they one of the best vitamin E foods, but mustard greens are also high in vitamin K, vitamin A, folate , and vitamin c. Eating just one cup of boiled mustard greens contains about 14% of your daily dietary requirements. We would recommend eating organic mustard greens, if possible.
5. Spinach
Spinach may not be your favorite veggie, but it is one of the best leafy greens you can add to your diet. Not only is it one of the best calcium foods and naturally high in folate, it‚Äôs also one of the best vitamin E foods as well. Just one cup of boiled spinach will provide you with approximately 20% of your daily needs. Try adding fresh spinach to your sandwiches to make them extra healthy.
6. Turnip Greens
While turnip greens may have a slightly bitter taste, they are very high in many essential nutrients. Like the rest of the leafy greens on this list, just one cup will provide you with plenty of vitamin K, vitamin A, vitamin C and folate. Not to mention approximately 12% of your daily requirements of vitamin E.
7. Kale
Kale is another great cruciferous vegetable you should eat as often as possible. Kale is very high in many nutrients, in fact, just one cup of boiled kale can give you almost 6% of your daily vitamin E requirements. We would recommend eating organic kale, if possible.
8. Plant oils
Most plant seed oils are very good sources for Vitamin E as well. The best oil with vitamin E is Wheat germ oil. In fact, one tablespoon of this oil holds 100% of your daily Vitamin E requirements. Sunflower oil is another excellent option, as it provides over 5 mg of the vitamin, and can easily be be used for cooking. Other great Vitamin-E-rich oils include hempseed oil, coconut oil, cottonseed oil (with almost 5 mg of vitamin E), olive oil and safflower oil. We would recommend only buying oils that are cold pressed unrefined and organic.
9. Hazelnuts
A perfect snack during a long workday, eating just one ounce of hazelnuts can provide you with approximately 20% of our daily requirements of vitamin E. For an alternative to eating nuts, try drinking hazelnut milk in your morning coffee instead of milk or flavored creamer.
10. Pine Nuts
Add an ounce of these nuts to anything you please! One serving contains 2.6 mg of vitamin E. You can also use pine nut oil for added health benefits.
11. Avocado
Perhaps one of the tastiest foods with Vitamin E, avocados represent natures creamiest, oil-rich food. Just half of an avocado holds more than 2 mg of vitamin E. Avocados are very easy to incorporate into your diet. We would recommend adding sliced avocados to your salad, a sandwich, or mashed up as guacamole!
12. Broccoli
For generations now, broccoli has been considered one of the best detox foods , but it‚Äôs also one of the healthiest foods high in Vitamin E. Just one cup of steamed broccoli will provide you with 4% of your daily requirements. Broccoli may not be as nutrient dense as other Vitamin E foods on this list, but it is definitely one of the healthiest foods you can eat daily.
13. Parsley
An excellent spice, parsley is another great Vitamin E food. Try adding fresh parsley to salads and dishes for an extra Vitamin-E kick. Dried parsley will also provide you with this important vitamin, but the fresher the better.
14. Papaya
This popular fruit is most commonly known as one of the best vitamin C foods , but it‚Äôs also high in Vitamin E. Just one papaya will give you approximately 17% of your daily needs.

15. Olives
From the oil to the fruit, eating olives is an excellent way of getting your daily needs for vitamin E. Just one cup of olives can give you approximately 20% of your daily recommended amount.

,"A leading US senator: US Supporting War in Syria
A leading US senator said the war in Syria would have been over by now if the US had put an end to its intervention when Russia entered the war-ravaged country.
‚ÄúIf the United States had just stayed out of it at that point, the war would be over by now; people would be rebuilding, refugees would be returning back to Syria, but the United States rushed anti-Tank missiles, and we used these so-called moderate rebels as a conduit to supply al-Nusra Front (also known as Fatah al-Sham Front), which is al-Qaeda in Syria,‚Äù republican member of the Virginia State in US Senate, Richard Hayden Black said in an exclusive interview with Press TV.
‚ÄúIf we were not supporting the war in Syria, I believe that the Syrians, combined with their allied forces from Iran, Lebanon and Russia‚Ä¶ would move very steadily and restore the borders of Syria.‚Äù
The senate member, who visited Syria in April, refused to distinguish between militants and terrorists fighting the government of President Bashar al-Assad, saying, the two are ‚Äúthoroughly integrated.‚Äù
‚ÄúThey really are one and the same, they‚Äôre part of the same army,‚Äù he said, citing a US defense intelligence agency‚Äôs investigation in 2013, which showed Washington‚Äôs ties with the terror group.
The outspoken state senator referred to plans by the CIA to transfer arms from Libya to Turkey and from there to Syria to supply the militants, noting that the move ‚Äúevolved into an indiscriminate program of supplying all militant groups, including specifically ISIL and al-Qaeda.‚Äù
‚ÄúWe do it indirectly because it‚Äôs unlawful to do it directly,‚Äù he said, adding that the US keeps ‚Äúextremely violent organizations‚Ä¶ off the terrorist watch list because these are the agents that take our weapons and then distribute them to ISIL and al-Qaeda.‚Äù
In response to a question on why Iran and Russia are portrayed as the ‚Äúbad guys,‚Äù while they are the ones really fighting terrorism there, as put recently by GOP presidential candidate Donald Trump, Black said the Republican candidate has a ‚Äúclear understanding of what‚Äôs happening over there.‚Äù
‚ÄúSometimes, his rhetoric has to match the political mood of the moment‚Ä¶ but I know a number of his advisers and they believe that our determination to topple the government in Syria is suicidal, that it threatens not only the entire Middle East but literally the entire world.‚Äù
He further warned that the US itself could be ‚Äúthreatened,‚Äù arguing that, ‚Äúif Syria falls, it will be dominated by some al-Qaeda-related organization; Lebanon will fall; Jordan will fall and the entire area will be destabilized.‚Äù
The Vietnam war veteran also elaborated on his personal definition of the Middle East ‚Äúaxis of evil,‚Äù naming Qatar, Saudi Arabia, and ‚Äúparticularly‚Äù Turkey over their support for terrorism.
‚ÄúProbably, three quarters of the rebels are not Syrian at all, they are mercenaries recruited by Turkey, Qatar and Saudi Arabia,‚Äù he asserted, describing the three countries as ‚Äúthe primary force behind the terrorist movement.‚Äù
‚ÄúTurkey has invaded Iraq and Syria with heavy military forces. Turkey has really become a rogue nation,‚Äù he added, referring to a 1923 treaty that set the border between Turkey and Greece, saying that was even being questioned by President Rececp Tayyip Erdogan.
‚ÄúAnd now you see this emerging threat against Western Europe by Turkey,‚Äù he noted, further adding that Erdogan ‚Äúhas made it clear that he looks to resurrection of the Ottoman Empire.‚Äù
‚ÄúHe has become more and more aggressive; he‚Äôs crushed the military, the free press; every powerful institution of the Turkish government has come under his iron fist and he‚Äôs now a total dictator. He‚Äôs a man who has said that he wants the constitution amended so that he will have power similar to those of Adolf Hilter‚Ä¶ This is our great ally; we‚Äôre allied with a man who would be Hitler.‚Äù
He also blasted Washington‚Äôs alliance with Saudi Arabia, ‚Äúwhere women are not allowed to walk out in the front yard to pick up the newspaper without a man‚Äôs permission; they can‚Äôt drive a car!‚Äù
‚ÄúSomehow, this is part of the liberalization that we seek to impose on the Middle East,‚Äù he said ironically, calling it ‚Äúbizarre.‚Äù
He also praised the resistance against the Saudi aggression by the people of Yemen, saying, ‚ÄúGod bless them! The Yemenis are giving the Saudis a bloody nose,‚Äù despite being a ‚Äútiny little, poor nation.‚Äù
‚ÄúI think the world recognizes that Saudi Arabia has just embarked in massive war crimes in Yemen,‚Äù he said, voicing regret over the US support for the monarchy.
‚ÄúWe don‚Äôt pay too much attention to them while engaged in war crimes because they‚Äôre our good allies,‚Äù he said, concluding that Washington is on a ‚Äúsuicidal course of action.‚Äù
‚ÄúSaudi money pays the very top politicians in many Western nations. And they really have co-opted the American military into acting as mercenaries for Wahhabism.‚ÄùBlack referred to the Western media‚Äôs portrayal of Iran as a supporter of terrorism, saying, ‚ÄúThe fact of the matter is that if you really look at global terrorism, it all emanates from Saudi Arabia.‚Äù
He exemplified various terrorists attack, including the 9/11, the Boston bombing, and the Brussels attacks, noting that they are all a ‚Äúreflection of the Wahhabi philosophy.‚Äù",1
Brisbane Dad Takes 7 Backyard Wickets In √¢‚Ç¨≈ìFrightening Return To Form√¢‚Ç¨¬ù,"Follow on Facebook Print This Post 
IMRAN GASHKORI | Sports Editor | 
As excitement for summer cricket builds, Wynnum father Chris Richards has honed his preparation, taking 7 wickets in a ‚Äúfrightening‚Äù spell yesterday. 
‚ÄúThey were coming out perfectly,‚Äù the 36-year-old said between celebratory beers. The Australian tradition of backyard cricket has gotten much more competitive in recent years. PHOTO: Supplied. 
‚ÄúWarnie always said one brings two‚Ä¶ In this case I went further,‚Äù he said. 
The full-time landscaper took the wickets of his three kids (aged 5, 8 & 13) as well as his wife (32) and two kids from down the street (ages unknown). 
‚ÄúI was a pretty talented junior but my best was only three or four for,‚Äù he said. 
Richards claimed the scalps in just four overs on his 16-meter backyard pitch aided by generous electric wickie rules and the controversial one-hand-one-bounce law. Richards vehemently denies that he tampered with the ball, despite half of it being covered in a mysterious tape for the duration of the match. PHOTO: Supplied. 
However, video has emerged of Richards allegedly tampering with the ball with what seems like red electrical tape. 
‚ÄúThe tape was already on the ball before we started playing. That‚Äôs well within the rules,‚Äù he said. 
Neighbours described his spell as ‚Äúfrightening and intense‚Äù but added numerous dismissals were through the six-and-out by-law. 
In addition to his economical and wicket-to-wicket line-and-length bowling style, Richards also used an impressive array of sledges and other psychological tactics to get under the skin of the opposition team. 
His daughter Kayla explains. 
‚ÄúDad would dip one in short and I‚Äôd have to dive out-of-the-way,‚Äù she said. 
‚ÄúEvery time I tried to dodge the short balls, he‚Äôd call me a poofter, which doesn‚Äôt make any sense to me,‚Äù 
Despite the criticism levelled against him, Richards has lashed out at his detractors. 
‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt hear Johno (Mitchell Johnson) whinge about how he takes ‚Äôem‚Äù the one-time 3rd grader said. 
‚ÄúI‚Äôm already growing the mo‚Äô so I can steam in with him when The Ashes start.‚Äù 
‚ÄúI played it smart. Me boy Jacob (aged 8 ) Is a pretty timid kid. I knew after knocking over Darcy (aged 5) with a full toss that he would be pretty nervous at the crease. I banged the first one in short to get him backing away. He was a frightened rabbit after that. All I had to do was put the next one on the stumps. Seven balls later I had his wicket.‚Äù 
With additional reporting from the Wynnum Advertiser.

Western QLD Drovers Show Solidarity With C.U.B Workers By Only Drinking Sauv Blanc ‚Äì The Betoota Advocate,"Follow on Facebook Print This Post 
CLANCY OVERELL | Editor | CONTACT 
The nationwide boycott of all Carlton United Brewery products reached new heights over the weekend, after it was revealed that a camp of ringers in Queensland‚Äôs Channel Country have only been drinking Sauvignon Blanc for the last five weeks. 
They join a growing political movement of punters that are abstaining from drinking any of Australia‚Äôs highest-selling beer brands, in a showing of support for 55 workers who lost their jobs at Carlton & United Breweries (CUB) in June. These men and women are also known as the #CUB55. 
The maintenance workers lost their jobs after CUB terminated a machine maintenance contract with employer Quant, they were then offered their jobs back again at a 65% lower wage, after penalty rates and other entitlements. 
E.H Pearson Cattle Company ‚Äòs head stockman, Ronnie Austin says although he and his mates often punch on with the unionised Betoota shearing contractors, joining the CUB Boycott was a ‚Äúno fucking brainer‚Äù. 
‚ÄúI‚Äôm usually not a big supporter of the Unions, but you can‚Äôt carry on the way these blokes have been‚Äù 
‚ÄúIt‚Äôs fucking crook, mate‚Äù 
Austin says it‚Äôs been hard work trying to avoid getting stuck into a few green demons at knock off after pushing cattle all day, but it‚Äôs their duty as fellow workers to support the CUB 55. 
‚ÄúIt‚Äôs been tough. But we are all starting to get around the lively fruit flavours of the Jacob‚Äôs Creek Sauvignon Blanc‚Äù 
‚ÄúThe passionfruit and citrus prevail across the palate, which is pretty much enhanced by the fresh natural acidity which provides vibrancy and length on the finish‚Äù 
With the Mount Isa New Years Eve Rodeo as the next big event pencilled in on their calendars, Austin says the Betoota boys are prepared to throw down with anyone who questions their choice of drink. 
‚ÄúIf CUB haven‚Äôt sorted this mess out by then, well yes of course we will still be drinking white wine on New Years Eve‚Äù 
‚ÄúIf anyone has problem with it then they can come and talk to me and Rocko. It won‚Äôt be the first time we‚Äôve had to bust heads in the Isa‚Äù 
‚ÄúIn fact anyone who wants to drink VB around me better have a note from their doctor because It‚Äôs just bloody unaustralian‚Äù 
It seems the CUB boycott has travelled across all cultures and state borders in Australia, with workers unions in Brisbane marching as well as hipster musicians now being forced to choose between supported the workers and drinking Melbourne Bitter ironically.

Rising Number Of Kids Growing Up Without Backyards Blamed For Aussie Cricket Slump,"Follow on Facebook Print This Post

Former Australian cricket captain, Ricky Ponting, has put the blame squarely on our nation‚Äôs town planners in the wake of another ‚Äúvery, very poor batting performance‚Äù that led to a heavy second Test defeat. 
‚ÄúHow do we expect to find any young talent when majority of our countries junior players are growing up in apartments?

George Soros is a rich liberal! WHEW! Scratch that. George Soros is the richest of liberals. 
He spent tens of millions of dollars trying to elect Hillary Clinton. Now that she lost‚Ä¶ 
He is focusing his attention on Donald Trump. 
THERE ARE RUMORS THAT HE IS LOSING SUPPORT! 
There is a 3¬≠day meeting at the Mandarin Oriental hotel beginning on Sunday, according to Politico. This event is sponsored by Democracy Alliance ‚Äì which is headed up by George Soros. 
Their plan is to stop Trump even after he has won the election. Yes. You heard that right. The election is not over. It‚Äôs going to be a long year.

Soros founded the Democracy Alliance in 2004. Members of the organization have to donate at least $200,000 a year to its recommended groups.

BREAKING Wikileaks: Abedin‚Äôs Computer Confirms HillaryClinton Was Behind Murder of Ambassador Stevens - BIG NUGGET NEWS,"

Dear Mr. Hodges, 
This is to inform you that Wikileaks will soon, or has released Clinton emails which will demonstrate the following: 

Please note that I have covered the ISIS/Lafarge/Clinton connections very prominently in the past year. This is just more confirmation of what I have already covered. 
The above is already appearing on the Internet in several places. It is clear that Putin would be a fool to allow Clinton and her gang of thugs to continue with their plan. Every time Clinton sags in the polls, she starts talking about 9/11. The evidence is beginning to line up that Clinton interests had motive to commit 9/11. No wonder Clinton tries to blame the Russians for everything, she is the main culprit on the world being brought to the precipice of World War III. 
It is a gratifying feeling when the dots start to connect. 
The Aaron Klein Revelations 
Aaron Klein, the Breitbart Bureau Chief for Jerusalem revealed, in a B reitbart publication dated March 1, 2016, revealed that ‚Äúthe email from April 10th, 2011, the State Department employee, Timmy Davis, forwarded an email to the server by Clinton‚Äôs aide, Huma Abedin .‚Äù Please note that the time of this revelation, Huma Abedin, was not yet a household name. VIDEO: Pizza Hut Employees Caught On Tape Taking Celebratory BONG HITS AT WORK! 
The series of emails will eventually have catastrophic consequences for Ambassador Stevens. ‚ÄúAn email containing the whereabouts and plans of murdered U.S. Ambassador Chris Stevens passed through Hillary Clinton‚Äôs private server, dispatches released Monday in the final group of messages from Clinton‚Äôs emails reveal.‚Äù 
Below are some examples of the allegations posed by Klein and these are not empty charges as Klein offered as proof, the following emails . 
‚ÄúA March 27, 2011 email released last year was titled, ‚ÄúChris Stevens mission.‚Äù It divulged: ‚ÄúThe current game plan is for Mr. Stevens to move no later than Wednesday from Malta to Benghazi. He will stage offshore initially for a one day visit during which he will have meetings with TNC interlocutors and get a sense of the situation on the ground. The goal of this one day trip is for him to lay the groundwork for a stay of up to 30 days. 
An April 8, 2011 email was forwarded to Clinton revealing the ‚Äúsecurity situation in Benghazi remains quiet. Chris Stevens & team are in the hotel, moving only for meetings as required.‚Äù 
An April 22, 2011 email revealed Stevens was on the road: ‚ÄúI want to let you know about a temporary rotation in Benghazi. TNC Envoy Chris Stevens has been on the road since March 13, when he began his outreach mission, and has been in Benghazi since April 5.‚Äù CONVICTED KILLER RELEASED FROM JAIL BY MISTAKE 
An April 24, 2011 email has the exact time of a Stevens meeting: ‚Äú‚ÄùStevens will be meeting with MFA in one hour and will make a written request for better security at the hotel and for better security-related coordination. He still feels comfortable in the hotel. They are looking into the idea of moving into a villa, but that is some way off.‚Äù 
If later emails are released, I have no doubt, that we will see that Clinton was transmitting Stevens location up until the time of the attack upon the Benghazi compound and this explains why some of these emails are not being released. However, at some point, they will see the light of day. 
The release of travel information, in any form, is a felony! Remember, the Stevens travel plans are classified and they came from Clinton‚Äôs private server. A casual Law and Order fan could make the causal connections between the release of these emails and Stevens death. This is absolute evidence that Clinton not only is guilty of multiple felonies, she is an accomplice to murder! ",1
"Teacher To 11 yr Old: 'I Can't Wait Until Trump Is Elected,He's Going To Deport All You Muslims'","0 427 
‚ÄúThat‚Äôs going to be you,‚Äù the Academy of Excellence teacher allegedly warned a 12-year-old Muslim student after showing the class a movie about the 9/11 attacks. And if that sounds outrageous, brace yourself because it gets a lot worse. 
No wonder the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) and the ACLU of Arizona are siccing the U.S. Dept. of Justice and the U.S. Dept. of Education on this travesty of a public charter school and this shameful example of an educator‚Äôs sorry a**. Heather Weaver from the ACLU‚Äôs national office reports they‚Äôve filed formal complaints on behalf of the Muslim student and his family. 
Asli Noor and her five children are refugees who settled in Phoenix, Arizona after fleeing Somalia. Like most parents, she wants opportunities and a good education for her children. And for many families ‚Äî especially those living in low-income neighborhoods ‚Äî that means a public charter school like the sadly misnamed ‚ÄúExcellence Academy.‚Äù 
The boy and his eight-year-old sister (referred to in the complaint as A.A. and F.A.) had started the 2015-2016 school year when the family‚Äôs new set of troubles began. 
According to the complaints, an ‚ÄúAcademy of Excellence‚Äù teacher named Faye Myles began ‚Äúsingling out‚Äù the then 11-year-old, sixth grade Muslim student as the 2015-16 school year began for ‚Äúdisfavorable treatment because of his faith and nationality.‚Äù 
‚ÄòAnother time, when A.A. raised his hand to answer a question, his teacher snapped at him‚Ää‚Äî‚Ää‚ÄúAll you Muslims think you are so smart‚Äù‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääin front of the entire class.‚Äô 
Oh, and then the boy recalls the math and science teacher for grades 5-8 digressing into a special kind of lesson in civics and current events. 
‚ÄòI can‚Äôt wait until Trump is elected. He‚Äôs going to deport all you Muslims. Muslims shouldn‚Äôt be given visas. They‚Äôll probably take away your visa and deport you. You‚Äôre going to be the next terrorist, I bet.‚Äô 
Faye Myles also allegedly found other ways to wound her young Muslim student with her bigotry. She repeatedly denied him the right to pray during recess, which is hard to imagine ever happening to a Christian student. The child also claims his ‚ÄúAcademy of Excellence‚Äù teacher would also would tell him to ‚Äúshut up‚Äù and punish him during class ‚Äúdowntime‚Äù when the other students were allowed to talk with each other. 
The bus rides home added to the child‚Äôs misery as his classmates began to follow the teacher‚Äôs example and pile on the insults. 
‚ÄòOn the bus ride home, A.A.‚Äôs classmates took up his teacher‚Äôs anti-Muslim, anti-immigrant crusade, taunting him about the fact that his visa would be revoked because he is a Muslim, calling him a ‚Äúterrorist,‚Äù and accusing him of planning to blow up the bus.‚Äô 
The child, of course, started feeling anxious and physically ill ‚Äúwith a stomach ache‚Äù and had no desire to return to the ‚ÄúAcademy of Excellence.‚Äù 
In January, Asli Noor met with school officials to complain about these incidents. Three days later, the school asked her to pick her son up early because he had supposedly tried to open the school bus‚Äô emergency window. Noor demanded they verify these accusations with footage from the security camera but school officials refused. 
And then Brenda Nelson, an ‚ÄúAcademy of Excellence‚Äù board member, printed out two ‚Äúvoluntary‚Äù withdrawal forms for A.A. and his younger sister F.A. She then allegedly ordered Ms. Noor to sign them, saying: 
‚ÄòGet your kids out of here. I don‚Äôt want them here.‚Äô 
When Asri Noor begged for time to find another school for her children, Brenda Nelson callously refused. 
Unfortunately, these incidents of anti-Muslim bigotry in publicly-funded schools are happening more frequently. Think Progress reports that even in schools where teachers try to fight it, Trump-inspired bullying is a serious issue. 
‚ÄòIn spite of some teachers‚Äô valiant efforts to teach students about Trump, it would appear that schoolchildren already invoke the candidate‚Äôs name to scare their Latino and Muslim classmates, referencing the candidate‚Äôs harsh claims of Latino criminals and Muslim terrorists.‚Äô 
And, sadly, it‚Äôs not just the kids. 
‚ÄòA predominantly Latino elementary school in California was graffiti-tagged with the words ‚ÄúBuild the wall higher‚Äù last week, alluding to Trump‚Äôs policy plan to build a southern U.S. border wall to keep out undocumented immigrants.‚Äô 
And in case you assume the ‚ÄúAcademy of Excellence‚Äù teacher is one of those mean white Trump supporters, you‚Äôre wrong. Apparently, she‚Äôs a mean black Trump supporter. @KhaledBeydoun The teacher works at Academy of Excellence & her name is Faye Myles per the article. She should be called out. pic.twitter.com/BbL3YdzEG8

"Trump Supporters Lose Control, Violently Harass Reporters At Rally (VIDEO)","0 407 
An unidentified supporter of Republican presidential candidate and alleged unregistered sex offender Donald Trump took to violently harassing members of the media at a Saturday night rally held in Phoenix, Arizona. 
The man, wearing a ‚ÄúHillary for Prison‚Äù t-shirt, screamed into the press area, ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre going down! You‚Äôre the enemy! You‚Äôre the ones working for the devil!,‚Äù before adapting the crowd‚Äôs ‚ÄúUSA‚Äù chant into ‚ÄúJew-s-a,‚Äù all the while continuing to scream at the members of the media in the press pen. 
Candace Smith, of ABC, was one of the reporters to capture the man‚Äôs disturbing behavior on tape. She posted video of the disturbing press area encounter to Twitter, a video which is featured below. This is the man who started chanting ‚ÄúJEW-S-A‚Äù at the media pen. Does anyone know what those hands signs mean? pic.twitter.com/64yseZFSVZ 
‚Äî Candace Smith (@CandaceSmith_) October 29, 2016 
Smith included in the text accompanying her video post a question, saying in reference to seemingly intentional hand gestures on the part of the Trump supporter, ‚ÄúDoes anyone know what those hand signs mean?‚Äù 
Smith got at least a couple noteworthy and credible responses. 
Clayton Swisher, whose Twitter bio reads that he is an ‚Äúinvestigative reporter and author,‚Äù suggested that the Trump supporter‚Äôs hand gestures are a variation of the ‚Äú88‚Äù hand sign used by white supremacists and described by the Anti-Defamation League as follows: 
‚ÄòOne of the most popular white supremacist symbols is the numeric symbol 88, which stands for ‚ÄúHeil Hitler‚Äù (substituting letters for numbers, 88 means HH, i.e., ‚ÄúHeil Hitler‚Äù). It is thus not surprising that white supremacists occasionally attempt to display 88 as a hand sign.‚Äô 
‚Äî Clayton Swisher (@claytonswisher) October 30, 2016 
A Twitter user identified as Marisel Morales suggested that the hand gestures were the ‚ÄúScwhurhand,‚Äù which is a German salute used in court. @CandaceSmith_ It's a German salute known as Schwurhand 
‚Äî Marisel Morales (@57MCM) October 29, 2016 
A Twitter user with the username ‚Äú@puppymnkey‚Äù countered, however, that the Trump supporter‚Äôs hand gestures didn‚Äôt quite match the Schwurhand, and instead pointed to a hand gesture version of the number ‚Äú666‚Äù employed by conspiracy theorists, a group almost certainly the man at the Trump rally. @57MCM @CandaceSmith_ nope. That salute is with pinky and index finger touching. It could be this given he's Infowars idiot pic.twitter.com/u953UYor2K

Nick Corasaniti of The New York Times was another member of the press to capture the man‚Äôs disturbing behavior on film. 
His video, which runs a bit after Smith‚Äôs video concludes, is featured below.

The U.S. Supreme Court‚Äôs gutting of the Voting Rights Act in 2013 was a huge win for the Republican Party. Since high voter turnout ‚Äî especially high minority voter turnout ‚Äî creates victories for Democrats, it makes sense for the GOP to keep as many people from voting as they possibly can. There‚Äôs just one thing the party of Donald Trump forgot: Voters still do have some rights, and the GOP doesn‚Äôt get to do whatever the hell it wants. 
Donald Trump‚Äôs calls for ‚Äúpoll watchers‚Äù to prevent nonexistent ‚Äúvoter fraud‚Äù may land the Republican Party in some serious hot water. AZ Central reports the Democratic Party of Arizona filed a lawsuit and seeks a court order banning Mein Trumpf‚Äôs bands of brown shirts from the polling places. 
‚ÄòThe suit filed in federal court in Phoenix Monday seeks an order blocking volunteer GOP poll watchers from harassing or photographing people headed to polling locations. The suit says the state Republican Party is essentially an arm of Trump‚Äôs campaign and the campaign and its backers have been organizing ‚Äúcitizen journalists‚Äù and ‚Äúpoll watchers‚Äù to flood minority-heavy polling sites on Nov. 8.‚Äô 
And despite the demise of key provisions of the Voting Rights Act, they‚Äôve still got some ammo. Last week, Rachel Maddow talked about something the GOP forgot about: That pesky old legal consent decree. Back in 1981, the Republican National Committee (RNC) employed similar ‚Äúpoll watcher‚Äù tactics during a tight governor race in New Jersey. Their ‚ÄúBallot Security Task Force‚Äù employed heavy-handed tactics in minority districts and won the race for their candidate by a razor thin margin. 
Unfortunately, the GOP‚Äôs short-term win backfired and had long-term consequences: a 35-year consent decree that puts strong limits on their ‚Äúpoll watching‚Äù activities. These legal restrictions don‚Äôt expire until next year. Naturally, Donald Trump‚Äôs renewed call for ‚Äúpoll watchers‚Äù has triggered concerns on the part of DNC lawyers at the national level. Now, they‚Äôre demanding that the courts extend the consent decree through 2025. Watch: Rachel Maddow explains how Trump‚Äôs call for ‚Äúpoll watchers‚Äù is causing legal trouble for the RNC. 
Of course, Tim Sifert, the state‚Äôs GOP spokesman, insists these poll watchers aren‚Äôt trying to intimidate voters. They‚Äôre just helping ‚Äúmonitor‚Äù polling places since ‚Äî thanks to SCOTUS ‚Äî we no longer have as many actual monitors for U.S. elections. But, as POLITICO points out, there‚Äôs a huge difference between having impartial observers around to provide advice and support for voters and poll workers and having ‚Äúpoll watchers‚Äù spreading misinformation and scaring voters. 
‚ÄòTrump seems to be advocating for a type of election monitoring that relies on volunteers to use deceptive practices that are often used to prevent people of color from voting. Voter suppression has changed since the era of literacy tests and poll taxes. In 2016, suppression occurs in two distinct stages: one before the election, and one at the polling locations themselves.‚Äô 
The POLITICO article explains how the GOP tries to scare people into not voting in two stages. Stage 1: Before an election, Republicans try to keep people from casting their ballots with false ‚Äî and sometimes scary ‚Äî information. In 2008, mailers went out telling Democratic voters in Virginia that Election Day had been moved from Tuesday to Wednesday. Meanwhile, black neighborhoods in Milwaukee (2004) and Philadelphia (2008) got plastered with flyers warning that people with unpaid child support and parking tickets might get arrested when they show up to vote. Stage 2: On election day, so-called ‚Äúpoll watchers‚Äù ‚Äî often with fake badges and IDs that make them look like they‚Äôre in positions of authority ‚Äî single out non-white voters with demands for ID and questions about their citizenship. They also often scare off eligible voters by taking photos and video footage (which sounds innocuous unless you happen to be among the roughly 7.5 million people being stalked each year). 
And, let‚Äôs not forget ‚Äî here‚Äôs what ‚Äúpoll watchers‚Äù looked like during the post-Civil War Reconstruction era. ",1
BREAKING: Trump Announces DEVASTATING Cuts To Social Security & His Reason Will Make You Vomit,"0 419 
Social Security is the lifeline of many people who are either too elderly or disabled to support themselves or their loved ones financially. However, to Republicans and conservatives alike, it is an expenditure deemed too costly, even if it means certain death for those who depend on it. 
Forget for a moment that elderly people who worked their entire lives have paid into social security, and should therefore be completely off limits. How could anyone with a soul leave the elderly to die in poverty? And what about those people who are physically and/or mentally disabled? Should we, as a nation, not take care of those citizens? Should we leave them to survive on the streets? 
Donald Trump is not known to do much critical thinking, especially before releasing a statement to the media, but his insane remarks on cutting Social Security have really got liberals fuming. Check out that time Trump told Paul Ryan that he would love to cut Social Security if he didn‚Äôt think it would be political suicide: 
‚ÄúFrom a moral standpoint, I believe in it. But you also have to get elected. And there‚Äôs no way a Republican is going to beat a Democrat when the Republican is saying, ‚ÄòWe‚Äôre going to cut your Social Security‚Äô and the Democrat is saying, ‚ÄòWe‚Äôre going to keep it and give you more.‚Äô‚Äâ‚Äù 
Trump is really trying to say that the lazy people in this country will always vote Democrat because it is Democrats who ensure that the less fortunate are, at least, able to keep their heads above water. To politicians like Donald Trump, these ‚Äúextras‚Äù are killing the country. 
That‚Äôs right folks, it‚Äôs Ma and Pa Kettle who are ruining the country with their $1200 monthly allotment from the Treasury Department. It certainly wouldn‚Äôt be wasteful, greedy real estate moguls who use other people‚Äôs money to pay for their extravagant business deals. 
Alex Lawson is the Executive Director of Social Security Works, and he has a much different theory on Trump‚Äôs motives with Social Security. Lawson had this to say about it: 
‚ÄúIt is really clear: Donald Trump would 100 percent go along with the Republican donor class position of cutting Social Security. He openly says he will lie to the people about it because he knows that the people are against it.‚Äù 
‚ÄúIn his eyes the ‚Äòmoral‚Äô thing to do is to steal people‚Äôs hard-earned benefits and not talk about it.‚Äù 
As we have learned throughout this election season, Donald Trump almost never tells the truth. Yet, he still convinces his mindless followers that he would somehow be good for America, regardless of the fact that there is nothing but evidence to prove the opposite. Trump won‚Äôt be happy until our grandparents are living in squalor and eating ramen for every meal.

"BREAKING: Trump Dramatically Rushed Off Stage By Secret Service, Chaos Ensues (VIDEO)","0 39 
The Republican presidential candidate, Donald Trump, suffered a serious scare tonight after being rushed off the campaign stage by Secret Service in Reno, Nevada. 
CNN reported that a crowd member yelled someone had a gun in the crowd. The scuffle happened close to the front of the stage. Secret Service removed one individual who appeared to be a white man in his 30s or 40s. 
However, Trump was quick to return to the stage after the individual was detained by local law enforcement and Secret Service. CNN reported that a SWAT unit also showed up at the front of the crowd.

"Julian Assange Makes VERY Suspect Post Election Announcement, Seeks Pardon From Trump","0 122 
WikiLeaks co-founder Julian Assange‚Äôs lawyers have suggested that the globally detested, thorn in the side social figure will keep at, and even perhaps intensify, efforts to be fully pardoned by the United States once President-elect Donald Trump takes office next year. 
Assange‚Äôs lawyers made the announcement after the controversial global ‚Äúwhistleblower‚Äù spoke with Swedish authorities who had come to consult with him within the neutral territory of the Ecuadorian embassy in the U.K. over rape charges which Assange faces in Sweden. 
Assange has been holed up in the aforementioned embassy for years in an effort to escape facing the diverse set of global charges which have been lobbed against him. 
And, as for a pivoted effort for Assange to escape the charges he faces, one directed at attempting to garner a Trump signed, U.S. presidential pardon, Assange‚Äôs lawyers said, according to London‚Äôs Evening Standard , ‚ÄúThrough U.S. counsel, we had reached out to the Obama administration, most recently just a few months ago, and we will continue to do so with future U.S. administrations until the investigation is closed.‚Äù 
These efforts at a presidential pardon for Assange began, as noted, under the Obama administration, but with Obama‚Äôs own federal appointments and the soon to be former president himself as the ones to ever begin an investigation into Assange in the first place, efforts for an Obama pardon of Assange unsurprisingly never got anywhere. 
The U.S. investigation was first prompted by Assange‚Äôs publication of classified documents related to the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan delivered to him by Army whistleblower Bradley/Chelsea Manning ‚Äî who, mind you, is still in American custody and doesn‚Äôt seem to have much of a hope of release anytime soon. 
Assange‚Äôs more recent work, during the lead up to Election Day, quickly turned into an elaborate anti-Clinton campaign, one viewed by American intelligence officials as backed by the Russian government in the interest of seeing their preferred candidate ‚Äî Trump ‚Äî elected to the presidency. 
WikiLeaks published in this time frame a huge cache of emails hacked from key members of the Democratic Party leadership and the Hillary Clinton presidential campaign, targeting figures from the now former party chairperson and U.S. Representative Debbie Wasserman Schultz to Clinton campaign chairman John Podesta. WikiLeaks also released many thousands of emails taken from Clinton‚Äôs tenure as secretary of state serving under President Obama. 
The credibility of the emails has been occasionally questioned. Indeed, even if the organization only received and hacked actual emails and the like that had actually come from Democratic Party officials. WikiLeaks was still found, on multiple occasions, to have been improperly spinning the email contents. Such as the time a mundane email about then Secretary of State Hillary Clinton‚Äôs UN translation providing earpiece, was spun into a fake story about Clinton using an earpiece to be fed what she was supposed to say. 
Trump is far from predictable enough for any observer to definitively suggest his course of action regarding Assange once he takes office. He continues to surround himself with figures ranging from ‚Äúlevel-headed,‚Äù establishment conservatives like Reince Priebus, to the far right controversial at best conservative media guru Steve Bannon.

"Pope Francis Takes Backhanded Swipe At Trump, & Those Who 'Raise Walls, & Label People'","0 129 
On Saturday, during a ceremony welcoming 17 new cardinals into the Roman Catholic Church, Pope Francis warned attendees about the divisiveness that he feels is spreading throughout the church. The Associated Press reports that Pope Francis cautioned against the ‚Äúvirus of polarization,‚Äù telling the new group of cardinals, ‚Äúwe are not immune from this.‚Äù 
During his speech, Pope Francis specifically issued a warning about ‚Äúour pitiful hearts that tend to judge, divide, oppose, and condemn‚Äù and those who ‚Äúraise walls, build barriers, and label people.‚Äù He also encouraged those in attendance to not be so quick to deem those who are different from them an enemy or a threat. 
‚ÄòWe see, for example, how quickly those among us with the status of the stranger, an immigrant, or a refugee, become a threat, take on the status of an enemy. An enemy because they come from a distant country, or have different customs. 
‚ÄòThe virus of polarization and animosity permeates our way of thinking, feeling and acting.‚Äô 
Pope Francis never called out Donald Trump by name; however, it seems to be more than a mere coincidence that he delivered a speech about accepting immigrants shortly after the United States electorate chose as their leader for the next four years a man who has proposed mass deportation and the construction of a wall on the U.S.-Mexico border. 
This is not the first time that the Pope has spoken out against Donald Trump and his campaign promises, either. In February of this year, when asked about Trump‚Äôs proposed border wall, he said , ‚Äúa person who only thinks about building walls, wherever they may be, and not building bridges, is not Christian.‚Äù 
At least one of the newly appointed cardinals has views similar to Pope Francis‚Äôs when it comes to immigration. Indianapolis Archbishop Joseph Tobin, who was in the news recently for helping to resettle Syrian refugees despite now vice president-elect Mike Pence‚Äôs best efforts to block aid to and limit the number of Syrian refugees in Indiana. 
Tobin recently addressed Trump‚Äôs victory, saying that, under him, the priority of settling immigrants and refugees ‚Äúis going to be challenging.‚Äù He added, though, that he believes ‚Äúthe ethical reflection of a nation isn‚Äôt reduced to the government‚Äù and said that he has ‚Äúa lot of faith in the American people.‚Äù

JUST IN: ACLU Makes FULL PAGE Donald Trump Announcement Via New York Times (IMAGE),"0 1949 
The ACLU has got a few words for America‚Äôs newest elected ‚Äúleader,‚Äù and the letter they just published through the NY Times, is probably the most amazing jab in the history of politics. It doesn‚Äôt hurt that the jab came from the American Civil Liberties Union, because the power behind the letter is what makes it so ominous to the president-elect. 
The letter begins with a request for Trump to ‚Äúchange course‚Äù on many of the claims he has made in his extremely short political career. 
‚ÄúDear President-Elect Trump, 
For nearly 100 years, the ACLU has stood as this nation‚Äôs premier defender of freedom and justice for all. 
As you assume the nation‚Äôs highest office, we must ask you now as president-elect to reconsider and change course on certain campaign promises you have made. 
Specifically, you promised to: amass deportation force to remove 11 million undocumented immigrants ban the entry of Muslims and institute aggressive surveillance programs targeting them restrict a woman‚Äôs right to abortion services reauthorize waterboarding and other forms of torture change our nation‚Äôs libel laws and restrict freedom of expression‚Äù 
As if this statement alone wasn‚Äôt enough of a threat, the ACLU continues: 
‚ÄúThese proposals are not simply un-American and wrong-headed. They are unlawful and unconstitutional, and would violate the First, Fourth, Fifth, Eighth, and Fourteenth Amendments of the Constitution, as well as other statutes and international treaties.‚Äù 
‚ÄúMany of our country‚Äôs most cherished rights are the result of ACLU litigation and advocacy. They include the Scopes trial (the right to teach evolution in public science classrooms) and the following Supreme Court cases: Korematsu (challenging Japanese American internment); Miranda (the right to remain silent); Griswold (the right to contraception); Loving (the right of interracial couples to marry); Gideon (the right to a court-appointed attorney if you can‚Äôt afford one); Windsor (striking down the federal Defense of Marriage Act); and Obergefell (the right of same-sex couples to marry) and others. We have worked with and battled American presidents of both parties to ensure that our country makes good on it‚Äôs founding premise as the land of the free.‚Äù 
In the end of the open letter, the ACLU promises to make Trump‚Äôs life a nightmare if he continues to pave his road to concentration camp hell. They say Trump will have the full firepower of the ACLU to deal with if he doesn‚Äôt wise up. 
They letter concludes: 
‚ÄúIf you do not reverse course and endeavor to make these campaign promises a reality, you will have to contend with the full firepower of the ACLU at your every step. Our staff of litigators and activists in every state, thousands of volunteers, and millions of supporters stand ready to fight against any encroachment on our cherished freedoms and rights.‚Äù 
‚ÄúOne thing is certain: We will be vigilant every day of your tenure as president. And when you ultimately vacate the Oval Office, we will do likewise with your successor.‚Äù Today we published a full-page open letter in the New York Times to President-elect Trump pic.twitter.com/FOpRqn9oNY

BREAKING: Donald Trump Makes MAJOR Clinton Indictment Announcement (DETAILS),"0 66 
A source at MSNBC‚Äôs Morning Joe confirms that the newly-elected Trump has made a decision regarding Hillary Clinton‚Äôs use of a private email server during her time as secretary of state. Source tells @Morning_Joe @realDonaldTrump won‚Äôt pursue investigations into @HillaryClinton for private email server use/Clinton Foundation. 
‚Äî Morning Joe (@Morning_Joe) November 22, 2016 
Despite all his campaign bluster, when he was calling Clinton ‚Äúcrooked Hillary‚Äù and promising that Clinton would ‚Äúbe in jail‚Äù once he was president, it seems Trump has had a change of heart. It seems like only a month ago that Donald Trump told his supporters that: 
‚ÄòThis is the most heinous, the most serious thing that I‚Äôve ever seen involving justice in the United States ‚Äî in the history of the United States.‚Äô 
In fact, it was only a month ago. Trump promised his bloodthirsty supporters that he would ‚Äúlock her up‚Äù as president, and just six weeks ago Trump promised during the second presidential debate that he would appoint a ‚Äúspecial prosecutor‚Äù to look into Hillary Clinton‚Äôs ‚Äúsituation‚Äù regarding her use of a private email server. 
Five days after being elected, Trump did one of the most rapid walkbacks in presidential history when asked about that ‚Äúspecial prosecutor‚Äù to throw Hillary Clinton in prison. When asked by 60 Minutes interviewer, Lesley Stahl, about his plans for the former secretary of state, Trump balked. 
‚ÄòI don‚Äôt want to hurt them. I don‚Äôt want to hurt them. They‚Äôre, they‚Äôre good people. I don‚Äôt want to hurt them. And I will give you a very, very good and definitive answer the next time we do 60 Minutes together.‚Äô 
The same man who fanned the flames with supporters who called Clinton a ‚Äúcriminal‚Äù and ‚Äúevil,‚Äù who exploited women who claimed that they were sexually assaulted by Bill Clinton and laughed at as a child rape victim by Hillary Clinton, now wants the American public to know that Bill and Hillary Clinton are ‚Äúgood people.‚Äù 
Of course, it was never in question whether or not Hillary Clinton would be convicted of a crime or sentenced to prison, since multiple investigations by GOP-led committees regarding Benghazi and two investigations by the FBI regarding the private email server that Clinton and every modern predecessor of hers used turned up no evidence of criminal wrongdoing. 
Just like every other promise Trump made on the campaign trail to attract voters with vengeance and hatred on their minds, it was all just smoke and mirrors.

Fighting Ghost Fascists While Aiding Real Ones,"2016 presidential campaign by BAR executive editor Glen Ford 
An architect of regime-change, coups, no-fly zones, rule of the rich and mass incarceration is about to become Commander-in-Chief, yet the bulk of what passes for the Left is ‚Äúengaged in a 1930s-style ‚Äòunited front‚Äô against a ‚Äòfascism‚Äô that was never a threat in 21 st century America.‚Äù Donald Trump, the orange menace, didn‚Äôt have a chance of becoming president. Hillary Clinton, on the other hand, is a 21 st century fascist and threat to life on Earth. Fighting Ghost Fascists While Aiding Real Ones by BAR executive editor Glen Ford 
‚ÄúTrump‚Äôs anti-‚Äúfree trade‚Äù stance and opposition to regime change and military confrontation with Russia and China drove most of the Republican-allied section of the ruling class straight into Hillary Clinton‚Äôs imperial Big Tent.‚Äù 
Hillary Clinton‚Äôs impending -- and totally predictable -- landslide victory on November 8 will prove only that there never was any danger of a ‚Äúfascist‚Äù white nationalist takeover of the U.S. executive branch of government in 2016. That was always a red (or ‚Äúorange‚Äù) herring, a phony ‚Äúbarbarians at the gate‚Äù threat that -- as Wikileaks documents confirmed -- John Podesta and Hillary‚Äôs other handlers fervently hoped would convey ‚Äúlesser evil‚Äù status to their manifestly unpopular candidate. 
There was nothing particularly devious or out of the ordinary in the Hillary camp‚Äôs favoring Donald Trump or, alternatively, Ted Cruz. It is standard Democratic Party practice to position themselves just to the left of the Republicans. In a duopoly electoral system, victory lies in where the cake is cut. By hugging close to the GOP‚Äôs flanks, national Democratic candidates can lay claim to a ‚Äúcenter-left‚Äù spectrum of political space that encompasses a clear majority of U.S. public opinion on most issues. By this calculus, Democrats are supposed to win, unless they are tripped up on the closely related issues of race (failure to ‚Äústand up‚Äù to the Blacks) and foreign policy (failure to ‚Äústand up‚Äù to whoever is the designated foreign enemy). 
Race is the trickiest part of the equation, since white supremacy is embedded in the American political conversation, hiding just beneath the surface of most discourse on social and economic policy. 
‚ÄúHis overt racism probably weakened his appeal to whites.‚Äù 
Trump thought he could win by combining an overt white racist appeal with an anti-corporate message that laid the blame on Wall Street for (white) American job losses and falling living standards. He also calculated -- correctly, it turns out -- that in the wake of the 2008 economic meltdown, many white Americans were more upset about their own economic and social status than they were angry at Russians; that they wanted regime change at home more than abroad. 
Both of Trump‚Äôs central policies backfired, dooming his campaign. His overt racism probably weakened his appeal to whites, who have given majorities to national Republicans since 1968 but whose self-image is that they are not, as individuals, racist. (Certainly, white women found further reason to reject his candidacy.) Much more spectacularly, Trump‚Äôs anti-‚Äúfree trade‚Äù stance and opposition to regime change and military confrontation with Russia and China drove most of the Republican-allied section of the ruling class straight into Hillary Clinton‚Äôs imperial Big Tent. 
At the national level, the duopoly system, as we had known it, virtually ceased to exist ‚Äì a fact dramatically driven home by the near-universal corporate media rejection of Donald Trump, the candidacy they had done so much to create. The near-collapse of the duopoly system was the great fracture of the 2016 election, a potential historic opening to a far wider space of progressive political struggle, including on the moribund electoral level. With the ruling class gathered in one Big Tent, and the overt racists occupying the imploded shell of the GOP, the system itself was in disarray. What was once two vibrant parties of the ruling class, with a virtual monopoly on the totality of the electorate, had become one ruling class party plus a hollowed-out husk, at least temporarily occupied by white nationalists under the leadership of a narcissistic and incoherent billionaire, yet without enough funds to mount a competitive general election campaign. 
‚ÄúThe near-collapse of the duopoly system was the great fracture of the 2016 election.‚Äù 
In these pages, we had been saying since last year that Donald Trump could not win; that Bernie Sanders‚Äô fate would be sealed in the southern primaries; and that, although ruling class money would insure Clinton an election by landslide, it could not buy her legitimacy among a significant section of the Democratic ‚Äúbase,‚Äù who would now be pushed to the latrine area of her Big Tent. As we wrote on May 18 of this year: 
‚ÄúOutsized fear of Trump is hysteria. These days, the ‚Äòbrown shirts‚Äô wear blue. Hillary is the candidate of Wall Street, War and Austerity ‚Äì not Trump, the racist America Firster. And, he can‚Äôt win, anyway ‚Äì not with tens of millions of ‚Äòmoderate‚Äô Republicans and most of the party‚Äôs funders rushing into Hillary‚Äôs welcoming embrace.‚Äù 
But sadly, hysteria does reign in most of the ‚Äúleft‚Äù precincts of America. Those who did not hesitate to kick Hillary when she appeared to be ‚Äúdown‚Äù -- in those heady days when they imagined it was possible she could lose to Sanders -- are terrified to kick her when she is ‚Äúup‚Äù and primed to take the helm of the hyper-power. They are engaged in a 1930s-style ‚Äúunited front‚Äù against a ‚Äúfascism‚Äù that was never a threat in 21 st century America, where a different kind of dictatorship of the rich (but also a fascism) has made brown-shirts (and Klansmen) utterly superfluous. These trembling leftists refuse to oppose the modern manifestation of fascism, which is now firmly entrenched in power with Hillary as its champion, in favor of a crusade against an ‚Äúorange‚Äù menace that did not have a ghost of a chance of seizing national power. They have made themselves perfectly irrelevant and useless -- except, of course, to the fascists-in-charge. BAR executive editor Glen Ford can be contacted at [email protected] .",1

When astute political commentary from a half century ago eloquently describes the current political conundrum it means we‚Äôve been stuck in a bad place for a long time. Do we really want Malcolm‚Äôs observation to apply four or eight or twenty years further into the future? Malcolm X on Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump A Black Agenda Radio Commentary by Bruce A. Dixon 
It‚Äôs that time again, it‚Äôs presidential election season, and as we hear every four years, THIS is the most important presidential election of our lives. The fact that you‚Äôve heard that before should tell us something. It should us that in presidential years, many old things becomes new again, often because so much of what we‚Äôre told IS new is really pretty old. 
Malcolm X has been dead now a half century, dead for more years than he was ever alive. But since at least one of the tricks and traps deployed to fool, frustrate and neutralize our grandparents‚Äô right to vote hasn‚Äôt changed much we might want to listen carefully to what Malcolm‚Äôs words in the aftermath of the 1964 presidential election. 
‚Äú If Johnson had been running all by himself, he would not have been acceptable to anyone. The only thing that made him acceptable to the world was that the shrewd capitalists, the shrewd imperialists, knew that the only way people would run toward the fox would be if you showed them a wolf. So they created a ghastly alternative. And it had the whole world ‚Äî including people who call themselves Marxists ‚Äî hoping that Johnson would beat Goldwater.‚Äù 
Like today‚Äôs Donald Trump, Republican presidential candidate Barry Goldwater was a truly reprehensible and frightening figure, who had opposed the Civil Rights Act of 1964 that banned racial discrimination in public accommodations, and who favored the use of nuclear weapons to defoliate the Vietnamese countryside. Also like Donald Trump, Goldwater never really stood a chance of winning the election. Goldwater the wolf was buried beneath a Johnson landslide, carrying only 6 out of the 50 states. Republican officeholders are running away from Donald Trump not because he‚Äôs a racist bufoon but because he‚Äôs expected to lose states Republicans are accustomed to winning. 
The fox, Lyndon Baines Johnson went on to start a war in Indochina that killed three million Vietnamese alone. LBJ defoliated the Vietnamese countryside with millions of tons of Agent Orange instead of nukes, causing hundreds of thousands of hideous and gruesome birth defects that continue to this day. 
The wolf and the fox this year are Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton. Trump is a real estate con man, a racist and a hyper-entitled sexual predator who talks about building walls and banning Muslims. Fortunately for us all, Trump has never been in government. Hillary has scarcely ever been out of government. She‚Äôs fronted for Wal-Mart, executed bloody regime change in Libya, brought US troops to Ukraine on the Russian border, and publicly itches for a showdown in Syria. Thanks to Wikileaks there is copious evidence that Hillary‚Äôs public stands on a wide range of issues from charter schools to so-called trade agreements, to fracking and social security stand in stark contrast to the promises she makes to the powerful. 
Just as it worked 52 years ago, the overwhelming defeat of her wolvish opponent will give Hillary the appearance of a mandate. But the margin of Hillary‚Äôs victory provides those of us on the left an unprecedented opportunity. It means there is no need for those who imagine themselves on the of jobs, justice, peace and the planet to ride to Hilllary‚Äôs rescue and ensure the defeat of Donald Trump. Trump has already beaten himself. 
This election is our best chance to break out of the decades-old two party trap and build a new political force, a new political party. The Green Party is the only peace party, the only party that stands for people and planet over profit, and our only opportunity to vote our hopes, not our fears. It‚Äôs time to choose. 
We vote Green and build Green, we can consign the political conundrum Malcolm X eloquently described a half century ago to the garbage can of history. Or we can vote for Hillary, and Malcolm‚Äôs words will be as applicable four or eight years or twenty years from now as they have been for the last fifty. For Black Agenda Radio I‚Äôm Bruce Dixon.

The Lords of Capital Sic Crazy Hillary on the World,"Tweet Widget A Black Agenda Radio commentary by executive editor Glen Ford 
The capitalist ruling class is frightened, for good reason: the empire cannot peacefully contain the rising economic powers of the South and East. ‚ÄúThe Lords of Capital know there is no future for them in a world where the dollar is not supreme and where Wall Street‚Äôs stocks, bonds and derivatives are not backed by the full weight of unchallenged empire.‚Äù War is the only card they have left to play ‚Äì and Hillary Clinton is their favored dealer. The Lords of Capital Sic Crazy Hillary on the World A Black Agenda Radio commentary by executive editor Glen Ford 
‚ÄúThe Lords of Capital are creatures of U.S. imperial dominance; they go out of business when the empire does.‚Äù 
By virtually every measurement, the United States is in deep crisis, as both a society and as the headquarters of global capitalism. We can roughly measure the severity of some aspects of the crisis with the tools of economic analysis. Such an analysis is quite useful in explaining why Washington is so eager to risk war with Russia and China, whether in Syria or the South China Sea or along the ever expanding borders of NATO. To put it simply, the U.S. and western Europe become smaller, in terms of their economic influence, with every passing day, and cannot possibly maintain their political dominance in the world except by military force, coercion and terror. Those are the only cards the imperialists have left to play. The ruling circles in the U.S. are aware that time is not on their side, and it makes them crazy -- or crazier than usual. 
The ruling class‚Äôs own analysts tell them that the center of the world economy is moving inexorably to the East and the South; that this trend will continue for the foreseeable future; and that the U.S. is already number two by some economic measures -- and dropping. The Lords of Capital know there is no future for them in a world where the dollar is not supreme and where Wall Street‚Äôs stocks, bonds and derivatives are not backed by the full weight of unchallenged empire. Put another way, U.S. imperialism is at an inflection point, with all the indicators pointing downward and no hope of reversing the trend by peaceful means. 
Now, that‚Äôs actually not such a bad prognosis for the United States, as a country. The U.S. is a big country, with an abundance of human and natural resources, and would do just fine in a world among equals. But, the fate of the Lords of Capital is tied to the ongoing existence of empire. They create nothing, but seek to monetize and turn a profit on everything. They cannot succeed in trade unless it is rigged, and have placed bets in their casinos that are nominally seven times more valuable than the total economic activity of planet Earth. In short, the Lords of Capital are creatures of U.S. imperial dominance; they go out of business when the empire does. 
Beat the Clock 
The rulers are looking class death in the face -- and it terrifies them. And when the Lords of Capital become frightened, they order their servants in politics and the war industries and the vast national security networks to take care of the problem, by any means necessary. That means militarily encircling Russia and China; arming and mobilizing tens of thousands of jihadist terrorists in Syria, in an attempt to repeat the regime change in Libya; waging a war of economic sanctions and low-level armed aggression against Iran; occupying most of the African continent through subversion of African militaries; escalating subversion in Latin America; and spying on everyone on earth with a digital connection. All this, to stop the clock that is ticking on U.S. and European world economic dominance. 
Left political analysts that I greatly respect argue that Hillary Clinton and the mob she will come in with in January will pull back from apocalyptic confrontation with Russia in Syria -- that they‚Äôre not really that crazy. But, I‚Äôm not at all convinced. The ruling class isn‚Äôt just imagining that their days are numbered; it‚Äôs really true. And rulers do get crazy when their class is standing at death‚Äôs door.

Freedom Rider: Russophobia: War Party Propaganda,"Tweet Widget b y BAR editor and senior columnist Margaret Kimberley 
The world‚Äôs most reactionary regime, the head-chopping, terror-sponsoring Saudi Arabian kleptocracy, was awarded the chair of the UN Human Rights Council, while Russia has been kicked out. The travesty was engineered by the Superpower of Lies to punish Moscow for resisting the U.S.-led war of sectarian massacre and regime change in Syria. The War Party is on the march, to the cheers of corporate media ‚Äì and Hillary hasn‚Äôt even been elected yet. Freedom Rider : Russophobia: War Party Propaganda b y BAR editor and senior columnist Margaret Kimberley 
‚Äú All attempts to stop the fighting were rejected by the U.S. and NATO and sealed the fate of the Syrian people.‚Äù 
Did Russia invade Iraq and kill one million people? Does Russia have a greater percentage of its population behind bars than any other country in the world? Did Russia occupy Haiti after kidnapping its president? Are Russian police allowed to shoot children to death without fear of repercussion? Is Russia entering its 20 th year of a terror war against the people of Somalia? All of these crimes take place in or at the direction of the United States. Yet the full force of propaganda and influence on world opinion is directed against Russia, which whatever its shortcomings cannot hold a candle to America in violating human rights. 
The dangers presented by a Hillary Clinton presidency cannot be overstated. She and the war party have been steadily working towards a goal that defies logic and risks all life on earth. Regime change is once again their modus operandi and they hope to make it a reality against Russia. 
Nearly every claim of Russian evil doing is a lie, a ruse meant to put Americans in a fighting mood and lose their fear of nuclear conflagration. It isn‚Äôt clear if Clinton and the rest of the would-be warriors actually realize they are risking mushroom clouds. Perhaps they believe that Vladimir Putin will be easily pushed around when all evidence points to the contrary. 
‚Äú Regime change is once again their modus operandi and they hope to make it a reality against Russia.‚Äù 
The unproven allegations of interference in the presidential election and casting blame on Russia as the sole cause of suffering in Syria are meant to desensitize the public. It is an age old ploy which makes war not just acceptable but deemed a necessity. The usual suspects are helping out eagerly. The corporate media, led by newspapers like the New York Times and Washington Post , are front and center in pushing tales of Russian villainy. Human Rights Watch and other organizations who care nothing about abuses committed by the United States and its allies are also playing their usual role of choosing the next regime change victim. 
Russia lost its seat on the United Nations Human Rights Council in part because of American pressure and public relations assistance from the human rights industrial complex. The UNHRC is now chaired by Saudi Arabia. Saudi Arabia is an absolute monarchy that funds the jihadist terrorist groups who caused 500,000 Syrian deaths. The Saudis are causing dislocation, death and starvation in Yemen, too, but they are American allies, so there is little opposition to their misdeeds. 
The openly bigoted Donald Trump has been the perfect foil for Hillary Clinton. That is why she and the rest of the Democratic Party leadership preferred him as their rival. He made the case for the discredited lesser evilism argument and his sensible statements about avoiding enmity with Russia made him even more useful. 
‚Äú Newspapers like the New York Times and Washington Post, are front and center in pushing tales of Russian villainy.‚Äù 
The United States and its allies are the cause of Syria‚Äôs destruction. Their effort to overthrow president Assad created a humanitarian disaster complete with ISIS and al Nusra fighters who love to chop off heads for entertainment. Far from being the cause of the catastrophe Russia left its ally to fight alone for four years. They even made overtures to negotiate Assad‚Äôs fate with the United States. All attempts to stop the fighting were rejected by the U.S. and NATO and sealed the fate of the Syrian people. The people of east Aleppo are being shelled by American allies but one wouldn‚Äôt know that by reading what passes for journalism in newspapers and on television. The American role in the slaughter is barely mentioned or is excused as an effort to protect the civilian population. The bloodshed was made in the U.S. and could end if this government wanted it to. 
The anti-Russian propaganda effort has worked to perfection. NATO is massing troops on Russia‚Äôs borders in a clear provocation yet Putin is labeled the bad guy. He is said to be menacing the countries that join in threatening his nation. The United States makes phony claims of Russian war crimes despite having blood on its hands. The latest Human Rights Watch canards about prosecuting Assad come straight from the White House and State Department and have nothing to do with concern for Syrians living in their fifth year of hell. 
‚ÄúDonald Trump has been the perfect foil for Hillary Clinton.‚Äù 
There is no lesser evil between Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump. She is fully supported by the war party in her desire for a more ‚Äúmuscular‚Äù foreign policy. That bizarre term means death and starvation for millions more people if Clinton wins in a landslide. She must be denied a victory of that magnitude and any opportunity to claim a mandate. Peace loving people must give their votes to the Green Party ticket of Jill Stein and Ajamu Baraka. They are alone in rejecting the premise of an imperialist country and its endless wars. 
The United States is the most dangerous country in the world. If it has a reckless and war loving president the threat becomes existential. That is the prospect we face with a Hillary Clinton presidency. If the role of villain is cast on the world stage she is the star of the show.

Green Party‚Äôs Margaret Flowers Challenges US Senate Debate in Maryland as Undemocratic,"2016 elections by BAR editor and columnist, Dr. Marsha Adebayo 
The ‚Äúrevolving, rigged system‚Äù that purports to be American democracy was revealed in all its corporate vulgarity on a Baltimore university stage, last week. Two U.S. Senate candidates of the duopoly parties pretended to support the Green Party‚Äôs candidate‚Äôs right to join the debate, but failed to protest when cops hauled her away. ‚ÄúThis was their ‚ÄòRosa Parks‚Äô moment when they could have stood for integrity and democracy‚Äù -- but failed the test. Green Party‚Äôs Margaret Flowers Challenges US Senate Debate in Maryland as Undemocratic by BAR editor and columnist, Dr. Marsha Adebayo 
‚Äú The corporate media and the political duopoly collaborated to ensure that the Green Party message would not be heard.‚Äù 
US corruption during this campaign season is on full display for the entire world to ponder. No one paying even scant attention can deny the thin veneer that is used to hide state sponsored police murder of Africans, structural poverty and the cozy relationship between the 1% rulers in the Democratic and Republican parties. Green Party candidates, such as Jill Stein, Ajamu Baraka and Margaret Flowers have forced sunlight‚Äôs disinfectant power to expose a rigged, racist and revolting political system that politically and economically devours communities of color, condones police murders of Black youth, intentionally exposes communities, like Flint, Michigan, to poisoned water, promotes drone warfare and the pilfering of the natural resources of Africa and South America. 
The system, however is finding it more difficult to block out the voices of dissent. Such was the situation this week at the University of Baltimore College of Public Affairs where Dr. Margaret Flowers, the Green Party candidate for the Maryland US Senate seat, was refused the opportunity to participate in the only televised debate alongside Democratic Congressman Chris Van Hollen and Republican state Del. Kathy Szeliga. The corporate media and the political duopoly collaborated to ensure that the Green Party message would not be heard. The sham excuse used to exclude Flowers was that her poll numbers had not reached 15%. But, of course it is difficult to reach the magic number of 15% in the polls when one is systematically excluded from debates and public events. This is the revolving rigged system that Black people know so well. 
‚ÄúWhen the police came to escort her off the stage neither candidate provided a meaningful protest of the anti-democratic process unfolding.‚Äù 
When the rigged debate started, audience members called for Dr. Flowers to join Van Hollen and Szeliga. Shouts of ‚Äúlet her speak‚Äù could be heard from the audience. Responding to the audience, Dr. Flowers took her place on the stage shaking hands with both candidates. Standing on the stage, she turned her attention to the audience and said: 
‚ÄúI think it‚Äôs important for voters to understand the differences between myself and Congressman Van Hollen and Delegate Szeliga.‚Äù With the police moving on stage to remove her, she said, ‚Ä¶‚ÄùI mean, you say you‚Äôre a public university and you want to educate the public, but without having a full public discussion, that doesn't actually happen.‚Äù 
While Van Hollen and Szeliga seemed to agree with Dr. Flowers participating in the debate, when the police came to escort her off the stage neither candidate provided a meaningful protest of the anti-democratic process unfolding. Delegate Szeliga noted that a third podium was available but both politicians remained silent while Dr. Flowers was forced to leave the stage. This was their ‚ÄúRosa Parks‚Äù moment when they could have stood for integrity and democracy but Van Hollen and Szeliga, failed to show the smallest amount of courage, leadership and commitment to anything greater than their individual ambitions and desire for power. 
Margaret was escorted by police to a sidewalk outside the debate hall and that symbolically represents the state of US democracy. 
After church on Sunday, a sister said to me, ‚ÄúI know a lot of Black folks are going to vote for Hilary Clinton but I can‚Äôt vote for the lesser of two evils. I‚Äôve decided to vote for Jill Stein. I‚Äôm going to vote my conscience!‚Äù My only response after agreeing with her analysis was to add, ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt forget to also vote for Margaret Flowers.‚Äú

"Break the Silence or Support Self-Determination? In Syria, the Answer Should be Obvious","Break the Silence or Support Self-Determination? In Syria, the Answer Should be Obvious Submitted by Danny Haiphong on Tue, 11/01/2016 - 19:14 Tweet Widget by Danny Haiphong 
Syria is ‚Äúthe target of one of the greatest misinformation campaigns in recent history.‚Äù The author regrets that left analyst Eric Draitser has contributed to the confusion. Draitser criticizes leftists who firmly support the Syrian government. Danny Haiphong counters that ‚Äúthe left must act with uncompromising dedication to the principle of self-determination in every case where US and Western imperialism wages wars of neo-colonial plunder.‚Äù Break the Silence or Support Self-Determination? In Syria, the Answer Should be Obvious by Danny Haiphong 
‚ÄúTo claim that the left in the US should fight for ‚Äòpeace‚Äô and at the same time oppose the Syrian government is an intentional attempt to remain neutral in a time of war.‚Äù 
Imperialism's war on Syria may be the most important question on the order of the day for those fighting for a world free of exploitation and oppression. Syria is currently the battleground of imperialism's last gasp of life. In nearly six years, Syria has been turned into a site of intense struggle between the forces of resistance and imperialism's forces of reaction. It has also been the target of one of the greatest misinformation campaigns in recent history. The imperialist countries and their media lackeys have sewed deep confusion about the true character of the war being waged on Syria. Nowhere is this confusion greater than in the United States, and it appears someone I deeply respect has been overtaken by it. 
In a recent issue of CounterPunch, Eric Draitser dives head deep into the confusion . He criticizes what he deems as two critical problems with the left's stance. Draitser first criticizes the pro-imperialist left for their decision to align themselves with the foreign-sponsored terror groups in Syria, which have been labeled ""revolutionaries"" or ""rebels"" by the imperialist countries. He then goes on to criticize leftists who have positioned themselves firmly in support of the Syrian government. 
It is his criticism of the ""pro-Assad left"" that needs further examination. Draitser reveals his deep confusion when he asks: 
""Will you continue to delude yourselves by refusing to accept the plainly obvious truth that no state or group has the best interests of Syrians at heart?"" 
Draitser's question assumes that the Syrian and Russian governments are equally to blame for the chaos in Syria. Their bombs are assumed to be prolonging the war and committing atrocities against the Syrian people at the same rate of the imperialists. If this is not the case, he doesn't state otherwise in the piece. In fact, Draitser sets out to prove true what has already been proven false by a wide range of independent and corporate media sources. 
‚ÄúThe imperialist countries and their media lackeys have sewed deep confusion about the true character of the war being waged on Syria.‚Äù 
First, Draitser claims that the war on Syria began as a genuine protest against ""neo-liberal"" reforms instituted by the Syrian government. This narrative is popular among the liberal-left media as well as the white left generally. However, those who make this claim rarely specify what neo-liberal reforms were made or how the confrontation all of a sudden became violent. Stephen Gowans reviews numerous reports from the corporate media that describe the uprising in March of 2011 as immediately violent, ill-supported, and ultimately insignificant in the midst of reforms from the Syrian government that were broadly supported by the Syrian people. At the same time as the violent uprisings, thousands of Syrians were protesting in the streets in support of President Assad. 
Furthermore, reports from the city of Daraa during the 2011 uprisings confirmed the presence of armed ""rebels"" who had freshly arrived from their US-NATO backed destruction of Libya . These ""rebels"" have since infested the country through various channels of the Syrian border. Each group possesses a fundamentalist Wahhabi ideology and receives varying degrees of assistance from the Gulf monarchies, Israel, Turkey, NATO, and of course, the US. This is confirmed in Draitser's article. Yet he still reinforces the claim that a popular uprising started the war even though Assad possessed broad support in 2011 . 
The truth is that the war on Syria has little to do with neo-liberalism or popular discontent. It has been acknowledged by UN sources that despite reforms, the Syrian economy remains highly regulated and socialist in character . Syria's own form of socialism has brought many benefits to the Syrian people. Healthcare and education are rights guaranteed to all citizens . Syria also possesses a secular government where Muslims, Christians, and all religious and ethnic groups lived peacefully prior to the war. Syria is thus a poor example of neo-liberalism. What economic struggles that do exist in Syria have largely stemmed from the harsh sanctions imposed by the US in 2004. 
‚ÄúThe war on Syria has little to do with neo-liberalism or popular discontent.‚Äù 
Furthermore, Draitser cites numerous sources that support regime change to smear the Syrian government and, by extension, the Syrian people. One of the sources receives much of its information from the White Helmets. The White Helmets have long been exposed as an NGO that works directly in service of imperialism's regime change operation in Syria. The organization receives approximately 33 million in funds directly from the US and UK governments. Eva Bartlett recently visited Aleppo and witnessed many White Helmet workers sporting arms and fighting among the terror groups . 
Draister also cites a source from the New York Post . The Post article relies heavily on documents collected by the dubious Center for International Justice and Accountability. This purported ""international law"" NGO is run by a consortium of corporate lawyers, former or current Amnesty International staffers, and various other servants of empire. The organization specializes in ""transitional justice."" In other words, the Center for International Justice and Accountability (CIJA) provides a legal framework for regime change on behalf of its imperial funders. Draitser claims no group involved in the war has the interests of the Syrian people at heart yet cites directly from an organization dedicated to the promotion of war in Syria. 
The NGOs and their partners in the corporate media have worked together to distort the reality on the ground. Aleppo is case and point. A ceasefire was brokered by all parties in late October that was supposed to allow Syrians to escape safely from East to West Aleppo. However, the humanitarian corridors were repeatedly shelled by the Nusra Front , the US-backed Al Qaeda affiliate . The media decided to ignore this and report instead that the ceasefire‚Äôs failure was due to the withholding of aid by Russia and Syria . This is but one example of many where the Syrian government has been blamed for the rebel-sponsored terror inflicted on Syrian people. 
‚ÄúHis analysis uses an abstract, moral argument to violate Syria's self-determination.‚Äù 
After five years of war on Syria, it is a wonder how anyone could believe a word that comes from the mouths of the imperialist countries. They lied about the origins of the conflict. They have continuously blamed the Syrian government for events that have all been traced back to the armed proxies they support. This includes the Houla Massacre , the sarin gas attack in Ghouta, and the so-called starvation of Madaya . Aleppo is no different. The Syrian city has been under constant siege from NATO-backed terrorists. The terrorists are holding nearly 250,000 Syrians hostage in the Eastern side of war-torn Aleppo. This has been verified by journalists on the ground such as Vanessa Beeley . 
These facts seem not to matter in Draitser's newfound assessment of Syria. His analysis uses an abstract, moral argument to violate Syria's self-determination. Calling those who unequivocally support the Syrian government ""fetishists"" assumes that the US left should take a position different from that of the Syrian people. Actual Syrians supported Bashar Al-Assad, and thus the Syrian Army, with 88.7 percent of the vote in the 2014 elections. To claim that the left in the US should fight for ""peace"" and at the same time oppose the Syrian government is an intentional attempt to remain neutral in a time of war. As Howard Zinn brilliantly stated, one cannot be neutral on a moving train. 
And the imperialist war against Syria is moving dangerously toward a World War III scenario. Hillary Clinton will be elected the next President of the United States and has repeatedly expressed that she will pursue a no-fly zone once in office. A no-fly zone would place Russian and Syrian military assets at risk of US-sponsored bombs and thus the world at risk of a global military confrontation not seen since World War II. How convenient it is then that Draitser should rebuke his former anti-imperialist stance in place of a stealth form of regime change. The world is on fire, yet Draitser has interpreted the situation as a chance to distort an already highly misunderstood situation . 
‚ÄúDraister's conclusions ultimately reinforce the Western assumption that the left must come to the rescue and save the Syrian people from their plight.‚Äù 
Positions such as Draitser‚Äôs are ultimately shaped by the material conditions of an imperialist empire in crisis and decline. White supremacy has been a principle condition of US imperialism since its inception. The war machine and white supremacy are deeply connected. The peoples and nations on imperialism's hit-list are routinely depicted in a manner that justifies the need for US and Western military medicine. This notion has trickled down to the day-to-day actions of ordinary people, including what currently passes as the ""anti-war"" movement in the US today. 
Draister's conclusions ultimately reinforce the Western assumption that the left must come to the rescue and save the Syrian people from their plight. Indeed, the Syrian people need allies and the left must be organizing toward an end to the war. But an end to the war cannot be achieved unless the left supports the will of the Syrian people. At the moment, this means the US left must align itself with the Syrian government and its allies. The left must act with uncompromising dedication to the principle of self-determination in every case where US and Western imperialism wages wars of neo-colonial plunder. Syria should be no exception. 
Of course, this critique should not be seen as a personal attack on Draitser himself. His body of work reflects a deep commitment to the struggle against war and Empire. He has often taken positions on international questions that are deeply unpopular with the US imperialist order. However, when mistakes are made, the left has a responsibility to correct them. There is too much at stake. Failure to step up in defense of Syria means another regime, change scenario similar to what happened in Yugoslavia, Iraq, and Libya. Draitser's piece is a study into the path that all genuine anti-imperialists should avoid. 
But what is the correct path forward? Imperialism is the unquestionable cause of the war in Syria, so imperialism must be the primary target of an anti-imperialist movement. The US and its allies are risking world war over Syria‚Äôs destruction. On the other side, the Syrian and Russian governments (along with Iran and China) are doing as much as they can to find a peaceful solution to the conflict that also respects Syria‚Äôs national sovereignty. It is without question that this is the side where the left ought to be in the continued struggle to end the war once and for all.

"‚ÄúWhen You Speak Up for the MOVE 9, You Speak Up for Yourself‚Äù","Tweet Widget by MOVE People 
The Philadelphia-based MOVE family was horribly victimized by police in 1978 and 1985. The first atrocity led to the mass imprisonment of MOVE members; the second assault killed five adults and six children and burned down a city block. No cops have ever been punished, but the MOVE 9 remain in prison, and were this year once again denied parole. ‚ÄúThey couldn't kill us that day, so they are trying to finish the job in these prisons.‚Äù ‚ÄúWhen You Speak Up for the MOVE 9, You Speak Up for Yourself‚Äù by MOVE People 
This article previously appeared on Move 9 blogspot . 
‚ÄúThe District Attorney never proved MOVE had killed a police officer.‚Äù 
The MOVE 9 Have been eligible for Parole since August 2008, After being in prison for 30 years. We have repeatedly been denied. In June of this year (2016) , we were denied parole again , for a total of ten years past the time we should have been released. One of the reasons the parole board gave to justify not releasing us is that we are a threat to the safety of the community. This is not true. People are not afraid of MOVE People. Move People ain't strangling people to death, shooting people in the back. It ain't MOVE that killed a man in front of his fianc√© and four year old child. MOVE is not drive by shooting, or terrorizing folks in the community. It's the community who is faxing, emailing, and calling the parole board asking for our release on parole. 
It is the Parole Board and D.A. John Straub who continue to deny our release for no valid reason. On August 8th 1978, hundreds of cops attacked our home at 3:00am in the morning trying to kill us. They couldn't kill us that day, so they are trying to finish the job in these prisons but understand: John Straub and the Parole Board are not justified. MOVE did not go out to the Police's house to do them harm. The Cops came to our house, because a judge sent them to our house to serve bench warrants for not appearing in court not for rape, murder, kidnapping or abuse but for not appearing in court for a civil matter. Understand this: hundreds of cops were sent to our home, while we were asleep, dressed in swat gear, armed with all type of weaponry, semi -automatic weapons, fire fighters, smoke bombs, tear gas, a deluge gun, a crane and a bulldozer to serve bench warrants, for a housing code violation. 
‚ÄúMove People ain't strangling people to death, shooting people in the back.‚Äù 
It was the Police who came to Move‚Äôs premises. They came armed to the teeth and in their frenzy to kill MOVE, they killed one of their own, and condemned us for it. We are not making this up. The evidence is clear. 
The whole world witnessed the attack on the MOVE house May 13th 1985, where the house was bombed into a blazing inferno, the six adults were shot and killed and the five children were shot back into the house by police as they tried to escape the burning flames where they died . These are proven Facts. During the city‚Äôs investigation hearing, it was ruled that the cops used excessive force and the killings were wrongful deaths. Those children were our children in that house that day, yet not one cop or official connected to the bombing of our family were held accountable, responsible for these deaths like the parole board is telling The MOVE 9 we have to take responsibility for a crime when the District Attorney never proved MOVE had killed a police officer. 
We have no weapons charges and the judge admitted on public radio to the caller, Mumia Abu Jamal [a radio journalist at the time], that he didn't have the faintest idea who shot the police officer. It's a fact that world renowned forensic experts Dr. Ali Hameli and Claus Speth ruled the deaths of the children HOMICIDES in a scathing report against the city, submitted to the assistant District Attorney Joan Weimer, but the grand jury did nothing. 
‚ÄúIt's time for everybody to start speaking freely in protest of all this free wheeling injustice.‚Äù 
The Move 9 have spent almost 40 years in prison for killing a cop, with no real proof. The whole world saw the Philadelphia police murder our children and family, and they have not spent a day in prison for it. But, what is the difference in these lives? Does a MOVE child not bleed, when they are shot? Does a MOVE parent not feel pain when their baby is killed, just because they are not cops or officials? Does the murder of a MOVE child, the pain of MOVE parent, the heartache of a black person's suffering still fall on deaf ears like the slaves who cried out when their babies, women and men were sold, killed, and whipped by slave owners? Ask yourself. Things may seem to have changed since those awful days, but the mentality is still very much existing. 
Just look around and listen. Black lives (Don't) Matter. That's why these cops are getting away with killing Black Men, Women, and Children. That's why The MOVE 9 are still in prison almost 40 years for killing a cop, and the cops responsible for killing 11 MOVE people, five of them children, are walking around like they are clean and without guilt. It's the mentality that makes them feel nothing after killing people. Because to them MOVE lives (Don't) matter. It's time for everybody to start speaking freely in protest of all this free wheeling injustice. People must understand this necessity of speaking out now. 
We are asking for people to sign The Petition we have aimed at United States Attorney General Loretta Lynch demanding that The United States Justice Dept open up an investigation into the ongoing and wrongful imprisonment of The MOVE 9. People can sign the petition at Https://causes.com/92454-free-the-move-9 . Speak out with the understanding that when speaking of MOVE, you are speaking up for yourself. It can't get better for MOVE without getting better for you. 
Looking Forward To The May 2017 MOVE Conference In Philadelphia.

LesserOfTwoEvilism,"2016 presidential campaign by Matt Sedillo 
Hillary Clinton is, no doubt, a threat to life on Earth. But the duopoly electoral system is a menagerie of warmongers. ‚ÄúThe response to the white nationalism of Donald Trump has been the rainbow coalition of hawks.‚Äù Barack Obama has proven an awesomely prolific war maker. Bernie Sanders is no peacenik. ‚ÄúIt is only the white nationalist orange demon -- guided only by his own whims and twitter feuds -- that is at all off script on this question.‚Äù LesserOfTwoEvilism by Matt Sedillo 
‚Äú So long as there is a ruling class they shall rule by fire and blood.‚Äù 
The loathsome and shameless hypocrisy of the Democratic Party and the doctrine of lesseroftwoevilism has been laid bare this political season. This same Democratic Party that unquestionably rigged the primaries against the left-leaning Bernie Sanders campaign is now selling itself to the public as the savior of the downtrodden from the threat of an uber right wing candidate. 
Hillary Clinton at this point in her election run appears to be making no promises to the public other than to not to physically morph into Donald Trump during her coronation come Election Day. 
Lesseroftwoevilism is a bankrupt political ideology and the means by which the Democratic Party deadens any inkling towards decency or rational self interest that may lay dormant in the American electorate. Hillary Clinton and the Democratic Party intend to use the platform of ""at least not being Donald Trump"" to install the most despised Democratic candidate in a generation into the White House. 
It is indeed horrifying that a straight up eugenicist billionaire who brags about sexual assaulting women won the Republican primary. It is terrifying that the cult leader of a white nationalist zombie apocalypse has gotten this far through the electoral process. 
‚ÄúThere is no greater threat to the future of much of life on the planet than Hillary Clinton.‚Äù 
The country is polarizing and it is terrifying to see that much of it is polarizing in the direction of Donald Trump whose campaign is defined by phrases like ‚ÄúMake America Great Again‚Äù quickly followed by ‚ÄúMexico Will Pay.‚Äù Much of the country is also polarized in the direction of Bernie Sanders. It was the political apparatus of the Democratic Party, not the Republicans, that prevented these two competing visions from standing before the American public. 
Setting aside the fact, for a moment, that we don't live in a democracy, it must be noted that lesseroftwoevilism in American politics is an ideology by Americans for Americans. Hillary Clinton, Donald Trump, AND Bernie Sanders are all advocates of the US war machine. If any of these three warlords were to sit in the seat of power children in far off lands would still be bombed in their sleep and be reported on as collateral damage. 
Hillary Clinton is the most bloodthirsty advocate for murder and mayhem in a political system that thrives upon such practices. When it comes to dropping bombs, obliterating nations or possibly igniting a nuclear winter there is no greater threat to the future of much of life on the planet than Hillary Clinton. 
Rainbow Coalition of Hawks 
Far beyond a ‚Äúbasket of deplorables,‚Äù the 2016 Republican national convention was a ghastly horror show of the most reactionary, bigoted elements of American political culture. Less than esteemed actor Scott Baio captured the mood when he proclaimed, ‚Äúso of course let‚Äôs make America great again, but let‚Äôs make America America again.‚Äù That largely captured the theme of the proceedings and most speeches were some variation upon that theme. 
The Democrats in response sought to make their convention a big tent of peoples, ideas and movements. And indeed from the spontaneous chants of ‚Äúblack lives matter‚Äù to Tim Kaine leading a chant of ‚Äúsi se puede‚Äù to Eva Longoria reminding the audience ‚Äúwe didn‚Äôt cross the borders the borders crossed us‚Äù to Michelle Obama letting the thousands in attendance and the millions watching at home know that slave labor built the White House and the country, from Sebastian De La Cruz singing the national anthem in full mariachi garb to the Khan family holding a copy of the Constitution, the Democratic National Convention did present itself as a stark contrast to what the GOP was offering. 
The theme of inclusion ran high and, indeed, current president Barack Obama made his call for strength in unity, explicitly saying ‚ÄúAnd most of all I see Americans of every party, every background, every faith who believe we are stronger together, black white, Latino, Asian, Native American, young, old, gay, straight, men, women, folks with different abilities, all pledging allegiance, under the same proud flag, to this big bold country that we love.‚Äù One flag to rule them all. 
‚ÄúAmerica the greatest and most diverse nation on Earth shall ransack the globe as it sees fit. ‚Äù 
General John Allen, standing before a multi ethnic group of people continued upon this theme and made the connection between a more inclusive union and explicit projection of American might 
‚ÄúEvery American, in uniform or out, in the White House or at home, must be a force for unity in America, for a vision that includes all of us: every man and woman, every race, every ethnicity, every faith and creed, every gender orientation ‚Äì all of us together pursuing our common values. 
‚ÄúFrom the battlefield to the capitals of our allies, friends, and partners, the free peoples of the world look to America as the last best hope for peace and for liberty for all humanity, for we ARE the greatest country on this planet. 
‚ÄúSo we stand before you tonight to endorse Hillary Clinton for President of the United States of America.‚Äù 
The message could not be clearer. Sorry Donald Trump, we are all Americans here. No apologies rest of the world, America the greatest and most diverse nation on Earth shall ransack the globe as it sees fit. 
The response to the white nationalism of Donald Trump has been the rainbow coalition of hawks as chiefly embodied in the persons of Barrack Obama and Hillary Clinton. 
Hillary Clinton: The Obliterator of Nations 
Hillary Clinton is a war criminal. So is John Kerry. So is Condoleezza Rice. So are Colin Powell and Madeleine Albright. The secretary of state in an imperialist nation is the immediate manager of the projected might of the empire they represent. 
Hillary Clinton is known to be a war hawk for much the same reason Donald Trump is known as a white nationalist. She is blatant and crass about it. 
‚ÄúWe came. We saw. He died‚Äù ‚Äì Hillary Clinton on the assassination of Ghadaffi 
‚ÄúIn the next 10 years, during which they might foolishly consider launching an attack on Israel, we would be able to totally obliterate them‚Äù ‚Äì Hillary Clinton speaking of obliteration of 75 million Iranians. 
For much of the past few months the Clinton campaign have bemoaned a Russian conspiracy to reveal the words that Hillary Clinton actually wrote and thereby influence the American election. 
Hillary Clinton‚Äôs neo-Mcarthyite cold war against her own words and general war talk on Russia should come as no surprise to anyone paying any attention. She was hawkish on Russia in their land dispute with Georgia over Ossetia, even going so far as to arm the Georgian government in 2010 less than two years after the conflict. She was warlike on the conflict in the Ukraine, promising Ukrainian government officials as recent as September of this year to stand with them against ‚ÄúRussian aggression.‚Äù 
‚ÄúA Clinton presidency is the will of the ruling class.‚Äù 
This is the talk of someone prepared for a nuclear apocalypse. 
It should be mentioned, however, that Obama has also dialed up his anti Russian rhetoric, as has Tim Kaine, as has Mike Pence. It is only the white nationalist orange demon -- guided only by his own whims and twitter feuds -- that is at all off script on this question. 
Ultimately a Clinton presidency is the will of the ruling class. If she wants war it is a reflection of their desire for war. If they want the bombs to fall then death will rain from the sky. So long as they hold power they shall exercise it. So long as there is a ruling class they shall rule by fire and blood, because there truly is no alternative. Because ultimately, this is about Clinton and then again it isn‚Äôt. And this is about the Democrats and then again it isn‚Äôt. This is about the US and this is about war. Hillary Clinton is a 2016 warlord. War is a racket. And so is this God damn election. Matt Sedillo can be contacted at [email protected] .",1
Realities Faced by Black Canadians are a National Shame,"Tweet Widget by Robyn Maynard 
Canada, including its French-speaking regions, is home to much the same kind of systemic racism as its southern neighbor, according to a United Nations Working Group report. Black women‚Äôs poverty rates are ‚Äúalmost five times higher than that of white Canadian women.‚Äù In Montreal, ‚Äúa 2008 study found that black girls are three times more likely than white girls the same age to have been arrested two times or more.‚Äù Realities Faced by Black Canadians are a National Shame by Robyn Maynard 
This article previously appeared in the Montreal Gazette . 
‚Äú Black Montrealers continue to experience dehumanizing treatment across institutions.‚Äù 
After holding consultations in Quebec, Nova Scotia and Ontario last month, the United Nations Working Group on People of African Descent issued a statement that sheds light on realities, too-often invisible to most Canadians, that should be seen as a national shame. 
The group‚Äôs preliminary findings confirm what is already well known in Canada‚Äôs black communities: that systemic discrimination has subjected black people to racial profiling by law enforcement, soaring incarceration rates, disproportionate poverty and poor health, the over-apprehension of black children by child welfare agencies and lower graduation rates. Black women, they note, face a rate of poverty that is almost five times higher than that of white Canadian women, and are one of the fastest-growing groups in federal prisons. 
Underlying these injustices, the UN Working Group has made clear, is systemic racism. 
The UN is right to be concerned, and Montreal is by no means exempt from this criticism: Both its historical and contemporary realities are defined by a systemic anti-blackness that goes too frequently un-named. The enslavement of black (and indigenous) persons was not an uncommon practice in New France, and indeed was legal until 1834. The fact of slavery remains all around us: acclaimed art historian Charmaine Nelson reminds us that many present-day Montreal streets, buildings and institutions are named after white businessmen like James McGill and John Redpath who traded in plantation crops worked by slave labor. 
Enslavement may be over, but centuries later black Montrealers ‚Äî the largest visible minority in the city ‚Äî continue to experience dehumanizing treatment across institutions. A 2010 study by sociologists L√©onel Bernard and Christopher McAll found that it was over-surveillance, and not the rates of so-called ‚Äúblack crime,‚Äù that accounted for up to 60 per cent of the over-incarceration of black youth in Montreal. 
‚ÄúThe enslavement of black (and indigenous) persons was not an uncommon practice in New France, and indeed was legal until 1834.‚Äù 
A report commissioned by the Montreal police, leaked to La Presse, found that in St-Michel and Montr√©al-Nord, up to 40 per cent of black youth were stopped in 2006-2007, a rate that indicates a high degree of racial profiling by police officers. Much of this heightened policing was justified to the public as curbing ‚Äúgang activities,‚Äù when in reality, in 2009, only 1.6 per cent of crimes were gang related. High profile cases of police abuse of black Montrealers and alleged abuse continue to surface, including the recent case of Veckqueth Stevenson, a legally blind black man in his 50s, who has accused the police of using excessive force and unjustly arresting him, ironically, while he was at Nelson Mandela Park. 
Black women and girls are not exempt, though we hear even less about their experiences locally; the case of Majiza Philip, a black woman who says she had her arm broken by police in 2014, is one example, however. A 2008 study found that black girls in Montreal are three times more likely than white girls the same age to have been arrested two times or more. 
Beyond the criminal justice system, numerous studies have demonstrated that black children are apprehended from their homes by child welfare at alarming rates in Montreal, and this, too, can be attributed to racism. 
The UN Working group is not the first to point out these injustices, nor are they the only ones proposing solutions. Black Lives Matter-Toronto and other black activist groups in Toronto, Kingston, Ottawa, Vancouver and Montreal have been steadily mobilizing to address anti-black racism. Across cities, black communities have denounced, among other issues, the recent deaths of Abdirahman Abdi in Ottawa, and Bony Jean-Pierre in Montreal, both at the hands of police in 2016. 
If Canada intends to genuinely reckon with its still-living legacy of black enslavement, the injustices brought to light by the UN ‚Äî alongside those highlighted by black activists around the country ‚Äî need to be both addressed and redressed. Robyn Maynard is an activist and writer living in Montreal, author of the forthcoming book Policing Black Bodies (2017).",1
An Open Letter to Black South African Police Officers,"Tweet Widget by Black Power Front 
With students joining workers in revolt against South Africa‚Äôs neoliberal regime, young people are demanding to know why Black police are engaged in the same kind of repression that was previously used by white governments ‚Äúto systematically counter Black resistance?‚Äù In a letter to Black cops, activists note ‚Äúan increase and worrying pattern of anti-Black police violence.‚Äù An Open Letter to Black South African Police Officers by Black Power Front 
‚ÄúAs a Black Police Officer, you must understand that the struggles of Black workers and students are actually your struggles too.‚Äù 
Dear Black Police Officer, 
How are you today? Well, we hope. You may be wondering who we are, why we have decided to write to you and perhaps why we are addressing you as a ‚ÄúBlack Police Officer‚Äù -- as opposed to just saying ‚ÄúPolice Officer.‚Äù 
Who are we? We are the Black Power Front or BPF. We are a non-party political pro-Black platform which seeks to serve as an instrument to organize and collaborate with like-minded Black individuals and organizations, under a common program that provides practical responses to what is commonly understood as the Black Condition today. 
Why have we decided to write to you? First, given the nature of your work, it is not always easy to sit down with you and just talk about issues that affect our country and, in particular, the Black community. 
Second, like other members of the Black community, we in the BPF are deeply disturbed by the continued brutality of the police against Black workers and students -- particularly those who engage in legitimate protest action. And third, the BPF holds the view that, given where Black people find themselves economically, socially and otherwise today in relation to other racial groups, it is extremely urgent that like-minded Black groups and individuals (everywhere in the world) come together in exclusive spaces, and engage in constructive dialogue, with the view to find ways of getting Black people out of the quagmire they currently find themselves in. 
The anti-Black role of the police before 1994 
As members of the Black community, you would know that, in the Azanian (South Afrikan) context, from the 1400s onwards, various forms of colonial police structures were key instruments in enabling the European invaders to advance and bolster their evil agenda of slavery, colonization and land theft. It was these colonial police structures that were used to systematically counter Black resistance, through amongst others the capture, torture and in many cases beheading of our warrior ancestors such as uKumkani uHintsa, Kgosi Toto, Kgosi Galeshewe, uKumkani uStuurman and many other heroes and heroines of Black resistance. 
In the 20 th century, it was through these European colonial police structures that successive white supremacist regimes in Azania (South Afrika) were able to murder and torture our freedom fighters and ordinary Black people. They were directly responsible for the murder of our people in Sharpeville and Langa in 1960. The execution by hanging of martyrs like Vuyisile Mini and Solomon Mahlangu, in 1964 and 1979, respectively. 
It was the colonial European police who assassinated visionaries such as Onkgopotse Tiro and Steve Biko, in 1974 and 1977, respectively. It was them who murdered the young Zolile Petersen and Christopher Truter, during the student uprising of 1976. And it was them who ensured that many of our revered freedom fighters such as Kgalabi Masemola, Mangaliso Sobukwe, Lekoane Mothopeng, Pandelani Nefolovhodwe, Nkosi Molala, Muntu Myeza and many others, were banished to Robben Island. 
Even though it is often argued that the White Police Officers who were involved in these atrocities against Black people were acting under the orders of their superiors, the truth of the matter is that, at an individual and basic level, they knew that what they were doing to Black people was wrong, inhumane and unjustified. 
The anti-Black role of the police after 1994 
Given this painful history of centuries of systematic and state violence against Black people, the declaration of ‚Äúfreedom‚Äù on April 27, 1994, created a legitimate expectation on the part of many Black people that the type of wanton violence and naked brutality that the successive colonial white supremacist regimes unleashed on Black people would be a thing of the past. But to our horror, even after the declaration of ‚Äúfreedom‚Äù in 1994 and the installation of a government that is led by Black people we began to see an increase and worrying pattern of anti-Black police violence. 
This type of anti-Black police [U1] brutality was palpable in the killing of Andries Tatane, young Nqobile Nzuza, Mike Tshele, Lerato Seema, Osiah Rahube, Jan Rivombo and of course the brutal and targeted assassinations of Mgcineni ‚ÄúMambush‚Äù Noki and other Black workers in Marikana, in August 2012. 
All of these anti-Black atrocities beg the question: how it is possible that a government that is led by people who, as part of the Black community, have first-hand experience of the brutality of state violence through the police, do not just unleash the same type of state violence against their own people, but also seek to justify the use of such anti-Black violence? 
Our attitude towards Black police officers 
By highlighting the involvement of Black Policer Officers (after 1994) in the killing of ordinary Black people who are simply fighting for their right to be human the BPF does not seek to create the mind-set that Black Police Officers are the enemy of the Black community or that Black Police Officers are inherently bad people. Of course, there are many examples of Black Police Officers who don‚Äôt just do their job with integrity and dedication, but also do a lot of good work in the Black community. 
This notwithstanding, the main focus of this letter, however, is not so much the individual conduct of Black Police Officers but rather the continued use of Black Police Officers (as a state function) in the brutal suppression of the right of ordinary and mainly poor Black people to freely articulate their social, economic and political concerns and aspirations. 
Our appeal to Black police officers 
As the BPF, we regard Black Police Officers as members of the Black community first and therefore an integral part of Black life in Azania. We also hold the view that the on-going demands by Black workers for decent wages and better working conditions or those of Black students for free-decolonized-Afrocentric education, are not just demands that will benefit individual Black Police Officers (majority of them Black young people), but also their children who might be at university or will be going there in future. Therefore, as a Black Police Officer, you must understand that the struggles of Black workers and students are actually your struggles too. 
As the BPF we fully understand that, just like all ordinary Black people, Black Police Officers are under severe financial stress and like most Black people, they are struggling to make ends meet. For these reasons, the BPF‚Äôs clarion call to all Black Police Officers is as follows: 
* Understand that the economic struggles and frustrations of ordinary Black people are your struggles and frustrations too. And that Black workers and students continue to be oppressed by the same system that is responsible for your personal financial stress; 
* As part of the Black community, you must (through your labor unions), engage the management of the SAPS to stop the state‚Äôs campaign of apartheid-style violence that is currently being unleashed on Black people in general; 
* You are our Black Brothers and Sisters and must never allow yourselves to be used by self-serving politicians as part of an elitist anti-Black-pro-capitalist plot that uses the pretext of ‚Äúlaw and order‚Äù to justify the murder of poor Black people and wanting that Black people timidly accept their status as economic slaves in the land of their ancestors; and 
* Lastly, Black students and workers are not fighting against you (as Black police officers) but against the anti-Black-pro-capitalist system that is using some of you against your own Black Sisters and Brothers.

The Lords of Capital Sic Crazy Hillary on the World,"Tweet Widget A Black Agenda Radio commentary by executive editor Glen Ford 
The capitalist ruling class is frightened, for good reason: the empire cannot peacefully contain the rising economic powers of the South and East. ‚ÄúThe Lords of Capital know there is no future for them in a world where the dollar is not supreme and where Wall Street‚Äôs stocks, bonds and derivatives are not backed by the full weight of unchallenged empire.‚Äù War is the only card they have left to play ‚Äì and Hillary Clinton is their favored dealer. The Lords of Capital Sic Crazy Hillary on the World A Black Agenda Radio commentary by executive editor Glen Ford 
‚ÄúThe Lords of Capital are creatures of U.S. imperial dominance; they go out of business when the empire does.‚Äù 
By virtually every measurement, the United States is in deep crisis, as both a society and as the headquarters of global capitalism. We can roughly measure the severity of some aspects of the crisis with the tools of economic analysis. Such an analysis is quite useful in explaining why Washington is so eager to risk war with Russia and China, whether in Syria or the South China Sea or along the ever expanding borders of NATO. To put it simply, the U.S. and western Europe become smaller, in terms of their economic influence, with every passing day, and cannot possibly maintain their political dominance in the world except by military force, coercion and terror. Those are the only cards the imperialists have left to play. The ruling circles in the U.S. are aware that time is not on their side, and it makes them crazy -- or crazier than usual. 
The ruling class‚Äôs own analysts tell them that the center of the world economy is moving inexorably to the East and the South; that this trend will continue for the foreseeable future; and that the U.S. is already number two by some economic measures -- and dropping. The Lords of Capital know there is no future for them in a world where the dollar is not supreme and where Wall Street‚Äôs stocks, bonds and derivatives are not backed by the full weight of unchallenged empire. Put another way, U.S. imperialism is at an inflection point, with all the indicators pointing downward and no hope of reversing the trend by peaceful means. 
Now, that‚Äôs actually not such a bad prognosis for the United States, as a country. The U.S. is a big country, with an abundance of human and natural resources, and would do just fine in a world among equals. But, the fate of the Lords of Capital is tied to the ongoing existence of empire. They create nothing, but seek to monetize and turn a profit on everything. They cannot succeed in trade unless it is rigged, and have placed bets in their casinos that are nominally seven times more valuable than the total economic activity of planet Earth. In short, the Lords of Capital are creatures of U.S. imperial dominance; they go out of business when the empire does. 
Beat the Clock 
The rulers are looking class death in the face -- and it terrifies them. And when the Lords of Capital become frightened, they order their servants in politics and the war industries and the vast national security networks to take care of the problem, by any means necessary. That means militarily encircling Russia and China; arming and mobilizing tens of thousands of jihadist terrorists in Syria, in an attempt to repeat the regime change in Libya; waging a war of economic sanctions and low-level armed aggression against Iran; occupying most of the African continent through subversion of African militaries; escalating subversion in Latin America; and spying on everyone on earth with a digital connection. All this, to stop the clock that is ticking on U.S. and European world economic dominance. 
Left political analysts that I greatly respect argue that Hillary Clinton and the mob she will come in with in January will pull back from apocalyptic confrontation with Russia in Syria -- that they‚Äôre not really that crazy. But, I‚Äôm not at all convinced. The ruling class isn‚Äôt just imagining that their days are numbered; it‚Äôs really true. And rulers do get crazy when their class is standing at death‚Äôs door.

Freedom Rider: Russophobia: War Party Propaganda,"Tweet Widget b y BAR editor and senior columnist Margaret Kimberley 
The world‚Äôs most reactionary regime, the head-chopping, terror-sponsoring Saudi Arabian kleptocracy, was awarded the chair of the UN Human Rights Council, while Russia has been kicked out. The travesty was engineered by the Superpower of Lies to punish Moscow for resisting the U.S.-led war of sectarian massacre and regime change in Syria. The War Party is on the march, to the cheers of corporate media ‚Äì and Hillary hasn‚Äôt even been elected yet. Freedom Rider : Russophobia: War Party Propaganda b y BAR editor and senior columnist Margaret Kimberley 
‚Äú All attempts to stop the fighting were rejected by the U.S. and NATO and sealed the fate of the Syrian people.‚Äù 
Did Russia invade Iraq and kill one million people? Does Russia have a greater percentage of its population behind bars than any other country in the world? Did Russia occupy Haiti after kidnapping its president? Are Russian police allowed to shoot children to death without fear of repercussion? Is Russia entering its 20 th year of a terror war against the people of Somalia? All of these crimes take place in or at the direction of the United States. Yet the full force of propaganda and influence on world opinion is directed against Russia, which whatever its shortcomings cannot hold a candle to America in violating human rights. 
The dangers presented by a Hillary Clinton presidency cannot be overstated. She and the war party have been steadily working towards a goal that defies logic and risks all life on earth. Regime change is once again their modus operandi and they hope to make it a reality against Russia. 
Nearly every claim of Russian evil doing is a lie, a ruse meant to put Americans in a fighting mood and lose their fear of nuclear conflagration. It isn‚Äôt clear if Clinton and the rest of the would-be warriors actually realize they are risking mushroom clouds. Perhaps they believe that Vladimir Putin will be easily pushed around when all evidence points to the contrary. 
‚Äú Regime change is once again their modus operandi and they hope to make it a reality against Russia.‚Äù 
The unproven allegations of interference in the presidential election and casting blame on Russia as the sole cause of suffering in Syria are meant to desensitize the public. It is an age old ploy which makes war not just acceptable but deemed a necessity. The usual suspects are helping out eagerly. The corporate media, led by newspapers like the New York Times and Washington Post , are front and center in pushing tales of Russian villainy. Human Rights Watch and other organizations who care nothing about abuses committed by the United States and its allies are also playing their usual role of choosing the next regime change victim. 
Russia lost its seat on the United Nations Human Rights Council in part because of American pressure and public relations assistance from the human rights industrial complex. The UNHRC is now chaired by Saudi Arabia. Saudi Arabia is an absolute monarchy that funds the jihadist terrorist groups who caused 500,000 Syrian deaths. The Saudis are causing dislocation, death and starvation in Yemen, too, but they are American allies, so there is little opposition to their misdeeds. 
The openly bigoted Donald Trump has been the perfect foil for Hillary Clinton. That is why she and the rest of the Democratic Party leadership preferred him as their rival. He made the case for the discredited lesser evilism argument and his sensible statements about avoiding enmity with Russia made him even more useful. 
‚Äú Newspapers like the New York Times and Washington Post, are front and center in pushing tales of Russian villainy.‚Äù 
The United States and its allies are the cause of Syria‚Äôs destruction. Their effort to overthrow president Assad created a humanitarian disaster complete with ISIS and al Nusra fighters who love to chop off heads for entertainment. Far from being the cause of the catastrophe Russia left its ally to fight alone for four years. They even made overtures to negotiate Assad‚Äôs fate with the United States. All attempts to stop the fighting were rejected by the U.S. and NATO and sealed the fate of the Syrian people. The people of east Aleppo are being shelled by American allies but one wouldn‚Äôt know that by reading what passes for journalism in newspapers and on television. The American role in the slaughter is barely mentioned or is excused as an effort to protect the civilian population. The bloodshed was made in the U.S. and could end if this government wanted it to. 
The anti-Russian propaganda effort has worked to perfection. NATO is massing troops on Russia‚Äôs borders in a clear provocation yet Putin is labeled the bad guy. He is said to be menacing the countries that join in threatening his nation. The United States makes phony claims of Russian war crimes despite having blood on its hands. The latest Human Rights Watch canards about prosecuting Assad come straight from the White House and State Department and have nothing to do with concern for Syrians living in their fifth year of hell. 
‚ÄúDonald Trump has been the perfect foil for Hillary Clinton.‚Äù 
There is no lesser evil between Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump. She is fully supported by the war party in her desire for a more ‚Äúmuscular‚Äù foreign policy. That bizarre term means death and starvation for millions more people if Clinton wins in a landslide. She must be denied a victory of that magnitude and any opportunity to claim a mandate. Peace loving people must give their votes to the Green Party ticket of Jill Stein and Ajamu Baraka. They are alone in rejecting the premise of an imperialist country and its endless wars. 
The United States is the most dangerous country in the world. If it has a reckless and war loving president the threat becomes existential. That is the prospect we face with a Hillary Clinton presidency. If the role of villain is cast on the world stage she is the star of the show.

Green Party‚Äôs Margaret Flowers Challenges US Senate Debate in Maryland as Undemocratic,"2016 elections by BAR editor and columnist, Dr. Marsha Adebayo 
The ‚Äúrevolving, rigged system‚Äù that purports to be American democracy was revealed in all its corporate vulgarity on a Baltimore university stage, last week. Two U.S. Senate candidates of the duopoly parties pretended to support the Green Party‚Äôs candidate‚Äôs right to join the debate, but failed to protest when cops hauled her away. ‚ÄúThis was their ‚ÄòRosa Parks‚Äô moment when they could have stood for integrity and democracy‚Äù -- but failed the test. Green Party‚Äôs Margaret Flowers Challenges US Senate Debate in Maryland as Undemocratic by BAR editor and columnist, Dr. Marsha Adebayo 
‚Äú The corporate media and the political duopoly collaborated to ensure that the Green Party message would not be heard.‚Äù 
US corruption during this campaign season is on full display for the entire world to ponder. No one paying even scant attention can deny the thin veneer that is used to hide state sponsored police murder of Africans, structural poverty and the cozy relationship between the 1% rulers in the Democratic and Republican parties. Green Party candidates, such as Jill Stein, Ajamu Baraka and Margaret Flowers have forced sunlight‚Äôs disinfectant power to expose a rigged, racist and revolting political system that politically and economically devours communities of color, condones police murders of Black youth, intentionally exposes communities, like Flint, Michigan, to poisoned water, promotes drone warfare and the pilfering of the natural resources of Africa and South America. 
The system, however is finding it more difficult to block out the voices of dissent. Such was the situation this week at the University of Baltimore College of Public Affairs where Dr. Margaret Flowers, the Green Party candidate for the Maryland US Senate seat, was refused the opportunity to participate in the only televised debate alongside Democratic Congressman Chris Van Hollen and Republican state Del. Kathy Szeliga. The corporate media and the political duopoly collaborated to ensure that the Green Party message would not be heard. The sham excuse used to exclude Flowers was that her poll numbers had not reached 15%. But, of course it is difficult to reach the magic number of 15% in the polls when one is systematically excluded from debates and public events. This is the revolving rigged system that Black people know so well. 
‚ÄúWhen the police came to escort her off the stage neither candidate provided a meaningful protest of the anti-democratic process unfolding.‚Äù 
When the rigged debate started, audience members called for Dr. Flowers to join Van Hollen and Szeliga. Shouts of ‚Äúlet her speak‚Äù could be heard from the audience. Responding to the audience, Dr. Flowers took her place on the stage shaking hands with both candidates. Standing on the stage, she turned her attention to the audience and said: 
‚ÄúI think it‚Äôs important for voters to understand the differences between myself and Congressman Van Hollen and Delegate Szeliga.‚Äù With the police moving on stage to remove her, she said, ‚Ä¶‚ÄùI mean, you say you‚Äôre a public university and you want to educate the public, but without having a full public discussion, that doesn't actually happen.‚Äù 
While Van Hollen and Szeliga seemed to agree with Dr. Flowers participating in the debate, when the police came to escort her off the stage neither candidate provided a meaningful protest of the anti-democratic process unfolding. Delegate Szeliga noted that a third podium was available but both politicians remained silent while Dr. Flowers was forced to leave the stage. This was their ‚ÄúRosa Parks‚Äù moment when they could have stood for integrity and democracy but Van Hollen and Szeliga, failed to show the smallest amount of courage, leadership and commitment to anything greater than their individual ambitions and desire for power. 
Margaret was escorted by police to a sidewalk outside the debate hall and that symbolically represents the state of US democracy. 
After church on Sunday, a sister said to me, ‚ÄúI know a lot of Black folks are going to vote for Hilary Clinton but I can‚Äôt vote for the lesser of two evils. I‚Äôve decided to vote for Jill Stein. I‚Äôm going to vote my conscience!‚Äù My only response after agreeing with her analysis was to add, ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt forget to also vote for Margaret Flowers.‚Äú

"Break the Silence or Support Self-Determination? In Syria, the Answer Should be Obvious","Break the Silence or Support Self-Determination? In Syria, the Answer Should be Obvious Submitted by Danny Haiphong on Tue, 11/01/2016 - 19:14 Tweet Widget by Danny Haiphong 
Syria is ‚Äúthe target of one of the greatest misinformation campaigns in recent history.‚Äù The author regrets that left analyst Eric Draitser has contributed to the confusion. Draitser criticizes leftists who firmly support the Syrian government. Danny Haiphong counters that ‚Äúthe left must act with uncompromising dedication to the principle of self-determination in every case where US and Western imperialism wages wars of neo-colonial plunder.‚Äù Break the Silence or Support Self-Determination? In Syria, the Answer Should be Obvious by Danny Haiphong 
‚ÄúTo claim that the left in the US should fight for ‚Äòpeace‚Äô and at the same time oppose the Syrian government is an intentional attempt to remain neutral in a time of war.‚Äù 
Imperialism's war on Syria may be the most important question on the order of the day for those fighting for a world free of exploitation and oppression. Syria is currently the battleground of imperialism's last gasp of life. In nearly six years, Syria has been turned into a site of intense struggle between the forces of resistance and imperialism's forces of reaction. It has also been the target of one of the greatest misinformation campaigns in recent history. The imperialist countries and their media lackeys have sewed deep confusion about the true character of the war being waged on Syria. Nowhere is this confusion greater than in the United States, and it appears someone I deeply respect has been overtaken by it. 
In a recent issue of CounterPunch, Eric Draitser dives head deep into the confusion . He criticizes what he deems as two critical problems with the left's stance. Draitser first criticizes the pro-imperialist left for their decision to align themselves with the foreign-sponsored terror groups in Syria, which have been labeled ""revolutionaries"" or ""rebels"" by the imperialist countries. He then goes on to criticize leftists who have positioned themselves firmly in support of the Syrian government. 
It is his criticism of the ""pro-Assad left"" that needs further examination. Draitser reveals his deep confusion when he asks: 
""Will you continue to delude yourselves by refusing to accept the plainly obvious truth that no state or group has the best interests of Syrians at heart?"" 
Draitser's question assumes that the Syrian and Russian governments are equally to blame for the chaos in Syria. Their bombs are assumed to be prolonging the war and committing atrocities against the Syrian people at the same rate of the imperialists. If this is not the case, he doesn't state otherwise in the piece. In fact, Draitser sets out to prove true what has already been proven false by a wide range of independent and corporate media sources. 
‚ÄúThe imperialist countries and their media lackeys have sewed deep confusion about the true character of the war being waged on Syria.‚Äù 
First, Draitser claims that the war on Syria began as a genuine protest against ""neo-liberal"" reforms instituted by the Syrian government. This narrative is popular among the liberal-left media as well as the white left generally. However, those who make this claim rarely specify what neo-liberal reforms were made or how the confrontation all of a sudden became violent. Stephen Gowans reviews numerous reports from the corporate media that describe the uprising in March of 2011 as immediately violent, ill-supported, and ultimately insignificant in the midst of reforms from the Syrian government that were broadly supported by the Syrian people. At the same time as the violent uprisings, thousands of Syrians were protesting in the streets in support of President Assad. 
Furthermore, reports from the city of Daraa during the 2011 uprisings confirmed the presence of armed ""rebels"" who had freshly arrived from their US-NATO backed destruction of Libya . These ""rebels"" have since infested the country through various channels of the Syrian border. Each group possesses a fundamentalist Wahhabi ideology and receives varying degrees of assistance from the Gulf monarchies, Israel, Turkey, NATO, and of course, the US. This is confirmed in Draitser's article. Yet he still reinforces the claim that a popular uprising started the war even though Assad possessed broad support in 2011 . 
The truth is that the war on Syria has little to do with neo-liberalism or popular discontent. It has been acknowledged by UN sources that despite reforms, the Syrian economy remains highly regulated and socialist in character . Syria's own form of socialism has brought many benefits to the Syrian people. Healthcare and education are rights guaranteed to all citizens . Syria also possesses a secular government where Muslims, Christians, and all religious and ethnic groups lived peacefully prior to the war. Syria is thus a poor example of neo-liberalism. What economic struggles that do exist in Syria have largely stemmed from the harsh sanctions imposed by the US in 2004. 
‚ÄúThe war on Syria has little to do with neo-liberalism or popular discontent.‚Äù 
Furthermore, Draitser cites numerous sources that support regime change to smear the Syrian government and, by extension, the Syrian people. One of the sources receives much of its information from the White Helmets. The White Helmets have long been exposed as an NGO that works directly in service of imperialism's regime change operation in Syria. The organization receives approximately 33 million in funds directly from the US and UK governments. Eva Bartlett recently visited Aleppo and witnessed many White Helmet workers sporting arms and fighting among the terror groups . 
Draister also cites a source from the New York Post . The Post article relies heavily on documents collected by the dubious Center for International Justice and Accountability. This purported ""international law"" NGO is run by a consortium of corporate lawyers, former or current Amnesty International staffers, and various other servants of empire. The organization specializes in ""transitional justice."" In other words, the Center for International Justice and Accountability (CIJA) provides a legal framework for regime change on behalf of its imperial funders. Draitser claims no group involved in the war has the interests of the Syrian people at heart yet cites directly from an organization dedicated to the promotion of war in Syria. 
The NGOs and their partners in the corporate media have worked together to distort the reality on the ground. Aleppo is case and point. A ceasefire was brokered by all parties in late October that was supposed to allow Syrians to escape safely from East to West Aleppo. However, the humanitarian corridors were repeatedly shelled by the Nusra Front , the US-backed Al Qaeda affiliate . The media decided to ignore this and report instead that the ceasefire‚Äôs failure was due to the withholding of aid by Russia and Syria . This is but one example of many where the Syrian government has been blamed for the rebel-sponsored terror inflicted on Syrian people. 
‚ÄúHis analysis uses an abstract, moral argument to violate Syria's self-determination.‚Äù 
After five years of war on Syria, it is a wonder how anyone could believe a word that comes from the mouths of the imperialist countries. They lied about the origins of the conflict. They have continuously blamed the Syrian government for events that have all been traced back to the armed proxies they support. This includes the Houla Massacre , the sarin gas attack in Ghouta, and the so-called starvation of Madaya . Aleppo is no different. The Syrian city has been under constant siege from NATO-backed terrorists. The terrorists are holding nearly 250,000 Syrians hostage in the Eastern side of war-torn Aleppo. This has been verified by journalists on the ground such as Vanessa Beeley . 
These facts seem not to matter in Draitser's newfound assessment of Syria. His analysis uses an abstract, moral argument to violate Syria's self-determination. Calling those who unequivocally support the Syrian government ""fetishists"" assumes that the US left should take a position different from that of the Syrian people. Actual Syrians supported Bashar Al-Assad, and thus the Syrian Army, with 88.7 percent of the vote in the 2014 elections. To claim that the left in the US should fight for ""peace"" and at the same time oppose the Syrian government is an intentional attempt to remain neutral in a time of war. As Howard Zinn brilliantly stated, one cannot be neutral on a moving train. 
And the imperialist war against Syria is moving dangerously toward a World War III scenario. Hillary Clinton will be elected the next President of the United States and has repeatedly expressed that she will pursue a no-fly zone once in office. A no-fly zone would place Russian and Syrian military assets at risk of US-sponsored bombs and thus the world at risk of a global military confrontation not seen since World War II. How convenient it is then that Draitser should rebuke his former anti-imperialist stance in place of a stealth form of regime change. The world is on fire, yet Draitser has interpreted the situation as a chance to distort an already highly misunderstood situation . 
‚ÄúDraister's conclusions ultimately reinforce the Western assumption that the left must come to the rescue and save the Syrian people from their plight.‚Äù 
Positions such as Draitser‚Äôs are ultimately shaped by the material conditions of an imperialist empire in crisis and decline. White supremacy has been a principle condition of US imperialism since its inception. The war machine and white supremacy are deeply connected. The peoples and nations on imperialism's hit-list are routinely depicted in a manner that justifies the need for US and Western military medicine. This notion has trickled down to the day-to-day actions of ordinary people, including what currently passes as the ""anti-war"" movement in the US today. 
Draister's conclusions ultimately reinforce the Western assumption that the left must come to the rescue and save the Syrian people from their plight. Indeed, the Syrian people need allies and the left must be organizing toward an end to the war. But an end to the war cannot be achieved unless the left supports the will of the Syrian people. At the moment, this means the US left must align itself with the Syrian government and its allies. The left must act with uncompromising dedication to the principle of self-determination in every case where US and Western imperialism wages wars of neo-colonial plunder. Syria should be no exception. 
Of course, this critique should not be seen as a personal attack on Draitser himself. His body of work reflects a deep commitment to the struggle against war and Empire. He has often taken positions on international questions that are deeply unpopular with the US imperialist order. However, when mistakes are made, the left has a responsibility to correct them. There is too much at stake. Failure to step up in defense of Syria means another regime, change scenario similar to what happened in Yugoslavia, Iraq, and Libya. Draitser's piece is a study into the path that all genuine anti-imperialists should avoid. 
But what is the correct path forward? Imperialism is the unquestionable cause of the war in Syria, so imperialism must be the primary target of an anti-imperialist movement. The US and its allies are risking world war over Syria‚Äôs destruction. On the other side, the Syrian and Russian governments (along with Iran and China) are doing as much as they can to find a peaceful solution to the conflict that also respects Syria‚Äôs national sovereignty. It is without question that this is the side where the left ought to be in the continued struggle to end the war once and for all.

"‚ÄúWhen You Speak Up for the MOVE 9, You Speak Up for Yourself‚Äù","Tweet Widget by MOVE People 
The Philadelphia-based MOVE family was horribly victimized by police in 1978 and 1985. The first atrocity led to the mass imprisonment of MOVE members; the second assault killed five adults and six children and burned down a city block. No cops have ever been punished, but the MOVE 9 remain in prison, and were this year once again denied parole. ‚ÄúThey couldn't kill us that day, so they are trying to finish the job in these prisons.‚Äù ‚ÄúWhen You Speak Up for the MOVE 9, You Speak Up for Yourself‚Äù by MOVE People 
This article previously appeared on Move 9 blogspot . 
‚ÄúThe District Attorney never proved MOVE had killed a police officer.‚Äù 
The MOVE 9 Have been eligible for Parole since August 2008, After being in prison for 30 years. We have repeatedly been denied. In June of this year (2016) , we were denied parole again , for a total of ten years past the time we should have been released. One of the reasons the parole board gave to justify not releasing us is that we are a threat to the safety of the community. This is not true. People are not afraid of MOVE People. Move People ain't strangling people to death, shooting people in the back. It ain't MOVE that killed a man in front of his fianc√© and four year old child. MOVE is not drive by shooting, or terrorizing folks in the community. It's the community who is faxing, emailing, and calling the parole board asking for our release on parole. 
It is the Parole Board and D.A. John Straub who continue to deny our release for no valid reason. On August 8th 1978, hundreds of cops attacked our home at 3:00am in the morning trying to kill us. They couldn't kill us that day, so they are trying to finish the job in these prisons but understand: John Straub and the Parole Board are not justified. MOVE did not go out to the Police's house to do them harm. The Cops came to our house, because a judge sent them to our house to serve bench warrants for not appearing in court not for rape, murder, kidnapping or abuse but for not appearing in court for a civil matter. Understand this: hundreds of cops were sent to our home, while we were asleep, dressed in swat gear, armed with all type of weaponry, semi -automatic weapons, fire fighters, smoke bombs, tear gas, a deluge gun, a crane and a bulldozer to serve bench warrants, for a housing code violation. 
‚ÄúMove People ain't strangling people to death, shooting people in the back.‚Äù 
It was the Police who came to Move‚Äôs premises. They came armed to the teeth and in their frenzy to kill MOVE, they killed one of their own, and condemned us for it. We are not making this up. The evidence is clear. 
The whole world witnessed the attack on the MOVE house May 13th 1985, where the house was bombed into a blazing inferno, the six adults were shot and killed and the five children were shot back into the house by police as they tried to escape the burning flames where they died . These are proven Facts. During the city‚Äôs investigation hearing, it was ruled that the cops used excessive force and the killings were wrongful deaths. Those children were our children in that house that day, yet not one cop or official connected to the bombing of our family were held accountable, responsible for these deaths like the parole board is telling The MOVE 9 we have to take responsibility for a crime when the District Attorney never proved MOVE had killed a police officer. 
We have no weapons charges and the judge admitted on public radio to the caller, Mumia Abu Jamal [a radio journalist at the time], that he didn't have the faintest idea who shot the police officer. It's a fact that world renowned forensic experts Dr. Ali Hameli and Claus Speth ruled the deaths of the children HOMICIDES in a scathing report against the city, submitted to the assistant District Attorney Joan Weimer, but the grand jury did nothing. 
‚ÄúIt's time for everybody to start speaking freely in protest of all this free wheeling injustice.‚Äù 
The Move 9 have spent almost 40 years in prison for killing a cop, with no real proof. The whole world saw the Philadelphia police murder our children and family, and they have not spent a day in prison for it. But, what is the difference in these lives? Does a MOVE child not bleed, when they are shot? Does a MOVE parent not feel pain when their baby is killed, just because they are not cops or officials? Does the murder of a MOVE child, the pain of MOVE parent, the heartache of a black person's suffering still fall on deaf ears like the slaves who cried out when their babies, women and men were sold, killed, and whipped by slave owners? Ask yourself. Things may seem to have changed since those awful days, but the mentality is still very much existing. 
Just look around and listen. Black lives (Don't) Matter. That's why these cops are getting away with killing Black Men, Women, and Children. That's why The MOVE 9 are still in prison almost 40 years for killing a cop, and the cops responsible for killing 11 MOVE people, five of them children, are walking around like they are clean and without guilt. It's the mentality that makes them feel nothing after killing people. Because to them MOVE lives (Don't) matter. It's time for everybody to start speaking freely in protest of all this free wheeling injustice. People must understand this necessity of speaking out now. 
We are asking for people to sign The Petition we have aimed at United States Attorney General Loretta Lynch demanding that The United States Justice Dept open up an investigation into the ongoing and wrongful imprisonment of The MOVE 9. People can sign the petition at Https://causes.com/92454-free-the-move-9 . Speak out with the understanding that when speaking of MOVE, you are speaking up for yourself. It can't get better for MOVE without getting better for you.

This same Democratic Party that unquestionably rigged the primaries against the left-leaning Bernie Sanders campaign is now selling itself to the public as the savior of the downtrodden from the threat of an uber right wing candidate. 
Hillary Clinton at this point in her election run appears to be making no promises to the public other than to not to physically morph into Donald Trump during her coronation come Election Day. 
Lesseroftwoevilism is a bankrupt political ideology and the means by which the Democratic Party deadens any inkling towards decency or rational self interest that may lay dormant in the American electorate. Hillary Clinton and the Democratic Party intend to use the platform of ""at least not being Donald Trump"" to install the most despised Democratic candidate in a generation into the White House. 
It is indeed horrifying that a straight up eugenicist billionaire who brags about sexual assaulting women won the Republican primary. It is terrifying that the cult leader of a white nationalist zombie apocalypse has gotten this far through the electoral process. 
‚ÄúThere is no greater threat to the future of much of life on the planet than Hillary Clinton.‚Äù 
The country is polarizing and it is terrifying to see that much of it is polarizing in the direction of Donald Trump whose campaign is defined by phrases like ‚ÄúMake America Great Again‚Äù quickly followed by ‚ÄúMexico Will Pay.‚Äù Much of the country is also polarized in the direction of Bernie Sanders. It was the political apparatus of the Democratic Party, not the Republicans, that prevented these two competing visions from standing before the American public. 
Setting aside the fact, for a moment, that we don't live in a democracy, it must be noted that lesseroftwoevilism in American politics is an ideology by Americans for Americans. Hillary Clinton, Donald Trump, AND Bernie Sanders are all advocates of the US war machine. If any of these three warlords were to sit in the seat of power children in far off lands would still be bombed in their sleep and be reported on as collateral damage. 
Hillary Clinton is the most bloodthirsty advocate for murder and mayhem in a political system that thrives upon such practices. When it comes to dropping bombs, obliterating nations or possibly igniting a nuclear winter there is no greater threat to the future of much of life on the planet than Hillary Clinton. 
Rainbow Coalition of Hawks 
Far beyond a ‚Äúbasket of deplorables,‚Äù the 2016 Republican national convention was a ghastly horror show of the most reactionary, bigoted elements of American political culture. Less than esteemed actor Scott Baio captured the mood when he proclaimed, ‚Äúso of course let‚Äôs make America great again, but let‚Äôs make America America again.‚Äù That largely captured the theme of the proceedings and most speeches were some variation upon that theme. 
The Democrats in response sought to make their convention a big tent of peoples, ideas and movements. And indeed from the spontaneous chants of ‚Äúblack lives matter‚Äù to Tim Kaine leading a chant of ‚Äúsi se puede‚Äù to Eva Longoria reminding the audience ‚Äúwe didn‚Äôt cross the borders the borders crossed us‚Äù to Michelle Obama letting the thousands in attendance and the millions watching at home know that slave labor built the White House and the country, from Sebastian De La Cruz singing the national anthem in full mariachi garb to the Khan family holding a copy of the Constitution, the Democratic National Convention did present itself as a stark contrast to what the GOP was offering. 
The theme of inclusion ran high and, indeed, current president Barack Obama made his call for strength in unity, explicitly saying ‚ÄúAnd most of all I see Americans of every party, every background, every faith who believe we are stronger together, black white, Latino, Asian, Native American, young, old, gay, straight, men, women, folks with different abilities, all pledging allegiance, under the same proud flag, to this big bold country that we love.‚Äù One flag to rule them all. 
‚ÄúAmerica the greatest and most diverse nation on Earth shall ransack the globe as it sees fit. ‚Äù 
General John Allen, standing before a multi ethnic group of people continued upon this theme and made the connection between a more inclusive union and explicit projection of American might 
‚ÄúEvery American, in uniform or out, in the White House or at home, must be a force for unity in America, for a vision that includes all of us: every man and woman, every race, every ethnicity, every faith and creed, every gender orientation ‚Äì all of us together pursuing our common values. 
‚ÄúFrom the battlefield to the capitals of our allies, friends, and partners, the free peoples of the world look to America as the last best hope for peace and for liberty for all humanity, for we ARE the greatest country on this planet. 
‚ÄúSo we stand before you tonight to endorse Hillary Clinton for President of the United States of America.‚Äù 
The message could not be clearer. Sorry Donald Trump, we are all Americans here. No apologies rest of the world, America the greatest and most diverse nation on Earth shall ransack the globe as it sees fit. 
The response to the white nationalism of Donald Trump has been the rainbow coalition of hawks as chiefly embodied in the persons of Barrack Obama and Hillary Clinton. 
Hillary Clinton: The Obliterator of Nations 
Hillary Clinton is a war criminal. So is John Kerry. So is Condoleezza Rice. So are Colin Powell and Madeleine Albright. The secretary of state in an imperialist nation is the immediate manager of the projected might of the empire they represent. 
Hillary Clinton is known to be a war hawk for much the same reason Donald Trump is known as a white nationalist. She is blatant and crass about it. 
‚ÄúWe came. We saw. He died‚Äù ‚Äì Hillary Clinton on the assassination of Ghadaffi 
‚ÄúIn the next 10 years, during which they might foolishly consider launching an attack on Israel, we would be able to totally obliterate them‚Äù ‚Äì Hillary Clinton speaking of obliteration of 75 million Iranians. 
For much of the past few months the Clinton campaign have bemoaned a Russian conspiracy to reveal the words that Hillary Clinton actually wrote and thereby influence the American election. 
Hillary Clinton‚Äôs neo-Mcarthyite cold war against her own words and general war talk on Russia should come as no surprise to anyone paying any attention. She was hawkish on Russia in their land dispute with Georgia over Ossetia, even going so far as to arm the Georgian government in 2010 less than two years after the conflict. She was warlike on the conflict in the Ukraine, promising Ukrainian government officials as recent as September of this year to stand with them against ‚ÄúRussian aggression.‚Äù 
‚ÄúA Clinton presidency is the will of the ruling class.‚Äù 
This is the talk of someone prepared for a nuclear apocalypse. 
It should be mentioned, however, that Obama has also dialed up his anti Russian rhetoric, as has Tim Kaine, as has Mike Pence. It is only the white nationalist orange demon -- guided only by his own whims and twitter feuds -- that is at all off script on this question. 
Ultimately a Clinton presidency is the will of the ruling class. If she wants war it is a reflection of their desire for war. If they want the bombs to fall then death will rain from the sky. So long as they hold power they shall exercise it. So long as there is a ruling class they shall rule by fire and blood, because there truly is no alternative. Because ultimately, this is about Clinton and then again it isn‚Äôt. And this is about the Democrats and then again it isn‚Äôt. This is about the US and this is about war. Hillary Clinton is a 2016 warlord. War is a racket. And so is this God damn election. Matt Sedillo can be contacted at [email protected] .",1
Realities Faced by Black Canadians are a National Shame,"Tweet Widget by Robyn Maynard 
Canada, including its French-speaking regions, is home to much the same kind of systemic racism as its southern neighbor, according to a United Nations Working Group report. Black women‚Äôs poverty rates are ‚Äúalmost five times higher than that of white Canadian women.‚Äù In Montreal, ‚Äúa 2008 study found that black girls are three times more likely than white girls the same age to have been arrested two times or more.‚Äù Realities Faced by Black Canadians are a National Shame by Robyn Maynard 
This article previously appeared in the Montreal Gazette . 
‚Äú Black Montrealers continue to experience dehumanizing treatment across institutions.‚Äù 
After holding consultations in Quebec, Nova Scotia and Ontario last month, the United Nations Working Group on People of African Descent issued a statement that sheds light on realities, too-often invisible to most Canadians, that should be seen as a national shame. 
The group‚Äôs preliminary findings confirm what is already well known in Canada‚Äôs black communities: that systemic discrimination has subjected black people to racial profiling by law enforcement, soaring incarceration rates, disproportionate poverty and poor health, the over-apprehension of black children by child welfare agencies and lower graduation rates. Black women, they note, face a rate of poverty that is almost five times higher than that of white Canadian women, and are one of the fastest-growing groups in federal prisons. 
Underlying these injustices, the UN Working Group has made clear, is systemic racism. 
The UN is right to be concerned, and Montreal is by no means exempt from this criticism: Both its historical and contemporary realities are defined by a systemic anti-blackness that goes too frequently un-named. The enslavement of black (and indigenous) persons was not an uncommon practice in New France, and indeed was legal until 1834. The fact of slavery remains all around us: acclaimed art historian Charmaine Nelson reminds us that many present-day Montreal streets, buildings and institutions are named after white businessmen like James McGill and John Redpath who traded in plantation crops worked by slave labor. 
Enslavement may be over, but centuries later black Montrealers ‚Äî the largest visible minority in the city ‚Äî continue to experience dehumanizing treatment across institutions. A 2010 study by sociologists L√©onel Bernard and Christopher McAll found that it was over-surveillance, and not the rates of so-called ‚Äúblack crime,‚Äù that accounted for up to 60 per cent of the over-incarceration of black youth in Montreal. 
‚ÄúThe enslavement of black (and indigenous) persons was not an uncommon practice in New France, and indeed was legal until 1834.‚Äù 
A report commissioned by the Montreal police, leaked to La Presse, found that in St-Michel and Montr√©al-Nord, up to 40 per cent of black youth were stopped in 2006-2007, a rate that indicates a high degree of racial profiling by police officers. Much of this heightened policing was justified to the public as curbing ‚Äúgang activities,‚Äù when in reality, in 2009, only 1.6 per cent of crimes were gang related. High profile cases of police abuse of black Montrealers and alleged abuse continue to surface, including the recent case of Veckqueth Stevenson, a legally blind black man in his 50s, who has accused the police of using excessive force and unjustly arresting him, ironically, while he was at Nelson Mandela Park. 
Black women and girls are not exempt, though we hear even less about their experiences locally; the case of Majiza Philip, a black woman who says she had her arm broken by police in 2014, is one example, however. A 2008 study found that black girls in Montreal are three times more likely than white girls the same age to have been arrested two times or more. 
Beyond the criminal justice system, numerous studies have demonstrated that black children are apprehended from their homes by child welfare at alarming rates in Montreal, and this, too, can be attributed to racism. 
The UN Working group is not the first to point out these injustices, nor are they the only ones proposing solutions. Black Lives Matter-Toronto and other black activist groups in Toronto, Kingston, Ottawa, Vancouver and Montreal have been steadily mobilizing to address anti-black racism. Across cities, black communities have denounced, among other issues, the recent deaths of Abdirahman Abdi in Ottawa, and Bony Jean-Pierre in Montreal, both at the hands of police in 2016. 
If Canada intends to genuinely reckon with its still-living legacy of black enslavement, the injustices brought to light by the UN ‚Äî alongside those highlighted by black activists around the country ‚Äî need to be both addressed and redressed. Robyn Maynard is an activist and writer living in Montreal, author of the forthcoming book Policing Black Bodies (2017).",1
An Open Letter to Black South African Police Officers,"Tweet Widget by Black Power Front 
With students joining workers in revolt against South Africa‚Äôs neoliberal regime, young people are demanding to know why Black police are engaged in the same kind of repression that was previously used by white governments ‚Äúto systematically counter Black resistance?‚Äù In a letter to Black cops, activists note ‚Äúan increase and worrying pattern of anti-Black police violence.‚Äù An Open Letter to Black South African Police Officers by Black Power Front 
‚ÄúAs a Black Police Officer, you must understand that the struggles of Black workers and students are actually your struggles too.‚Äù 
Dear Black Police Officer, 
How are you today? Well, we hope. You may be wondering who we are, why we have decided to write to you and perhaps why we are addressing you as a ‚ÄúBlack Police Officer‚Äù -- as opposed to just saying ‚ÄúPolice Officer.‚Äù 
Who are we? We are the Black Power Front or BPF. We are a non-party political pro-Black platform which seeks to serve as an instrument to organize and collaborate with like-minded Black individuals and organizations, under a common program that provides practical responses to what is commonly understood as the Black Condition today. 
Why have we decided to write to you? First, given the nature of your work, it is not always easy to sit down with you and just talk about issues that affect our country and, in particular, the Black community. 
Second, like other members of the Black community, we in the BPF are deeply disturbed by the continued brutality of the police against Black workers and students -- particularly those who engage in legitimate protest action. And third, the BPF holds the view that, given where Black people find themselves economically, socially and otherwise today in relation to other racial groups, it is extremely urgent that like-minded Black groups and individuals (everywhere in the world) come together in exclusive spaces, and engage in constructive dialogue, with the view to find ways of getting Black people out of the quagmire they currently find themselves in. 
The anti-Black role of the police before 1994 
As members of the Black community, you would know that, in the Azanian (South Afrikan) context, from the 1400s onwards, various forms of colonial police structures were key instruments in enabling the European invaders to advance and bolster their evil agenda of slavery, colonization and land theft. It was these colonial police structures that were used to systematically counter Black resistance, through amongst others the capture, torture and in many cases beheading of our warrior ancestors such as uKumkani uHintsa, Kgosi Toto, Kgosi Galeshewe, uKumkani uStuurman and many other heroes and heroines of Black resistance. 
In the 20 th century, it was through these European colonial police structures that successive white supremacist regimes in Azania (South Afrika) were able to murder and torture our freedom fighters and ordinary Black people. They were directly responsible for the murder of our people in Sharpeville and Langa in 1960. The execution by hanging of martyrs like Vuyisile Mini and Solomon Mahlangu, in 1964 and 1979, respectively. 
It was the colonial European police who assassinated visionaries such as Onkgopotse Tiro and Steve Biko, in 1974 and 1977, respectively. It was them who murdered the young Zolile Petersen and Christopher Truter, during the student uprising of 1976. And it was them who ensured that many of our revered freedom fighters such as Kgalabi Masemola, Mangaliso Sobukwe, Lekoane Mothopeng, Pandelani Nefolovhodwe, Nkosi Molala, Muntu Myeza and many others, were banished to Robben Island. 
Even though it is often argued that the White Police Officers who were involved in these atrocities against Black people were acting under the orders of their superiors, the truth of the matter is that, at an individual and basic level, they knew that what they were doing to Black people was wrong, inhumane and unjustified. 
The anti-Black role of the police after 1994 
Given this painful history of centuries of systematic and state violence against Black people, the declaration of ‚Äúfreedom‚Äù on April 27, 1994, created a legitimate expectation on the part of many Black people that the type of wanton violence and naked brutality that the successive colonial white supremacist regimes unleashed on Black people would be a thing of the past. But to our horror, even after the declaration of ‚Äúfreedom‚Äù in 1994 and the installation of a government that is led by Black people we began to see an increase and worrying pattern of anti-Black police violence. 
This type of anti-Black police [U1] brutality was palpable in the killing of Andries Tatane, young Nqobile Nzuza, Mike Tshele, Lerato Seema, Osiah Rahube, Jan Rivombo and of course the brutal and targeted assassinations of Mgcineni ‚ÄúMambush‚Äù Noki and other Black workers in Marikana, in August 2012. 
All of these anti-Black atrocities beg the question: how it is possible that a government that is led by people who, as part of the Black community, have first-hand experience of the brutality of state violence through the police, do not just unleash the same type of state violence against their own people, but also seek to justify the use of such anti-Black violence? 
Our attitude towards Black police officers 
By highlighting the involvement of Black Policer Officers (after 1994) in the killing of ordinary Black people who are simply fighting for their right to be human the BPF does not seek to create the mind-set that Black Police Officers are the enemy of the Black community or that Black Police Officers are inherently bad people. Of course, there are many examples of Black Police Officers who don‚Äôt just do their job with integrity and dedication, but also do a lot of good work in the Black community. 
This notwithstanding, the main focus of this letter, however, is not so much the individual conduct of Black Police Officers but rather the continued use of Black Police Officers (as a state function) in the brutal suppression of the right of ordinary and mainly poor Black people to freely articulate their social, economic and political concerns and aspirations. 
Our appeal to Black police officers 
As the BPF, we regard Black Police Officers as members of the Black community first and therefore an integral part of Black life in Azania. We also hold the view that the on-going demands by Black workers for decent wages and better working conditions or those of Black students for free-decolonized-Afrocentric education, are not just demands that will benefit individual Black Police Officers (majority of them Black young people), but also their children who might be at university or will be going there in future. Therefore, as a Black Police Officer, you must understand that the struggles of Black workers and students are actually your struggles too. 
As the BPF we fully understand that, just like all ordinary Black people, Black Police Officers are under severe financial stress and like most Black people, they are struggling to make ends meet. For these reasons, the BPF‚Äôs clarion call to all Black Police Officers is as follows: 
* Understand that the economic struggles and frustrations of ordinary Black people are your struggles and frustrations too. And that Black workers and students continue to be oppressed by the same system that is responsible for your personal financial stress; 
* As part of the Black community, you must (through your labor unions), engage the management of the SAPS to stop the state‚Äôs campaign of apartheid-style violence that is currently being unleashed on Black people in general; 
* You are our Black Brothers and Sisters and must never allow yourselves to be used by self-serving politicians as part of an elitist anti-Black-pro-capitalist plot that uses the pretext of ‚Äúlaw and order‚Äù to justify the murder of poor Black people and wanting that Black people timidly accept their status as economic slaves in the land of their ancestors; and 
* Lastly, Black students and workers are not fighting against you (as Black police officers) but against the anti-Black-pro-capitalist system that is using some of you against your own Black Sisters and Brothers.

Hillary‚Äôs ‚ÄúBig Tent‚Äù is Obama‚Äôs ‚ÄúGrand Bargain‚Äù on Steroids,"2016 presidential campaign by BAR executive editor Glen Ford 
Barack Obama tried to woo Republicans into a ‚ÄúGrand Bargain‚Äù that would have gutted Social Security. Bill Clinton let loose the banks. But Donald Trump‚Äôs destruction of the Republican Party will allow Hillary Clinton to ‚Äúgather the whole of the ruling class under the same party banner, in one Big Tent, where the grandest of bargains can be conceived and achieved without crossing an aisle.‚Äù The rich are about to get their best deal yet. Hillary‚Äôs ‚ÄúBig Tent‚Äù is Obama‚Äôs ‚ÄúGrand Bargain‚Äù on Steroids by BAR executive editor Glen Ford 
‚Äú The exodus from the GOP has suddenly transformed the Democratic Party into the primary political instrument of the ruling class.‚Äù 
When Donald Trump took a wrecking ball to the Republican Party he provided the unexpected catalyst for completion of the corporate project begun by Bill Clinton, Al Gore and other white Democrats in the 1980s, with the founding of the Democratic Leadership Council (DLC). To counter relentless attrition of whites to the GOP in their home states, these beleaguered, mostly southern Democrats sought national corporate funding to turn their party decisively to the right. They reckoned, correctly, that a steady stream of corporate capital would allow them to control the new wave of Black voters and politicians that had been mobilized by Rev. Jesse Jackson‚Äôs two presidential campaigns, while strengthening the hand of the South in national Democratic Party calculations. 
Bill Clinton became the first DLC president in 1992, and moved swiftly and methodically to narrow the ideological differences between the duopoly parties. He completed much of Ronald Reagan‚Äôs agenda, claiming it as his own; destroyed welfare ‚Äúas we knew it‚Äù; vastly expanded the mass Black Incarceration regime; pushed NAFTA through Congress over the objections of majorities in his own party; engineered the corporate monopolization of broadcast media; and removed the last safety straps from Wall Street banks. 
‚ÄúClinton arranged the deployment of thousands of foreign jihadists to Bosnia and Kosovo.‚Äù 
In foreign affairs, Clinton initiated what was to become the doctrine of ‚Äúhumanitarian‚Äù military intervention, dismantling and partially occupying the socialist nation of Yugoslavia. In the process, Clinton arranged the deployment of thousands of foreign jihadists to Bosnia and Kosovo, thus keeping operational the network created by the U.S., Saudi Arabia and Pakistan during the previous decade in Afghanistan. In Africa, Clinton conspired with Uganda and exiled Tutsi rebels to overthrow the Hutu majority government in Rwanda, setting off a bloodbath in 1994, followed two years later by an invasion of Congo that has killed more than six million people -- and still counting. 
Barack Obama was the second DLC president (although he lies about his membership). He, too, moved with unseemly haste to reach a ‚ÄúGrand Bargain‚Äù with the GOP -- not of necessity, since he had won a huge electoral mandate with the overwhelming financial backing of Wall Street, but as a matter of ideological principle. In January of 2009, before even taking the oath of office, Obama told the editorial boards of the New York Times and the Washington Post that all ‚Äúentitlements,‚Äù including Medicare and Social Security, would be ‚Äú on the table ‚Äù for cutting in his administration. Obama‚Äôs first project, now considered the centerpiece of his legacy, was to resurrect the rightwing Heritage Foundation‚Äôs corporate health insurance scheme, adopted by Republican presidential candidate Bob Dole in 1996, and made into state law by Republican Massachusetts governor Mitt Romney, in 2006. Obama‚Äôs Affordable Care Act was, literally, written by lobbyists for the insurance and drug industries, and is now collapsing like a poorly constructed house at the end of its mortgage. 
‚ÄúFor the better part of two years Obama debased himself, all but begging the Republicans to consummate his ‚ÄòGrand Bargain.‚Äô‚Äù 
With the Democratic majority in Congress in no mood to tamper with Social Security and Medicare, Obama tried to maneuver the targeted entitlements into a financial crisis trap. He named two dependable reactionaries, Alan Simpson and Erskine Bowles, as co-chairmen of his National Commission on Fiscal Responsibility, also called the Commission on Deficit Reduction. They dutifully recommended $4 trillion in budget cuts, mostly to social programs, including cuts to Social Security. Although the full commission did not endorse the chairs‚Äô recommendations, and the Congress failed to pass bills modeled on the document, Obama used the Simpson-Bowles formula as a basis for negotiating what he hoped would be a ‚Äúbipartisan‚Äù (GOP plus Obama and a minority of Democrats) massacre of entitlements. For the better part of two years Obama debased himself, all but begging the Republicans to consummate his ‚ÄúGrand Bargain.‚Äù Congressional Black Caucus chairman Emanuel Cleaver, of Kansas City, called the deal a ‚Äú Satan‚Äôs Sandwich ,‚Äù but Obama continued to pursue a political marriage made in hell until the 2012 reelection campaign clock called a halt to the spectacle. 
‚ÄúA de facto super-party of the bourgeoisie.‚Äù 
The quest for a Grand Bargain was Barack Obama‚Äôs failed attempt to best Bill Clinton in erasing the distinctions between the two major parties ‚Äì to create a de facto super-party of the bourgeoisie. It was the Republicans who ran away from the altar. And the Democrats did eat much of the Satan‚Äôs Sandwich, through sequestration and austerity that ravaged social programs by other means. 
Why did the Republicans reject the deal? Although both halves of the duopoly ultimately answer to Wall Street, the Republicans, like any other party, have an institutional interest in winning office. It is true that Obama had crafted a deal that any Republican would love, but it was still his deal, and he planned to run for reelection as an historical dealmaker. Probably just as importantly, the Republican Party is the White Man‚Äôs party, meaning, white supremacy is its organizing principle, central to its identity among much of the masses. To embrace Obama, no matter how advantageous to their big business patrons, was a hug too far for the GOP. Racism doomed the Grand Bargain ‚Äì Hallelujah! 
A New, Bigger Bargain 
Recently released Wikileaks emails reveal Hillary Clinton speaking to bankers at Morgan Stanley in 2013, a year after the debacle. ‚ÄúThe Simpson-Bowles framework and the big elements of it were right,‚Äù she said. 
Thanks to Donald Trump‚Äôs demolition of the Republican Party, the conditions have been created for Hillary Clinton, as DLC President #3, to achieve what #1 and #2 could not: gather the whole of the ruling class under the same party banner, in one Big Tent, where the grandest of bargains can be conceived and achieved without crossing an aisle. With most of the ruling class and its attendants having vacated the building, the Republican Party has been reduced to Donald Trump and his ‚Äúdeplorables,‚Äù as Hillary calls them. Trump‚Äôs opposition to corporate trade deals violated the Holy Grail against prohibiting capitalists from moving money and jobs around the world as they see fit, and his reluctance to support regime change as an inherent right of American exceptionalism has frightened and outraged the military industrial complex, the national security establishment, and all sectors dependent on the maintenance of empire. 
‚ÄúAn inherently unstable arrangement.‚Äù 
Clinton‚Äôs Big Tent is not a temporary, election season dwelling. It is how she plans to govern. The exodus from the GOP has suddenly transformed the Democratic Party into the primary political instrument of the ruling class, while at the same time the party nominally represents most of the folks who are abused and misused by that ruling class. It is an inherently unstable arrangement, and will soon be wracked by splits, as a post-Trump GOP attempts to lure its fat cats back and the darker and poorer constituencies consigned to the latrine area of Hillary‚Äôs high class tent break to the Left for air. 
But in the interim, Clinton will have a unique opportunity to cut grand austerity deals with all the ‚Äúbig elements‚Äù of Simpson-Bowles, to renege on her corporate trade promises, and to wage war with great gusto in the name of a ‚Äúunited‚Äù country. Ever since the Democratic National Convention it has been clear that the Clintonites are encouraged to consider everyone outside of their grand circle to be suspect, subversive, or depraved. Their inclusive rhetoric is really an invocation of a ruling class consensus, now that Trump has supposedly brought the ruling class together under one banner. In Hillary‚Äôs tent, the boardrooms are always in session. BAR executive editor Glen Ford can be contacted at [email protected] .",1

To embrace Obama, no matter how advantageous to their big business patrons, was a hug too far for the GOP. Racism doomed the Grand Bargain ‚Äì Hallelujah! 
A New, Bigger Bargain 
Recently released Wikileaks emails reveal Hillary Clinton speaking to bankers at Morgan Stanley in 2013, a year after the debacle. ‚ÄúThe Simpson-Bowles framework and the big elements of it were right,‚Äù she said. 
Thanks to Donald Trump‚Äôs demolition of the Republican Party, the conditions have been created for Hillary Clinton, as DLC President #3, to achieve what #1 and #2 could not: gather the whole of the ruling class under the same party banner, in one Big Tent, where the grandest of bargains can be conceived and achieved without crossing an aisle. With most of the ruling class and its attendants having vacated the building, the Republican Party has been reduced to Donald Trump and his ‚Äúdeplorables,‚Äù as Hillary calls them. Trump‚Äôs opposition to corporate trade deals violated the Holy Grail against prohibiting capitalists from moving money and jobs around the world as they see fit, and his reluctance to support regime change as an inherent right of American exceptionalism has frightened and outraged the military industrial complex, the national security establishment, and all sectors dependent on the maintenance of empire. 
‚ÄúAn inherently unstable arrangement.‚Äù 
Clinton‚Äôs Big Tent is not a temporary, election season dwelling. It is how she plans to govern. The exodus from the GOP has suddenly transformed the Democratic Party into the primary political instrument of the ruling class, while at the same time the party nominally represents most of the folks who are abused and misused by that ruling class. It is an inherently unstable arrangement, and will soon be wracked by splits, as a post-Trump GOP attempts to lure its fat cats back and the darker and poorer constituencies consigned to the latrine area of Hillary‚Äôs high class tent break to the Left for air. 
But in the interim, Clinton will have a unique opportunity to cut grand austerity deals with all the ‚Äúbig elements‚Äù of Simpson-Bowles, to renege on her corporate trade promises, and to wage war with great gusto in the name of a ‚Äúunited‚Äù country. Ever since the Democratic National Convention it has been clear that the Clintonites are encouraged to consider everyone outside of their grand circle to be suspect, subversive, or depraved. Their inclusive rhetoric is really an invocation of a ruling class consensus, now that Trump has supposedly brought the ruling class together under one banner. In Hillary‚Äôs tent, the boardrooms are always in session. BAR executive editor Glen Ford can be contacted at [email protected] .",1

The Anatomy of Crisis and the Decline of US Empire,"The Anatomy of Crisis and the Decline of US Empire Submitted by Danny Haiphong on Tue, 11/08/2016 - 12:18 Tweet Widget by Danny Haiphong 
There are multiple dimensions to the crisis that afflicts U.S. imperialism. The latest election is evidence of a crisis of legitimacy for the ruling parties. Americans are estranged from a government that spies on every one its citizens ‚Äì and on the rest of the world, too. ‚ÄúUnemployment, poverty, racist state repression, and war are all the system has to offer.‚Äù Unable to escape a 40-year economic slump, the U.S. instead plots the destruction of its rivals. The Anatomy of Crisis and the Decline of US Empire by Danny Haiphong 
‚Äú The vast majority of oppressed communities, particularly Black workers, have seen their labor become disposable in a post-industrial society.‚Äù 
Whether one analyzes the economic, military, or political spheres of US imperialism, one thing is abundantly clear. The very fabric of the United States is in deep crisis. The crisis is largely misunderstood by the vast majority of working and oppressed people living under it. But a specter haunts the US and it isn't anything like Hollywood's scary movies. That specter is the possibility that the people will become a conscious force of opposition to the crisis and seek to dismantle the system of capitalist empire that governs it. 
Crises are genuinely thought of in economic terms. The economic base of capitalism is indeed suffering from protracted economic crisis. The US capitalist economy, and thus the world capitalist economy pegged to its hip, entered a period of stagnation in the mid to late 1970s. What followed was a slowdown in production facilitated by the increased monopolization, financialization, and increased technological capacity of the system. Capitalism's source of profit, labor, was now being exploited by an apparatus too big to expand the profits of the system without intensified exploitation. The aftermath of capitalism's periodic collapses from overproduction and under consumption have been characterized ever since by a complete and total assault on all workers. 
‚ÄúWages have declined or remained stagnant for nearly four decades.‚Äù 
The conditions of the crisis speak for themselves. Workers in the US, and the entire Western world for that matter, have seen conditions rapidly deteriorate as the capitalist system has sought to maximize profits in the face of productive slowdown. Free trade agreements such as NAFTA have given corporations the freedom to eliminate production domestically in order to seek a better deal internationally. Wages have declined or remained stagnant for nearly four decades . Unemployment has become a permanent fixture of life for millions and nearly one of two people in the US are considered poor or ""near poor."" 
At this time, the US is a low-wage capitalist economy dominated by service oriented, precarious employment. Racism has played a large part in the disparity inherent under these conditions. The wealth gap between Black America and White America is larger than it was in the Civil rights era. Not only has Black America been the target of racist housing policies from predatory lenders leading up to the 2008 crisis, but the burden of privatization and austerity has been directly aimed at Black families. Hedge funds, for example, have used working class Black communities as the guinea pig to test the effectiveness of massive school closures and teacher layoffs as well as the expansion of charter schools. Thousands of Black teachers have lost their jobs as a result to the mostly white demographic of Teach for America corps members. 
‚Äú The wealth gap between Black America and White America is larger than it was in the Civil rights era.‚Äù 
However, it is not enough to understand the crisis of capitalism through an economic lens. The crisis possesses many forms. Repressive state activity has become more pronounced, especially in the aftermath of the War on Terror. Racist repression in particular has intensified as the vast majority of oppressed communities, particularly Black workers, have seen their labor become disposable in a post-industrial society. Nearly 1100 Black Americans are killed every year by law enforcement all over the country. The war on Black and indigenous peoples that laid the foundation of the United States has only become more severe, as evidenced by the fact that one of every eight prisoners in the world is a Black American. The Dakota Access Pipeline struggle has shown that not even the concentration camps forced upon indigenous people are safe from the profit-seeking tentacles of the crisis-ridden system. 
And every American can guarantee that civil liberties are a thing of the past. The NSA, FBI, and the rest of the intelligence community possess access to the entire population's mail and phone devices. A massive surveillance dragnet accountable to no one but the ruling class allows the US state to keep tabs on whoever resists the conditions of the crisis. War at home is ultimately a reflection of the broader war being waged around the world. The US capitalist system is a global system with the largest military state in human history. War has thus played a critical role in the response to system crisis. 
The US military acts as the enforcement arm of neo-colonialism and capitalist exploitation around the world. It has expanded into nearly every African state through the US African Command (AFRICOM). The US military state continues to support fascism in Ukraine and fundamentalist Islam in places like Saudi Arabia and Qatar. It has destabilized a number of nations in the last decade alone, including Iraq, Afghanistan, and Libya. The US has collaborated with NATO, Israel, and Turkey to militarily encircle Russia and China militarily and sponsor terror groups responsible for the massacres in Syria. 
‚ÄúThe US imperialist system is predicated on the expansion of global capital by any means at its disposal, including the use military force to clear the way for corporate plunder. 
But the US military is in crisis too. It is plagued by a disillusioned rank and file and the inevitability of a global confrontation with Russia and China if it continues on the current course. The demands of a stagnating global capitalist economy and the ever-increasing exploitation of masses of working people offer no potential for a reversal of fortune. The US imperialist system is predicated on the expansion of global capital by any means at its disposal, including the use military force to clear the way for corporate plunder. The US military state has grown both in size and in violence in order to prevent the global shift of power currently underway. 
Russia and China have become the number one challengers to US global hegemony. China's economy will soon surpass that of the US and Russia's recovery from post-Soviet collapse has propelled the Putin-led nation back onto the global scene as a major factor in world affairs. These two powers are becoming increasingly close both economically and militarily. This has made the US ruling class increasingly nervous in the midst of economic decline. To maintain hegemony, the US military state set the world ablaze through endless war in every region of the world that dares to seek ties with Russia and China. 
At this point, the US imperialist system cannot peacefully compete in any way with its so-called rivals to the East. The contradictions of the system have become unmanageable. Unemployment, poverty, racist state repression, and war are all the system has to offer. Another economic collapse is on the horizon. Crisis is built into the global capitalist system's constant drive to accumulate profit in the face of global misery. The decline of US imperialism and empire will not change regardless of the election. What is sure to change is the mass reaction to the decline as life becomes more and more unbearable under the grip of empire.

Margaret Flowers‚Äô Retrospective on Running as a Green for the U.S. Senate,"2016 elections by BAR editor and columnist Dr. Marsha Adebayo 
The major parties are more concerned with preserving their duopoly than with defeating each other. So-called ‚Äúprogressives‚Äù help preserve duopoly rule, failing ‚Äúto understand that as long as they are complicit with the Democrats, they have no power.‚Äù Most people are actually more Green than Democratic in their views, but ‚Äúhave a hard time comprehending that there are more than two parties,‚Äù according to Green candidate Dr. Flowers. Margaret Flowers‚Äô Retrospective on Running as a Green for the U.S. Senate by BAR editor and columnist Dr. Marsha Adebayo 
‚Äú The message of the Green Party resonates with people because we talk about real issues that they experience in their lives and solutions that they want to see.‚Äù 
The Democratic and Republican parties‚Äô attempt to monopolize the presidential media cycle was challenged by candidates like Dr. Margaret Flowers, who ran for the US Senate on the Green Party ticket in Maryland. She used the electoral platform to speak directly to working class communities. Dr Flowers was profiled in a recent BAR article regarding the decision of the Maryland League of Women Voters to deny her the right to participate in the only televised senatorial debate. Undaunted, Dr. Flowers took to the stage and demanded to be recognized as an equal participate in the electoral process. She was escorted off stage by security forces under protest with audience members shouting: ‚ÄúLet her speak!‚Äù 
Margaret is a Maryland pediatrician and mother of three. In 2007, she made the decision to stop practicing clinical medicine, which she viewed as antithetical to the welfare of working class and front line communities. Instead, she decided to ‚Äúpractice political medicine.‚Äù The class dynamics of health care is evident to her. ‚ÄúThe wealth divide is one of our biggest health care problems‚Äù and is the cause of ‚Äúthe greatest disparity‚Äù in health outcomes. In 2009, she joined Physicians for a National Health Program, becoming a Congressional Fellow and opening a chapter in Maryland. She was arrested at a Senate Roundtable on Health Insurance for speaking on behalf of the single payer option. Margaret said in an interview: ‚Äúour first goal was to have a seat at the table‚Ä¶.If we couldn‚Äôt get a seat, at least we could expose the insincerity of the current attempt at healthcare reform and show that single payer was actively being excluded.‚Äù 
Margaret views the struggle for health care as ‚Äúpart of a broader social, racial, economic and environmental justice movement.‚Äù She has organized campaigns to fight for state and federal single payer health care systems. In addition, Margaret provided leadership and took on corporations focusing on the issue of net neutrality, the concept that everyone should have equal access to the Internet regardless of their usage or ability to pay. 
I met Margaret during the Freedom Plaza Occupy Movement in Washington, DC where she helped me organize the Occupy EPA demonstrations. 
Below, Margaret provides her reflections and analysis on running as the 2016 Green Party candidate for the US Senate in Maryland. 
Adebayo: What political and cultural lessons did you learn from running against the Democratic and Republican machines? 
Flowers: Running for office in Maryland taught me that the major political party machines, especially the Democratic Party, are pervasive in our state. Their tentacles reach deep into the non-profit organizations, the media, the polling organizations and the universities. 
There is a culture in the state that is trapped in the duopoly. People are so used to thinking in terms of just Democrats and Republicans that they have a hard time comprehending that there are more than two parties. It is almost like a habit. When confronted with the reality that the media, non-profits, polls and universities were excluding our campaign, the most common responses were that this is how it has always been or that they excluded us because they could. 
It was disappointing that the Maryland League of Women Voters, which is supposed to be nonpartisan and educate voters about their choices on the ballot, imposed an arbitrary high polling criterion that was used to keep me out of debates. It was disappointing that a public university, the University of Baltimore, which sponsored the only televised senate debate in Maryland, shut down political discourse by excluding me even though I would have provided a perspective that was not heard in the debate. 
It was interesting to see how the media and polling organizations create a Catch-22 situation for alternative party candidates. Early on in my campaign, when public pressure was applied, the Baltimore Sun published one article on my campaign that mostly argued that I had no chance of winning and that I was mostly like a Democrat. Their failure to cover my campaign early on, or to even mention that I was running when they covered the other candidates, made it less likely that I would reach potential donors and volunteers. This made it less likely that I would poll well, especially since there were few polls that included me and they were done in September. As a result, my low polling numbers were used to justify my exclusion from events. 
When our campaign did reach people, we received a very welcoming response. People are interested in a broader discussion of the crises we are facing and solutions to them. The solutions that I support are widely supported by the public. 
And finally, it was interesting to see how so-called progressive organizations are trapped inside the Democratic Party and fail to understand that as long as they are complicit with the Democrats, they have no power. They fail to understand that their undying support for Democrats basically means that they are taken for granted. Unfortunately, ‚Äúprogressive‚Äù organizations endorsed Van Hollen and Clinton, even though their platforms include support for fracking and war and only partial solutions to the crises in education, healthcare and other human rights violations. This support and undying commitment of so-called ‚Äúprogressive‚Äù organizations to the Democratic Party defies logic. 
Adebayo: In your opinion, how can the Green Party use the momentum of your state campaign as well as the national Stein/Baraka campaign to create a more effective popular grass-roots movement? 
Flowers: It is already happening. New Green Party locals are forming around the state of Maryland. The current locals are growing. Many of the people who are involved in the locals are also involved in advocacy and activism, so there is a natural synergy. It is our task now to continue to nurture and grow that for the next election and to encourage greater collaboration and visibility of the Green Party with local movements. 
Personally, my next focus will be to stop the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP). We are organizing to stop it from being ratified by Congress after the election. If we stop that, it will be a huge victory of popular power over corporate power. We can build off that to encourage more people to rise up and demand that the political agenda protect people and the planet. 
Adebayo: How do third party organizations, such as the Green Party, fight the political, financial and media dominance of the two major corporate parties? 
Flowers: This is a David and Goliath fight, but we have truth and justice on our side. The message of the Green Party resonates with people because we talk about real issues that they experience in their lives and solutions that they want to see. We are working to expose the media blackout and to encourage people to demand that the media and debates are more inclusive. And we are learning to use social media platforms to reach people. One aspect of the campaign that is very heartening is the commitment of the volunteers. People are donating their skills in filmmaking and graphic design. People are doing regular outreach and visibility actions across the state. It is truly amazing and it energizes me to see it. 
Adebayo: As you reflect on your Senate campaign, what strategies worked best to encourage activism and what stratagems could you have employed to elicit more public support? 
Flowers: Running a statewide campaign is a challenge. Some of the best experiences that I had were doing one-on-one outreach around the state. I would definitely do more of that if I ran again. And holding volunteer training sessions is critical for people to develop comfort with outreach strategies. I am sure that there is more that I could do, but at this point I am still focused on completing this campaign. Then we will debrief more.

Black American Anti-Imperialism: an Invisible Subject for the New York Times,"Tweet Widget by Bryan K. Bullock 
To read the foreign policy pages of the New York Times is to enter a world of whiteness. ‚ÄúWhites are the only ones who are presumed to have an opinion on such issues that is worth mentioning.‚Äù Although Black America is the nation‚Äôs most anti-imperial constituency, foreign policy is considered a white preserve. Blacks ‚Äúserve the function we have always served: subjects of imperialism, scapegoats for repression, but not shapers of foreign policy.‚Äù Black American Anti-Imperialism: an Invisible Subject for the New York Times by Bryan K. Bullock 
‚ÄúFrom Vietnam through Iraq, African Americans have proved to be the group of Americans most opposed to U.S. military intervention.‚Äù 
The October 4, 2016, issue of the New York Times , which contained the article, ‚ÄúSyrian War Magnifies Tension in America‚Äôs Global Mission,‚Äù is a case study in white supremacy. The article is framed from a totally white ‚Äúconservative‚Äù and ‚Äúliberal‚Äù frame, and completely ignores the perspective of African Americans, who, traditionally, and today, are consistently and overwhelmingly, anti-imperialism and who tend to identify with other Black and Brown people across the globe, including the Palestinians and Syrians. 
The article purports to give ‚Äúboth sides‚Äù of the argument for U.S. intervention in the affairs of sovereign nations. The authors of the article give the impression that they are being ‚Äúbalanced‚Äù in giving the views of those who support America‚Äôs ‚Äúmission‚Äù in the world and those who are ‚Äúcritical‚Äù of said ‚Äúmission.‚Äù This false ‚Äúbalance‚Äù does not include the perspectives of any African American historians or critics of U.S. foreign policy, like Professor Gerald Horne, Bill Fletcher, Anthony Monteiro, Glen Ford or African (American) scholars like Horace Campbell. In fact, ‚Äúboth sides‚Äù of any debate in the U.S. regarding foreign policy, are both white ‚Äúsides.‚Äù This is particularly true when it comes to U.S. foreign policy, where whites are the only ones who are presumed to either have an opinion on such issues, or one that is worth mentioning. 
It is true that ‚Äúboth sides‚Äù could include Blacks who adhere to the Eurocentric, party-line views of the dominant U.S. narrators, say, Donna Brazile or Condoleezza Rice, or Blacks on the so-called ‚Äúleft,‚Äù but their views (still missing from this piece) are not a Black critique. It is a Eurocentric critique coming from a Black person, which is fundamentally different than an African American critique viewed through the lens of the African American experience. The ideas, views and critiques of Black thinkers are notoriously absent in the pages of the Times when it comes to foreign policy -- which proves that the writers, the editorial staff and the paper itself does not consider those views important. And in ignoring those critiques, it also ignores the historical critical analysis of the people who are and have been the subjects of U.S. foreign policy. 
‚ÄúThe ideas, views and critiques of Black thinkers are notoriously absent in the pages of the Times when it comes to foreign policy.‚Äù 
It also completely ignores the analysis of great Black historical thinkers like W.E.B. DuBois, Walter Rodney and Paul Robeson, Malcolm X, the late stage Martin Luther King, Jr., as well as the organizations they represented such as the Council on African Affairs (the CAA), the NAACP of the 1940‚Äôs, the African Liberation Support Committee, the Black Panther Party, The African Blood Brotherhood, the Organization of Afro-American Unity, Trans Africa, the U.S. Human Rights Network, the United Negro Improvement Association or the National Council of Black Lawyers, all of whom were deeply critical of America‚Äôs so-called mission in the world, especially as it related to African and Asian peoples, like Haitians, Congolese, Syrians, Yemenis and Palestinians. The critiques of these people are irrelevant to, not only the Times , but in truth, to the Democratic and Republican parties, the current incarnation of the NAACP, the Black Congressional Caucus, President Obama and most white liberal formations. However, this is not a reason to give the Times a pass. Even the use of the word ‚Äúmission,‚Äù with the European habit of sending missionaries into Africa and the Americas to soften the people up with European religion before they were subdued by hard power, does not elicit irony on the part of the Times . The ‚Äúwhite man‚Äôs burden‚Äù of ‚Äúcivilizing‚Äù the darker races of the world, through enslavement, destroying their religions, cultures, languages, colonizing their lands and resource and extracting their people and whisking them away to foreign lands to toil from birth to death for free, is just as important and essential a part of the history of ‚ÄúAmerica‚Äôs Global Mission‚Äù as anything else mentioned in the piece. 
The hand wringing of the mostly white imperialists on the ‚Äúleft‚Äù and on the right, regarding the proper way to engage in imperialism, is essentially what the piece presents. No other perspectives or voices are important or valid. Thus the perspectives of African American thinkers are only relevant in American discourse when it concerns ‚Äúblack‚Äù issues like police brutality, but not on international issues, although many black writers and thinkers would argue the two are connected. This is so even though the very presence people of African descent in America is a direct result of the United States‚Äô foreign policy of capturing, importing and enslaving African people. This point is lost on white foreign policy writers. However, early Black thinkers were clear on this point. People like DuBois and Robeson, in the past, and contemporaries like Glen Ford, were/are, fiercely anti-imperialist. 
‚ÄúThe perspectives of African American thinkers are only relevant in American discourse when it concerns ‚Äòblack‚Äô issues like police brutality, but not on international issues.‚Äù 
The white, imperialist presentation in the article excludes the ideas of Syrian Americans, Indigenous populations, Mexican and Puerto Rican Americans and Hawaiians, all of whom may have a totally different idea of America‚Äôs ‚Äúobligation‚Äù in Syria. Penny M. Von Eschen notes in the book, Race Against Empire, Black Americans and Anticolonialism 1937-1957 , that ‚ÄúObjecting to U.S. support for South African and the European colonial powers, and increasingly challenging the notion that America was the legitimate leader of the ‚Äòfree world‚Äô and therefore above censure, black Americans both criticized new directions in American foreign policy and attempted to use the United Nations as a forum in which to gain support for civil rights struggles in the United States.‚Äù African Americans are no less critical of America‚Äôs self-serving ‚Äúmission‚Äù today as was then. African Americans were highly critical of the U.S.‚Äôs violent overthrow of the African nation of Libya, its aggressions toward Cuba in the 60‚Äôs and Venezuela in the Chavez era and today. We have not forgotten America‚Äôs refusal to recognize Haiti as an independent Black nation when it defeated the French. Nor are we unmindful of the U.S. invasion of Haiti in 1915 and its support of dictators of the Duvalier family, the coup of the Aristide government and the fact that President Obama tried to prevent Aristide from returning to Haiti. 
Black thinkers on international issues are highly supportive of the Palestinian cause and troubled by the continued expansion of AFRICOM, the U.S. Africa Command, on the continent. This analysis is glaringly absent from mainstream media portrayals of America‚Äôs ‚Äúduty‚Äù in the world. The Times article offers the view that, ‚ÄúBecause many Americans see their foreign policy as a grand mission to make the world a better place, they tend to divide the world into heroes who support their ideals and villains who oppose them.‚Äù But which Americans are the writers talking about and whose ‚Äúideals‚Äù are represented in U.S. foreign policy. It is certain that the views of people like George Padmore, a leader in the Pan-African movement in the 40‚Äôs and 50‚Äôs, are not represented by this view. Padmore was clear that, ‚ÄúEmpire and peace are incompatible.‚Äù Michael C. Dawson notes, in Blacks in and Out of the Left : ‚Äúfrom Vietnam through Iraq, African Americans have proved to be the group of Americans most opposed to U.S. military intervention.‚Äù It is also purposely ‚Äúforgotten‚Äù that the Black Panther Party was, following in the footsteps of their ideological predecessor, Malcolm X, staunchly anti-imperialist. As Eldridge Cleaver noted, the U.S. was ‚Äúbankrolling and arming all of the oppressive regimes around the world.‚Äù One of the agenda items contained in the National Black Political Agenda, created in Gary, Indiana, in 1972 called for an end to the Vietnam War and the immediate withdrawal of foreign troops from Asia and Africa; the withdrawal of U.S. military, corporations, and communications facilities from southern Africa and the Third World; self-determination of Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands; an end to sanctions against Cuba and the closure of the American military base at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba. 
‚ÄúAfrican Americans were highly critical of the U.S.‚Äôs violent overthrow of the African nation of Libya, its aggressions toward Cuba in the 60‚Äôs and Venezuela in the Chavez era and today.‚Äù 
Contemporary white American analysis of U.S. foreign excludes the historical reality that, in thinking of America‚Äôs support of so-called rebels in Syria and Libya , it is clear to African Americans that America never supported a single African liberation group in Africa. It is not lost on Black Americans that the African National Congress and Nelson Mandela were considered terrorists by the U.S. No African rebel movement seeking independence from the Dutch, British, French, German, Portuguese or Italian colonizers of African lands ever received a single drop of military support from Washington. The U.S. never supported the Mau Mau in Kenya, nor Frelimo in Mozambique, nor the ANC in South Africa, or any other revolutionary movement on the continent. 
In fact, the contrary is true. From the coup against Kwame Nkrumah in Ghana to the assassination of Patrice Lumuumba in the Congo, to the capture of Nelson Mandela and to the support the racist apartheid system of South African and the murderous colonial regime in the former Rhodesia, the American government has consistently and forcefully opposed revolutionary movements in Africa and in fact supported their colonial oppressors. The only country to ever militarily support African liberation was Cuba, not the U.S. Regarding Mandela, (who the U.S. considered a terrorist) we heard him clearly when, in response to a request to condemn Fidel Castro, Yassar Arafat and Mommar Ghadifi, he said, your enemies are not necessarily our enemies. Indeed, not only did Castro send troops to aid the Angolans in defeating the South Africans, he also provided refuge for many African American freedom fighters, from Robert Williams to Assata Shakur. While the U.S. was infiltrating, surveilling and murdering Black political activists in the Black Panther Party, leaders of North Vietnam, China, Algeria and Cuba welcomed them as ambassadors of the African American community. 
‚ÄúIt is clear to African Americans that America never supported a single African liberation group.‚Äù 
Understanding this historical reality, Black thinkers are justifiably critical and suspicious of U.S. intentions in places like Iraq, Iran, Syria and Libya. The greatest thinkers in African American culture explicitly made the connection between the U.S. and European colonialism abroad, in places like Syria, as an extension of the domestic policy of treating African Americans as second class citizens ‚Äì or, as some African American thinkers have argued, the domestic colonization of Black people. The genocide of the Native Americans resonates with Black Americans. Leaders from MLK, who connected America‚Äôs imperialism in Vietnam, and the tax dollars used to support it, to the lack of financial resources available to be used to build cities and provide a basic wage; to Malcolm, who traveled the globe making personal connections with African heads of state, including Nasser in Egypt. It was Malcolm who saw the historic opportunity of the Bandung Conference, where 29 Asian and African, post-colonial nations, met to discuss their own fates independent of colonial powers, including the U.S. 
Black American support for anti-imperialist movements did not find a space in the Times‚Äô analysis of Syria. The writers and editorial staff at the Times are oblivious to the histories of the Third World peoples living in their midst. Therefore, for Black people who understand this history, they recognize articles like the one published in the Times as imperial propaganda pieces for global white supremacy. Yet, the Times , in that regard, is no different than any other white American newspaper, magazine or news program or politician. They all (even, or especially, the Black ones) present a Eurocentric worldview that excludes the ideas, histories and analysis of its black population. We are irrelevant. We serve the function we have always served: subjects of imperialism, scapegoats for repression, but not shapers of foreign policy. Blacks can nominally participate in the American experience, but only so long as we stay in our place and as long as we support the ‚Äúmanifest destiny‚Äù of the global hegemon and not get in its way. We are cannon fodder for the imperialist wars abroad and casualties in the U.S. war on drugs and on poor Black life at home. 
‚ÄúMalcolm traveled the globe making personal connections with African heads of state, including Nasser in Egypt.‚Äù 
The presence of a black face at the head of the empire has provided cover for U.S. imperialism in Africa and Asia, but it has not diminished the anti-imperialism of the black community. It has silenced the voices of the self-appointed black ‚Äúleaders‚Äù and revealed them to be supporters of empire and oppression. The Times , too, or rather again, reveals itself as a supporter of the Pentagon by publishing an article that is short on true analysis of America‚Äôs support of terrorists in Syria, as well as presenting a limited, white supremacist parameter of debate. Although the African American tradition of anti-imperialism may not be important to the Times , it is a tradition that is still alive nonetheless. And neither the Black face of the empire, nor the white press in service to it, can diminish it. Our antagonism against imperialism may not be publicized in the pages of the Times , but it lives on in our continued support for amnesty for Assata Shakur, the release of all political prisoners from Leonard Peltier to Jalil Muntiquim and Oscar Rivera Lopez, to support for Palestinian self-determination, to opposition to the re-colonization of Africa by America‚Äôs Africa Command, to the growing support by Black athletes, young and old, of Colin Kaepernick‚Äôs refusal to stand for the National Anthem, to our opposition to all U.S. wars of aggression, including the ones in Libya and Syria. African Americans‚Äô opposition to the U.S. supported aggression in Syria, masquerading as humanitarian support, is obviously irrelevant to the Times , but Malcolm X told us plainly years ago, that the media would have us thinking the good guy was the bad guy and vice versa. So whether, or even if, Assad is a ‚Äúruthless dictator,‚Äù the term the U.S. has used against everyone from Castro to Chavez, it does not therefore mean that African Americans agree that the U.S. has the right to support insurrection in Syria. We know imperialism is Euro-American, white, capitalist venture that is carried against ‚Äúthe darker nations,‚Äù not for them. Malcolm, Martin and Mandela taught us well. Attorney Bryan K.

Clinton Is the Most Dangerous Person Alive ‚Äì An Interview with Edward S. Herman,"2016 presidential campaign by Ann Garrison 
The just-concluded election revealed as much about the corporate media, which has broken every rule of journalism to support Hillary Clinton, and the fraudulence of much of the American Left, which turns out to have no real problem with war or capitalism, than it did about the candidates, themselves. Edward Herman is an exception, a genuine man of the Left. He says ‚Äúa vote for Hillary Clinton is a vote for war with Syria and Russia.‚Äù Clinton Is the Most Dangerous Person Alive ‚Äì An Interview with Edward S. Herman by Ann Garrison 
‚Äú The election of Hillary Clinton might threaten a democratic order as much as a Trump victory.‚Äù 
Ann Garrison: Earlier this year, you told me that you differ with Noam Chomsky, your co-author of Manufacturing Consent and other books, in that you plan to vote for the Green Party's presidential and vice presidential candidates Jill Stein and Ajamu Baraka in the swing state of Pennsylvania. Are you still planning to do so? 
Edward S. Herman: Yes. 
AG: Can you explain why? 
ESH: Because the two duopoly candidates are dangerous to societal and international welfare and even survival. Hillary Clinton is a neo-liberal and pre-eminent war-monger. I think she is the most dangerous person living in the world today, given her highly likely election victory and her likely performance as president. She represents the corporate elite and military-industrial complex more clearly than Trump and she is a follow-on to Bush and Obama. She will pursue similar policies except for her somewhat more aggressive bent. 
Trump is a self-promoting windbag, racist and dangerous, unpredictable phony. We have a ghastly choice in these two. Jill Stein offers a protest opportunity, more so than not voting. On the line that either voting for Stein or not voting would constitute a vote for Trump, one might argue that a vote for Hillary Clinton is a vote for war with Syria and Russia and a vote for Netanyahu (and hence for escalated violence in Palestine). 
AG: Hillary Clinton and John Podesta's e-mail has revealed that Hillary Clinton is well aware that the Saudi and Qatari rulers - not rogue elements - fund ISIS, and the same Saudi and Qatari rulers fund the Clinton Foundation. Throughout the last George Bush's presidency, there were innumerable headlines that ""Saudi oil sheikhs met with George Bush on his Crawford, Texas ranch."" What are your thoughts on that? 
ESH: Saudi Arabia is a US ally and an instrument of the warfare state. Hillary Clinton has treated its leaders warmly and she will continue to do so as president. The Clinton Foundation's receipt of money from Saudi and Qatari leaders is a first class conflict of interest and outrage, but the media have focused on the many less important abuses of Trump, helping cover over the outrages of their preferred candidate, Hillary Clinton, and her husband, Bill Clinton. 
AG: What do you think of Clinton's statement that she would make removing Bashar Al-Assad her top priority? And Trump's statement that he would not, because that would recklessly risk confrontation with Russia? 
ESH: Hillary Clinton has essentially promised to escalate war in Syria and is therefore promising to go to war with Russia as well. Diana Johnstone has made the case that Hillary Clinton plans to try to bring about ""regime change"" in Russia (cite). This is of course incredibly dangerous and would have aroused a really democratic media, but the existing media are part of the war system, hence Hillary Clinton's commitment to wars is essentially suppressed. Trump has made a number of statements along the lines of reducing US interventions and commitments abroad and trying to deal with Russia in a less confrontational manner, but he has sometimes contradicted himself by urging expanded arms, use of nuclear weapons, etc. But Hillary Clinton has said nothing that would offset her war-mongering. This difference from Trump may help explain the intensity of media hostility to Trump. 
AG: Jill Stein has said that ""wars for oil are blowing back at us wth a vengeance"" and that she would cut the military budget by half, close most of the foreign bases, and redirect resources into a Green New Deal that would fully employ Americans building sustainable energy and agricultural infrastructure. I can't imagine you disagree, but do you think it's important for the Greens to articulate such a vision at the national and international level, instead of focusing solely on local races that they might win? 
ESH: The Greens don't have the resources to compete in many local elections. So she is wise to focus on the big national and international issues. Furthermore, the real gap in the political system is the lack of opposition to national neoliberal and militaristic policies. It is said that she can't make a bigger mark given the hegemony of the duopoly, but even Ralph Nader couldn't get 5 percent of the vote. The system still works well, for the 1%. 
AG : Michael Moore has made a movie called ""Trumpland"" and warned that Trump's election would be the end of the United States , assuming that would be a bad thing. David Swanson, author of ""War Is a Lie,"" has imagined the same but argued, in "" Secession, Trump, and the Avoidability of Civil War ,"" that the break-up of the United States is not the worst possibility on the horizon. Do you have any thoughts on this? 
ESH: Michael Moore is completely oblivious to the fact that the enlarging war that is likely to follow Hillary Clinton's election threatens not only a nuclear exchange but also attacks on civil liberties and the march toward fascism. In its own way, the election of Hillary Clinton might threaten a democratic order as much as a Trump victory. The anti-Trump hysteria has tended to block out consideration of the Hillary Clinton menace. 
AG: Is there anything else you'd like to say about why you're voting for Jill Stein and Ajamu Baraka? 
ESH: I've always believed in the moral rule laid down in the categorical imperative: ""Do that which you would wish generalized."" Ann Garrison an independent journalist based in Oakland, USA.",1
"In Chicago, Teachers and Black Lives Matter Activists Partner to Build a Bigger Movement","Tweet Widget by Leah Fried 
When the Chicago Teachers Union goes on strike, it doesn‚Äôt walk alone; Movement 4 Black Lives organizations have their back. And, when young Black activists campaign against police terror, the teachers union is with them. When it comes to the school-to-prison pipeline, the teachers and Black Youth Project 100 are on the same side. In Chicago, Teachers and Black Lives Matter Activists Partner to Build a Bigger Movement by Leah Fried 
This article previously appeared in Labor Notes . 
‚ÄúTeachers joined protests led by Black Lives Matter and Black Youth Project 100, to disrupt the lucrative Christmas shopping season.‚Äù 
Extracting wins from the boss has never been easy‚Äîand union membership hovering at a low 11 percent isn‚Äôt making it any easier. But a good way to boost our numbers and power is to partner with people who are organized in other ways, building a broader movement as we build our unions. 
For several years the Chicago Teachers Union has put incredible effort into building unity‚Äînot only among its members, but also with parents and neighborhood groups. The results were on display in October as hundreds of volunteers worked daily in the lead-up to a possible strike. 
Parents spoke at press conferences, painted banners, handed out leaflets, distributed T-shirts and yard signs, and talked to other parents. My son‚Äôs elementary school was one of many where parents and kids joined teachers in an early-morning picket. 
One vehicle was the Chicago Teachers Solidarity Campaign, an alliance of dozens of unions and 60 community organizations‚Äîincluding the Chicago chapters of Black Lives Matter and Black Youth Project 100. 
Natural Allies 
Alliances take work, but they can be built on natural connections. ‚ÄúMany of us have either worked or been students in the Chicago Public Schools, or have partners who work for CPS,‚Äù said Aislinn Pulley, a leader in the Black Lives Matter chapter. 
That meant members already understood why public schools are worth fighting for. ‚ÄúA man named Ronald Johnson, who was killed by the police two years ago, had five children who are CPS students,‚Äù said Kofi Ademola, another chapter leader. ‚ÄúThey are in the care of their grandmother, who lives in poverty, and that family is directly impacted by the attacks on public education in our city. 
‚ÄúThe layoff of 1,000 teachers and plan to hire 1,000 more cops was a clear example of the divestment in our communities. They go hand in hand.‚Äù 
The understanding goes both ways. The teachers union has made racial segregation and school underfunding central issues in its contract campaigns. 
District administrators pay lip service to restorative justice, a disciplinary approach that looks for solutions instead of shunting kids into a school-to-prison pipeline. But it‚Äôs the union that has pushed for the funding required to make these programs work. 
CTU and a student group got a grant in 2013 to pilot restorative justice in four schools. In the new tentative agreement, the teachers have won funding to add restorative justice coordinators in 20 to 55 schools. 
In the run-up to the possible strike, the Black Lives Matter chapter spearheaded organizing a Freedom School to offer parents a safe place to send their kids while teachers were out on the picket lines. Chicago State University agreed to donate its space. Planned activities would include a youth town hall. 
The Same Values 
In August the Movement for Black Lives, an umbrella organization that includes Black Lives Matter and other groups, released a policy platform, workshopped with activists from its hundreds of member groups around the country. 
The platform declares the movement‚Äôs support for workers' right to organize unions. It calls for jobs programs, expanding labor laws to protect domestic workers, farm workers, and tipped workers, no Trans-Pacific Partnership, the renegotiation of anti-worker trade agreements, and the rewriting of tax codes so the wealthy pay their share. Unions have much in common with these values. 
Last November, after allegations emerged that the city had covered up video of a police officer killing African American teenager Laquan McDonald, CTU voted to support an elected police-accountability council in Chicago. Teachers joined the protests that followed, led by Black Lives Matter and Black Youth Project 100, to disrupt the lucrative Christmas shopping season. Marchers shut down the Magnificent Mile on Black Friday, chanting, ‚ÄúNo justice, no profit. 
That‚Äôs the kind of partnership Ademola would like to see more of: ‚ÄúHow do we amplify each other‚Äôs message and work together to target the oligarchs that fill the politicians‚Äô war chest?‚Äù",1
When Slaveholders Controlled the Government‚ÄîAn Interview with Matthew Karp,"Tweet Widget by Timothy Shenk 
In order to downgrade the centrality of slavery to the development of the United States and global capitalism, mainstream historians attempt to depict the slaveholding classes as provincial actors. However, the slave owners were the most powerful people in the country. ‚ÄúSoutherners imagined‚Äîand worked to build‚Äîan American republic whose foundation was slavery.‚Äù They wanted a strong United States, with a strong military, to protect slavery. When Slaveholders Controlled the Government ‚Äî An Interview with Matthew Karp 
by Timothy Shenk 
This article previously appeared in Dissent Magazine and Portside . 
‚ÄúIdeologically, slave labor fit in very well in a world increasingly dominated by free trade, expanding European empires, and hardening racist science.‚Äù 
Booked [1] is a monthly series of Q&As with authors by contributing editor Timothy Shenk. For this interview, he spoke with Matthew Karp about This Vast Southern Empire [2] (Harvard University Press, 2016). 
Between 1789 and 1850, the United States had twelve presidents. Ten of them owned slaves; the only two that didn‚Äôt were both named ‚ÄúJohn Adams.‚Äù The United States was a pioneering democracy, but its democracy was shaped by the demands of a slaveholding elite that had immense‚Äîand often decisive‚Äîauthority over its government. Princeton historian Matthew Karp explores the consequences of this arrangement in This Vast Southern Empire . He focuses on the influence Southerners wielded over foreign policy, but Karp‚Äôs inquiry opens up new perspectives on much more, including the dynamics of proslavery ideology, the world-making ambitions of Southern elites, and the origins of a Civil War that broke American democracy in two. It is a history driven by the intertwined forces of white supremacy, state power, and coerced labor‚Äîand it is a history that would persist long after the Confederacy‚Äôs demise. 
Timothy Shenk: When Americans talked about a ‚Äúvast Southern empire‚Äù before the Civil War, what did they have in mind? 
Matthew Karp: The short answer is that they weren‚Äôt talking about an independent Southern republic, but the entire United States. 
It‚Äôs easy to find sectionalism in Southern politics before the Civil War, but the most powerful antebellum Southerners‚Äîfrom Andrew Jackson to Jefferson Davis‚Äîwere nationalists, not separatists. What John C. Calhoun really wanted, as Richard Hofstadter wrote long ago, was not for Southerners to leave the Union but to dominate it, which they more or less did in the thirty years before the Civil War. 
Southerners imagined‚Äîand worked to build‚Äîan American republic whose foundation was slavery. In their minds, this was a powerful state, continental in scope and hemispheric in influence, which put the preservation of slaveholding property at the center of U.S. politics and U.S. foreign policy. That‚Äôs what they meant by ‚Äúthis vast Southern empire,‚Äù and that‚Äôs the focus of the book. 
Shenk: Especially in popular discussions, slaveholders are often seen as advocates of small government and states‚Äô rights. What does looking at the foreign policy visions promoted by leading proslavery figures do to that image? 
Karp: It‚Äôs true that in many antebellum political arguments, Southern leaders emphasized the limited powers of the federal government. But when slavery and states‚Äô rights came into conflict, the abstract commitment to limited government vanished pretty quickly. The outstanding example is the Fugitive Slave Act of 1850, which overrode personal liberty laws in the northern states and required federal marshals to assist slaveholders in capturing runaway slaves. 
You can look at this and say, ‚ÄúAha, they‚Äôre hypocrites!‚Äù But the use of federal power to defend slavery went far beyond hypocrisy‚Äîit was a cornerstone of antebellum Southern politics. Looking at U.S. foreign policy makes this especially clear. On many important questions of foreign relations‚Äîthe annexation of Texas, for instance‚Äîsupposed small-government ideologues suddenly morphed into bold advocates of federal power. Proslavery Southerners also served as by far the most aggressive champions of U.S. military and naval expansion. They didn‚Äôt do this because they were hypocrites, but because they believed the world‚Äôs strongest bulwark for slavery was not the weak state governments of the South, but the entire United States. 
Shenk: One of the most fascinating characters in this book, and in all of U.S. history, is John C. Calhoun. He was the most incisive thinker the plantation elite had‚ÄîRichard Hofstadter called him ‚Äúthe Marx of the master class‚Äù‚Äîand he‚Äôs a central figure in your account. What do we learn about Calhoun by bringing his foreign policy into the spotlight? 
Karp: We think of Calhoun as the quintessential antebellum Southern sectionalist. But from the perspective of foreign and military policy, he was much closer to a bold proslavery nationalist. As Secretary of State, he pushed aggressively for Texas annexation, bypassing Congress (and cutting constitutional corners) to offer military aid to Texas in 1844. Through the antebellum years he remained a relatively consistent advocate for army and navy expansion. 
Sometimes we imagine Southern slaveholders like Calhoun as isolated elites, barricaded in the parlors of their plantation homes. But Calhoun was also a bold proslavery internationalist . He paid close attention to the politics of slavery and abolition in Europe and in Latin America, and he was very assiduous about directing U.S. power to sustain slavery in Cuba and Brazil. For him, the international strength of slavery and the international strength of the United States were tightly bound together. 
Shenk: Recent historians have paid a lot of attention to the commercial relationships that bound the United States and the United Kingdom before the Civil War. As you note in the book, during this period ‚ÄúBritain was the world‚Äôs largest consumer of goods produced by American slaves.‚Äù But you also observe that this was the same period when the UK both abolished slavery and embarked on a renewed drive to establish a global empire. From the perspective of the American South, this combination seemed like a total jumble of ideological, cultural, and economic issues that the UK would have to sort out if they wanted to develop a coherent vision of their country‚Äôs place in the world. And it gets even more confusing when you remember that figures like Calhoun had spent most of 1812 pushing for a disastrous war with Britain. How did slavery‚Äôs defenders make sense of all this? 
Karp: Southern elites saw Britain as both a vital commercial partner and a potentially dangerous strategic enemy. That‚Äôs not necessarily incoherent, but it is confusing. It helps to approach Southern attitudes toward Britain from a chronological perspective. 
It‚Äôs hard to overstate the importance of the British abolition of slavery in 1833. Overnight, the policy of the world‚Äôs most powerful empire was now distinctly hostile toward one of America‚Äôs most fundamental institutions. In the early 1840s, Southern leaders in and around the administration of President John Tyler believed that defending slavery against British abolitionism should be a top strategic priority for the United States. There were many dimensions to this effort, from naval expansion to Cuba diplomacy, but in some sense it culminated with the U.S. annexation of the Republic of Texas, which was in 1845 the fourth largest slaveholding society in the world. 
By the 1850s, after the Texas annexation and the U.S.-Mexico war, the strategic situation had changed. Slaveholders were cheered by the apparent ‚Äúfailure‚Äù of emancipation in the West Indies‚Äîobviously, it wasn‚Äôt a failure for the emancipated slaves, but sugar production in Jamaica and elsewhere plummeted after abolition. Across the 1850s, slaveholding leaders eagerly reprinted evidence that Britain had soured on abolition, and was ready to accept the dominance of slave-produced staples (from the United States, Cuba, and Brazil) in the world market. This was a somewhat optimistic view, but by 1861, Southerners sincerely viewed Britain much more as a commercial partner than as a strategic rival. 
Shenk: For a long time, historians tended to think of the antebellum South as an almost feudal holdover from the past that could not stand up to the forces of modernity. In the last decade or so, however, scholars have become much more likely to depict it as thoroughly modern. Where does your research fall in that debate? 
Karp: You‚Äôre right about the tendency of the recent scholarship. In a lot of ways, my book is congruent with that work, although I do think there are limits to a social or economic interpretation of slavery that concentrates entirely on its modern characteristics. 
Really, though, the book is less about whether slavery was or was not ‚Äúmodern,‚Äù and more about the fact that leading slaveholders believed it was. I like what the historian Frederick Cooper says: scholars should stop ‚Äúshoehorning political discourse into modern, antimodern, or postmodern discourses‚Äù and instead ‚Äúlisten to what is being said in the world.‚Äù What slaveholders said, over and over again, was that ‚Äúmodern civilization‚Äù and African slavery were fundamentally compatible. Economically, they argued, slave labor was necessary to produce vital agricultural staples. And ideologically, slave labor fit in very well in a world increasingly dominated by free trade, expanding European empires, and hardening racist science. I think the most powerful slaveholding politicians‚ÄîCalhoun, Jefferson Davis, Alexander Stephens, and so on‚Äîbelieved this most of all. We have to understand that belief to understand antebellum politics. 
Shenk: By 1861, elite Southerners were no longer convinced the United States could serve as the agent of their interests, and so they break off to form the Confederacy. You argue that we should see the launching of the Confederate States of America as their ‚Äúboldest foreign policy project.‚Äù What do we gain by thinking of the Confederacy in this way? 
Karp: Slaveholding leaders didn‚Äôt want to abandon the Union. But their grip on the federal government was overthrown by the election of Abraham Lincoln and the Republican Party in 1860. Suddenly the power of the national state‚Äîwhich they had spent decades building up‚Äîcould be used to not to strengthen slavery, but to undermine it. 
All the same, I don‚Äôt think Southerners would have seceded without the confident belief that a slaveholding Confederacy could thrive on the world stage. In the book I look at two of the most famous Southern documents from early 1861‚Äîthe Mississippi declaration of secession [3] and Confederate Vice President Alexander Stephens‚Äôs ‚Äú cornerstone address [4].‚Äù Both are very candid about the central importance of slavery, and in contemporary discussions they are often brandished as clear evidence that slavery, not state rights, drove Southerners to secede (like the way Jon Stewart cites [5] the Mississippi declaration in this [5] episode of the Daily Show). 
That‚Äôs all true, but what‚Äôs most interesting about these documents is that they make a fundamentally international case for slavery. ‚ÄúOur position is thoroughly identified with the institution of slavery‚Äîthe greatest material interest of the world‚Äù: that‚Äôs the second sentence of the Mississippi declaration. It wasn‚Äôt just that slaveholders believed Britain and other European powers would come to their aid in a war against the North, although they did believe that. It was that their entire ideological and strategic worldview depended on a belief in the global necessity of slave labor. European states might oppose slavery in the abstract, but they could not escape the deeper principle of racial inequality upon which slavery rested. ‚ÄúThe truth of this principle may be slow in development,‚Äù Stephens admitted in his famous address, but so was the case with the controversial principles of Galileo or Adam Smith. Ultimately, he and other Confederate leaders were confident that the fundamental ideas of racial hierarchy and coerced labor would receive ‚Äúfull recognition . . . throughout the civilized and enlightened world.‚Äù That international confidence, I think, was a true ideological cornerstone of the Confederate project. 
Shenk: The book‚Äôs epigraph comes from Karl Marx‚Äî‚ÄúIn the foreign, as in the domestic policy of the United States, the interests of the slaveholders served as the guiding star‚Äù‚Äîand its footnotes are studded with classic works of Marxist scholarship, but your methodology here doesn‚Äôt follow the standard practice among Marxists. Your concern is with policymaking elites, and while you‚Äôre clearly aware that their work isn‚Äôt taking place in a vacuum, you‚Äôre not trying to write a history from the bottom up. Is there a contribution that you‚Äôre trying to make by shifting the angle of focus? 
Karp: Part of the issue here is that the literature on slavery and the Old South is, in some ways, the richest literature in U.S. history‚Äîthe crown jewel of American historiography, as I‚Äôve heard it described. And the best books on Southern politics, from the 1960s to the 2000s (many of them written from a Marxist or Marx-ish perspective), have been grounded very firmly in the social world of the antebellum South. 
I would say that my book‚Äôs focus on elite actors and elite sources should not be seen as a criticism of that literature, but an indirect appreciation of its richness. Historians are so accustomed‚Äîas we should be‚Äîto viewing slaveholders at the top of a complex pyramid of class, racial, and gender hierarchies in Southern society, that for a long time, we forgot that they were also the nation‚Äôs most powerful political leaders, and the world‚Äôs most powerful slaveholding class. Only in the past fifteen years or so have historians begun to look more systematically at slaveholders as leading national and international actors, as well as Southern social elites. Done right, I think, these approaches don‚Äôt contradict each other‚Äîthey complement each other. 
Shenk: You end the book by discussing a speech by that W.E.B. Du Bois gave at Harvard‚Äôs 1890 commencement, when he was twenty-two. In his address, Du Bois portrayed the Confederacy‚Äôs president Jefferson Davis as not just a successful politician but as the representative product of a whole civilization. Thirteen years after he made this argument, Du Bois wrote in The Souls of Black Folk , ‚Äúthe problem of the twentieth century is the problem of the color line.‚Äù Do you see a connection running from the history you examine here and the world that Du Bois saw at the turn of the twentieth century? 
Karp: Du Bois titled his 1890 address ‚Äú Jefferson Davis as a Representative of Civilization [6],‚Äù and by that he meant, provocatively, not just the civilization of the Old South, but all contemporary Western civilization itself. Davis‚Äôs life and career, according to Du Bois, prefigured the major world developments of the turn of the twentieth century‚Äîthe destruction of indigenous populations, the strengthening of a global color line, the extension of Euro-American empires over Asia, Africa, and Australia. It‚Äôs an incredibly powerful and ambitious speech for anyone to give, let alone a twenty-two year old undergraduate. 
Many historians would object to Du Bois‚Äôs intellectual genealogy here. Davis‚Äôs side, after all, lost the Civil War: the Confederacy was destroyed and slavery was abolished. The leading players in the world of 1890‚Äîfrom industrial tycoons from to European imperialists‚Äîseemingly owed little to Jefferson Davis or the slave South. U.S. President Benjamin Harrison was himself a Union Army veteran, who had marched with General Sherman into Georgia. 
But what I like about Du Bois‚Äôs speech is that he refuses, unlike so many later writers, to consign Davis to a distant and departed past, entirely walled off from the twentieth-century future. Davis and other slaveholding elites thought and acted as power players in a rapidly modernizing world. Their battlefield defeat should not blind us to the ways in which many of their core ideas‚Äîabout racial hierarchy, coerced labor, and imperial state power‚Äîsurvived long after 1865. 
That doesn‚Äôt mean that the Civil War, Confederate defeat, and slave emancipation were irrelevant. If anything, it underlines their significance. The larger point, though, is that when we look back at Davis and his ilk, we should not regard them as antiquarian curiosities, but as ambitious contenders for power in an uncertain mid-nineteenth century world. 
Shenk: Historians know you as a specialist in the antebellum South, but in the wider world you‚Äôre better known for your writings on contemporary politics, especially for your essays in Jacobin , which were some of the sharpest analyses of the Bernie Sanders campaign in this entire election cycle. On the surface, at least, those two don‚Äôt seem to have a lot in common. Do you see any common threads running through the two? What was it like wrapping up this book while also spending so much time with your feet planted in 2016? 
Karp: I‚Äôm not sure they do have much in common! I turned in my final draft of the book in January, just as the Democratic primary really got underway and Sanders emerged as a surprising contender for the nomination. It was fortunate timing, because after working on the book for years, I now had some free time to get involved in contemporary politics. 
To the extent that there is a connection between these things, it might have to do with my sense of slaveholders as a nineteenth-century ruling class. Our most powerful elites today are very different, and I don‚Äôt want to make a serious analogy between the two. But in the very general sense that slaveholders were a small and self-conscious class, nationally powerful, internationally sophisticated, and totally confident in the future of their system‚Äîdespite various warning signs all around the globe‚Äîtheir outlook is, in some ways, comparable to the outlook of today‚Äôs big capitalist class. And control of the American national state was‚Äîas it remains today‚Äîabsolutely fundamental to the operation of ruling class power. 
I agree with other historians and commentators, like Manisha Sinha [7] and Chris Hayes [8], that the contemporary left could stand to learn from the anti-slavery movement. The key, though, is not only to isolate and weaken the gun lobby or fossil fuel industry, for instance, but to develop a popular and more comprehensive critique [9] of the political-economic system‚Äîa twenty-first century version of the ‚ÄúSlave Power‚Äù argument. Slaveholders, after all, didn‚Äôt just represent a sector of the economy; they controlled the government. For all its weaknesses, I do think the Sanders campaign represented a major step forward in this larger project, and I‚Äôm probably unreasonably optimistic about the possibilities going forward.

The Deteriorating Situation in Ethiopia,"Tweet Widget by Yohannes Woldemariam 
The minority ethnic regime in Ethiopia now faces multiple rebellions. The regime‚Äôs foreign friends are part of the problem. ‚ÄúFaced with increased intrusion into their lands by so-called international investors, by displacement and by the breakdown of their social fabric, Ethiopians are mobilizing to resist.‚Äù The once formidable government coalition ‚Äúis beginning to unravel.‚Äù The Deteriorating Situation in Ethiopia by Yohannes Woldemariam 
This article previously appeared in Pambazuka News . 
‚Äú The revolts are widespread and they appear beyond the power of the state to control and put down.‚Äù 
The revolts in Ethiopia have the potential for creating radical, beneficial changes in the political order or instigating complete chaos that crosses its borders and destabilizes the entire fragile Horn of Africa region, for the outcomes of such uprisings have varied considerably from country to country. These protests can be the catalyst for building a new and democratic Ethiopia or end up in tears and disillusionment, as in Libya, South Sudan and many other places in the world. Countries emerging from dictatorships are particularly vulnerable and Ethiopia is certainly under a vicious dictatorship. 
The events in Ethiopia are being described as ‚ÄúIntifada,‚Äù ‚ÄúEthiopian Spring‚Äù or as something akin to the Color Revolutions in the Ukraine and Georgia and the 1989 Tiananmen Square protests in China. During the uprising in 2005 protesting the rigged election, the late chief of the Tigrean Peoples‚Äô Liberation Front (TPLF) and Prime Minister, Meles Zenawi, did say that there would not be any more Color Revolutions in Ethiopia. That uprising was put down with hundreds dead and thousands in concentration camps. 
This time, however, the revolts are widespread and they appear beyond the power of the state to control and put down. Apparently, Mr. Zenawi spoke prematurely. Technological innovation is a very important part of this current political mass mobilization, which is why the government has moved with cutting Ethiopia off from the internet and dismantling satellite dishes from the homes of ordinary citizens. Drawing on satellite television, mobile phones and the Internet, the revolts are spreading. Within seconds, activists send their messages against the tyranny. Unsurprisingly, the TPLF oligarchy is extremely fearful of social media websites like Facebook, Twitter and the diaspora media. 
In this piece, I want to reflect on three points: 
1. The celebrity factor: Feyisa Lilesa versus Prime Minister Halemariam Desalegn 
2. Mr. Abay Tsehaye‚Äôs reference to Rwanda 
3. The newly declared State of Emergency 
The celebrity factor: Feyisa Lilesa versus Prime Minister Halemariam Desalegn 
In the wake of the Rio Olympics, the profile of the Ethiopian uprising got a boost from Feyisa Lilesa , with his heroic act of crossing his arms on winning the silver medal for marathon, a signature symbol of solidarity of the oppressed Oromo nation to which Feyisa belongs. The influence of the celebrity athlete for social change is formidable, and Feyisa has emerged as a powerful voice for the struggle of his Oromo people, causing nervous shivers in the beleaguered regime. What the death and imprisonment of thousands of Oromos couldn‚Äôt accomplish in Ethiopia was achieved by his symbolic act at the finish line. Now the whole world is clued into the terrible conditions in Ethiopia and beginning to learn about the plight of the Oromo people. 
Other Ethiopian athletes have since used their successes to follow suit. Ebsa Ejigu, Tamiru Demissie and Hirut Guangul have used their international successes to publicize the plight of their country‚Äôs men and women to an international audience. This trend is likely to continue now as other athletes and celebrities are losing their fear of retaliation and becoming more and more willing to participate in what has become a growing national movement. Yes, these athletes will pay a price. Lilesa is now separated from his wife and children and beckoning an unknown fate. Life in exile will not be easy even for famous athletes. But compared to those losing lives and limbs to bullets in Ethiopia, it is a small price to pay. They are heroes, and their names are already inscribed in history books. 
‚ÄúThese athletes will pay a price.‚Äù 
The TPLF reaction to Lilesa‚Äôs heroic act can be gleaned from statements given by PM Hailemariam Desalegn. Although the PM is from the Wolayta ethnic group, which was traditionally relegated to the periphery of the Ethiopian mainstream, he has become a willing accomplice and spokesman for the TPLF. Most people regard him as an accidental PM who happened to be in the right place and at the right time when his powerful boss, PM Meles Zenawi, passed away in the summer of 2012. He was handpicked as Zenawi‚Äôs deputy because he wasn‚Äôt a threat and, as a non-Tigrean, served as a convenient cover and a token representing ‚Äúdiversity‚Äù for the TPLF. He is so loyal to the late PM, he still refers to the Meles ‚Äúvision‚Äù in his public pronouncements. Most Ethiopians know that he is just a figurehead with no real power. Yet, in an interview conducted with the online Foreign Policy.com, he is quoted as saying: 
‚ÄúIt‚Äôs me who sent [Lilesa] to Rio for the Olympics, and we expected him to come back after winning the medal. . . . [T]his is not the capacity of the man himself. It‚Äôs something which has been orchestrated by someone else from outside.‚Äù 
It is remarkable that the PM has the audacity to say he sent Feyisa Lilesa to the Olympics, as if Feyisa needed his charitable permission. It is crystal clear that Feyisa earned his place in the Olympics. 
One can readily concede that he may have acquiesced to nepotism by sending to the Olympics the unqualified son of the head of the sports federation, Robel Kiros Habte , who made Ethiopia a laughing stock with his hopeless performance in a swimming race. But no one can doubt that Feyisa went to the Olympics because he was Ethiopia‚Äôs best hope for the marathon. And he delivered in no unmistakable terms by winning a silver medal competing with the best and the elites in the world. It is hard to believe that Desalegn referring to Feyisa actually said: ‚ÄúThis is not the capacity of the man himself‚Äù ‚Äì thus exposing his own pomposity, shallowness and contempt for the Oromo hero. Clearly, Desalegn has sold his soul to the TPLF devil. To suggest that Feyisa cannot think for himself and act on his own is inexcusably ignorant and arrogant and unbecoming of a prime minster. 
‚ÄúDesalegn is a sellout with little dignity, reading and parroting whatever script is given to him by the TPLF.‚Äù 
Feyisa is not only a fine athlete; he is also a dignified, proud, principled and articulate Oromo and Ethiopian, as he amply demonstrated during the press conference in the Washington D.C. rally where Congressman Chris Smith also spoke. Also, in a direct reply to the PM‚Äôs insult, Feyisa quipped: 
‚ÄúI was not surprised by his comments because individuals who are always controlled by others tend to assume everyone is that way as well. . . . Unlike the prime minister, I make my own decisions and speak for myself.‚Äù 
Indeed, Desalegn is a sellout with little dignity, reading and parroting whatever script is given to him by the TPLF. The pretentious PM has replaced the real world with a make-believe virtual world. It is for this reason that he is unable to see realities on the ground; he is temporarily sheltered behind a wall whose mortar is sychophantic servitude and a wicked willingness to say and do anything to appease his TPLF benefactors. 
It is beyond regrettable that Desalegn is unable to see the rapid downside toward further chaos and civil war in Ethiopia that is due to the abject misery and oppression suffered by the people who are subjected to the policies of those he is serving and to whom he has sold his soul. He calls himself a born-again Christian with a straight face. How would Jesus himself, who stood up to the hypocritical Pharisees and threw the money-changers out of the temple in Jerusalem, have regarded a man like Desalegn, who is in bed with the TPLF elites who are the modern day equivalent of the Pharisees in Ethiopia and whose words and actions rarely match? The human suffering that is the result of the violent and continuous repression cannot be seen from inside their ideological castles resting on the thin air of empty rhetoric and shameless self-promotion. 
Desalegn would be well advised to keep his mouth closed to spare himself more disgrace. He has already sunk into the deep end of an abyss. It is depressing to see a human being selling out his people and becoming a slave of oppressors. 
Invoking the specter of Rwanda 
The TPLF ideologue and one of the real powers behind the throne, Mr. Abay Tsehaye, in an interview with the pro-government Radio Fana, compared the situation of Rwanda in the early 90s to the current situation in Ethiopia. He correctly stated that Rwanda was comprised of only two ethnic groups (the Hutu and the Tutsi), really not much of a country, and was on the verge of disintegration. He went on to say that reconciliation occurred and the country recovered. In Ethiopia with over eighty ethnic groups, if the situation goes ‚Äúout of control,‚Äù he concluded, Ethiopia will cease to exist as a country. Every thoughtful person worries about this. However, one can reasonably surmise from his analysis that Ethiopia under the control of his Tigray-dominated government, who make up only six percent of the Ethiopian population, is his guarantee for holding the country together. Mr. Tsehaye fails to recognize the draconian hegemonic policies of his regime as the very reasons for the grim state of affairs in the country. As the Ethiopian uprising makes clear, the various ethnicities are no longer buying TPLF shenanigans and see the TPLF itself as the main cause of Ethiopia‚Äôs predicament, as the country descends into possible civil war. 
For anyone willing to see the truth, Ethiopia is in a state of turmoil due to the exploitation of the long-suffering people of Oromia, Ogaden, Gambella and other ethnic groups by the TPLF elite in partnership with international enablers such as China and the United States, the principal rivals in Africa and the Horn region. The TPLF exploitation, in which valuable resources and political roles are dominated by a minority elite that has transformed itself into an oligarchy, has created highly rebellious resentment by the victims while reinforcing a sense of ethnic identity and consciousness. Faced with increased intrusion into their lands by so-called international investors, by the displacement and stunted developments they experience and by the breakdown of their social fabric, Ethiopians are mobilizing to resist. 
‚ÄúThe various see the TPLF itself as the main cause of Ethiopia‚Äôs predicament, as the country descends into possible civil war.‚Äù 
The government‚Äôs state-driven development projects financed by international investors and partners bypass the rural peasants and pastoralists, alienating the people and reinforcing the politics of deep ethnic hierarchy. Recent events have made it clear that TPLF‚Äôs ‚Äúconstitutional federalism‚Äù has more to do with its divide-and-rule strategy and its elitist allocation of national resources, comparable to actions of the former Soviet Communist Party, which retained tight control over its regions through local parties. The TPLF set up People‚Äôs Democratic Organizations, local versions of the ruling party, which squeezed out traditional authority. 
The co-opted ethnic leaders from these regions have either completely lost credibility, are sitting on the fence, or are jumping ship to support the resistance. Key former government figures like Junedin Sado are breaking their silence and speaking out with scathing attacks on the regime. He has apologized to the Ethiopian people for the time that he served under the regime. The so- called coalition that the TPLF built is beginning to unravel. Some Amhara and some Oromo are coming together against the TPLF, overcoming but not necessarily forgetting, the legacy of the historic oppression by Amhara elites which began with Menelik II. 
Abay Tsehaye and TPLF leaders will need to face reality ‚Äî if they have it in them to be truly concerned about Ethiopian unity. Oromo historical grievances are not myths, as some revisionist history asserts. Oromo land is the most fertile and lush in Ethiopia, in contrast to the northern Ethiopian highlands with its rugged mountains and thin soils contributing relatively little to national economic production, but the Oromo have been alienated from control over their land throughout the 20th century first by the Amhara and now by the new TPLF overlords. 
Acutely divided societies in which no single faction can impose its view might find an ability to arrive at political compromises in a constitutional form. But in Ethiopia, the hegemonic Amhara and now the Tigreans have excluded others from real power-sharing making true constitutionalism elusive. The leaders see the state as a prize to be won, a basis for private accumulation and patronage. But there is not enough patronage to go around, and those excluded from it mobilize their co-religionists and ethnic groups in an increasingly unmanageable opposition. 
The State of Emergency 
In response, the TPLF is relying on intensified repression by security forces, ethnic loyalists and the army. And for the first time in twenty-five years, the regime has declared a State of Emergency , clearly showing how rattled it is by the rebellion in the country. The Prime Minster announced : 
‚ÄúThe cause of this (state of emergency) is that anti-peace forces in collaboration with foreign enemies of the country are making organized attempts to destabilize our country, to disrupt its peace and also to undermine the existence and security of its peoples.‚Äù 
This response undoubtedly means more sticks and further erosion of civil liberties in the country but is unlikely to quell the unrest. One of the targets of the State of Emergency is the Internet and Social Media. PM Desalegn did make it a point to rant against diaspora media and the Internet during his appearance in September at the United Nations General Assembly: 
‚ÄúIn fact, we are seeing how misinformation could easily go viral via social media and mislead many people, especially the youth‚Ä¶Social media has certainly empowered populists and other extremists to exploit people‚Äôs genuine concerns and spread their message of hate and bigotry without any inhibition...it is critical to underline one matter which is usually given short shrift, both by the media and others. It is simply hypocritical to deny that some of our countries have been targets for destabilization activities carried out with no accountability by people and groups who have been given shelters by States with whom we have absolutely no problems.‚Äù 
The regime that Desalegn serves is responsible for suffocating the Ethiopian people by denying them any alternative media. The Ethiopian government is one of the top jailers and harassers of anyone daring to publish or practice independent journalism within the country. Now, Desalegn is shedding his crocodile tears about his inability to control and suppress social media and broadcasting emanating from the diaspora. While he has a point about the inherent potential for the abuse of social media, the regime is responsible for bringing criticisms on itself. In the absence of media freedom in the country, social media and broadcasting from the diaspora acquired enormous significance for Ethiopians hungry for information. It is clear that Ethiopians no longer trust the regime and have little confidence in official government news, which in reality is mostly propaganda. 
‚ÄúThe Ethiopian government is one of the top jailers and harassers of anyone daring to publish or practice independent journalism.‚Äù 
Authoritarian regimes adopt various forms of censorship to depoliticize the population and prevent the questioning of their legitimacy. By definition, authoritarian regimes demand strict submission by the media to their political authority. They do so by publishing or broadcasting deceptions in order to maintain their power structures. For example, the regime‚Äôs media censored Feyisa‚Äôs symbolic gesture in Rio while proclaiming that Feyisa is a national hero and welcome to return home, without any consequences. 
The advent of the Internet has somewhat leveled the playing field by empowering regular Internet users to become content producers by utilizing decentralized and distributed networks such as social media. These uses of media pose a great danger to dictatorial regimes, which are moving to subvert, block social media and limit internet use, as in Ethiopia today. 
China is the leading culprit in creating the technology to enable censorship, which it is sharing with the Ethiopian government. This suppression of the media will not succeed. Freedom-loving people find ways to circumvent these barriers and make determined efforts to stay informed ‚Äì and, in turn, to inform the whole world. Yohannes Woldemariam is an educator and author.

Freedom Rider: Dump the Democrats for Good,"2016 presidential campaign by BAR editor and senior columnist Margaret Kimberley 
Donald Trump, the white nationalist that claimed to oppose the corporate establishment, appears to have won the U.S. presidency. But, ‚Äúeven the victory of the openly bigoted Trump poses an opportunity to right our political ship.‚Äù The Democrats were not ‚Äúour‚Äù party, but the party that thought they owned us. Their ‚Äúrejection must be complete and blame must be laid squarely at their feet‚Äù for raising those chickens that have come home to roost. Freedom Rider: Dump the Democrats for Good by BAR editor and senior columnist Margaret Kimberley 
‚ÄúThe Democrats were so entrenched in their corruption and self-dealing that they didn‚Äôt see the Bernie Sanders campaign for modest reform as the savior it might have been.‚Äù 
This columnist did not see a Donald Trump victory coming. The degree of disgust directed at an awful candidate was more than I had predicted. Neither the corporate media, nor Wall Street nor the pundits nor the pollsters saw this coming either. Their defeat and proof of their uselessness is total. Those of us who rejected the elite consensus and didn‚Äôt support Hillary Clinton should be proud. 
Black people are now in fear and in shock when we ought to be spoiling for a fight. All is not lost. Even the victory of the openly bigoted Trump poses an opportunity to right our political ship. Not the electoral ship, the political one. For decades black Americans have been voting for people who have done them wrong. Bill Clinton got rid of public assistance as a right, and undid regulations that kept Wall Street in check. He put black people in jail and yet black people didn‚Äôt turn on him until he and his wife tried to defeat Obama. But Obama gave us more of the same. Bailouts of Wall Street, interventions and death for people all over the world, and a beat down of black people who still loved him. Despite the fear of Republican victory we end up losing whenever a Democratic presidential candidate wins. 
‚ÄúObama bailed out banks, insurance companies, Big Pharma and even Ukraine.‚Äù 
Victory is ours if we dump the Democrat Party and their black misleaders. The Democrats were so entrenched in their corruption and self-dealing that they didn‚Äôt see the Bernie Sanders campaign for modest reform as the savior it might have been. Instead they marched in lock step with a woman who was heartily disliked. Sanders went along as the sheep dog who led his flock straight over the cliff. The Democrats inadvertently galvanized people who had stopped participating in the system and who want change from top to bottom. 
One of our biggest problems lies not in facts but in perceptions. What did Democrats do for black people? The Democrats ship living wage jobs off shore in corrupt trade deals like NAFTA and TTP. They don‚Äôt prosecute killer cops or raise the minimum wage. Trump will be hard pressed to deport more people than Obama did. The list of treachery is very long. 
When Donald Trump asked black people, ‚ÄúWhat have you got to lose?‚Äù his words were met with derision. But in reality he posed a good question. What do we have to show for years of Democratic votes? Obama bailed out banks, insurance companies, Big Pharma and even Ukraine. But he didn‚Äôt rebuild Detroit or New Orleans. The water in Flint, Michigan is still poisoned and the prisons are still full. 
‚ÄúThere may be opportunity in this crisis if we dare to seize it.‚Äù 
The outpouring of love for Barack Obama was purely symbolic. In state after state, black people who gave him victory in 2008 and 2012 stayed home. They loved seeing him and his wife dressed up at state dinners but they were never fully engaged in politics because that is not what Democrats want. The love was phony and void of any political intent. Donald Trump will be president because of that veneer of political activism. 
As for white people who voted for Trump, of course many of them are racists. However they are not without valid complaints. They don‚Äôt want neoliberalism but black people don‚Äôt either. They don‚Äôt want wars around the world and neither do black people. We corrupt our own heritage of radicalism in favor of shallow symbolism. While we slept walk in foolish nostalgia for Obama and cried at the thought of him leaving office, white people kept their hatred of Hillary to themselves or lied to pollsters. They want America to be great again, great for them. White nostalgic yearnings are dangerous for black people, and we must be vigilant. But there may be opportunity in this crisis if we dare to seize it. 
Republicans have been the white people‚Äôs party for nearly 50 years. Trump just made it more obvious. He didn‚Äôt tell us anything we didn‚Äôt already know. We don‚Äôt have to be the losers in this election. Let us remember what we have achieved in our history. Half of black Americans didn‚Äôt even have the right to vote in the 1960s yet made earth shattering progress in a short time. But we must understand the source of that progress. It came from struggle and daring to create the crises that always bring about change. 
‚ÄúThe dread of redneck celebration should not be our primary motivation right now.‚Äù 
Yes white people will strut for president Trump but that doesn‚Äôt mean we must submit as if we are in the Jim Crow days of old. We have ourselves to rely on and we can reclaim our history of fighting for self-determination. The dread of redneck celebration should not be our primary motivation right now. Before we quake in fear at white America we must send the scoundrels packing. 
The black politicians and the Democratic National Committee and the civil rights organizations that don‚Äôt help the masses must all be kicked to the proverbial curb. The rejection must be complete and blame must be laid squarely at their feet. 
Those of us who voted for the green party ticket of Jill Stein and Ajamu Baraka must stand firmly and proudly for our choice. We must strategize on building a progressive party to replace the Democrats who never help us. We must applaud Julian Assange and Wikileaks for exposing their corruption. There should be no back tracking on the fight to build left wing political power. 
‚ÄúWe must strategize on building a progressive party to replace the Democrats who never help us.‚Äù 
The black people who didn‚Äôt return to the polls shouldn‚Äôt be blamed either. Those individuals must have personal introspection that is meaningful and political. Their lack of enthusiasm speaks to Democratic Party and black misleadership incompetence. We should refrain from personal blame and help one another in this process as we fight for justice and peace. 
The end of the duopoly is the first step in liberation. Staying with a party that literally did nothing was a slow and agonizing death. Sometimes shock therapy is needed to improve one‚Äôs condition. If we don‚Äôt take the necessary steps to free ourselves this election outcome will be a disaster. Instead, why not bring the disaster to the people who made it happen? The destruction of the Democratic Party and creation of a truly progressive political movement is the only hope for black America.

The Anatomy of Crisis and the Decline of US Empire,"The Anatomy of Crisis and the Decline of US Empire Submitted by Danny Haiphong on Tue, 11/08/2016 - 12:18 Tweet Widget by Danny Haiphong 
There are multiple dimensions to the crisis that afflicts U.S. imperialism. The latest election is evidence of a crisis of legitimacy for the ruling parties. Americans are estranged from a government that spies on every one its citizens ‚Äì and on the rest of the world, too. ‚ÄúUnemployment, poverty, racist state repression, and war are all the system has to offer.‚Äù Unable to escape a 40-year economic slump, the U.S. instead plots the destruction of its rivals. The Anatomy of Crisis and the Decline of US Empire by Danny Haiphong 
‚Äú The vast majority of oppressed communities, particularly Black workers, have seen their labor become disposable in a post-industrial society.‚Äù 
Whether one analyzes the economic, military, or political spheres of US imperialism, one thing is abundantly clear. The very fabric of the United States is in deep crisis. The crisis is largely misunderstood by the vast majority of working and oppressed people living under it. But a specter haunts the US and it isn't anything like Hollywood's scary movies. That specter is the possibility that the people will become a conscious force of opposition to the crisis and seek to dismantle the system of capitalist empire that governs it. 
Crises are genuinely thought of in economic terms. The economic base of capitalism is indeed suffering from protracted economic crisis. The US capitalist economy, and thus the world capitalist economy pegged to its hip, entered a period of stagnation in the mid to late 1970s. What followed was a slowdown in production facilitated by the increased monopolization, financialization, and increased technological capacity of the system. Capitalism's source of profit, labor, was now being exploited by an apparatus too big to expand the profits of the system without intensified exploitation. The aftermath of capitalism's periodic collapses from overproduction and under consumption have been characterized ever since by a complete and total assault on all workers. 
‚ÄúWages have declined or remained stagnant for nearly four decades.‚Äù 
The conditions of the crisis speak for themselves. Workers in the US, and the entire Western world for that matter, have seen conditions rapidly deteriorate as the capitalist system has sought to maximize profits in the face of productive slowdown. Free trade agreements such as NAFTA have given corporations the freedom to eliminate production domestically in order to seek a better deal internationally. Wages have declined or remained stagnant for nearly four decades . Unemployment has become a permanent fixture of life for millions and nearly one of two people in the US are considered poor or ""near poor."" 
At this time, the US is a low-wage capitalist economy dominated by service oriented, precarious employment. Racism has played a large part in the disparity inherent under these conditions. The wealth gap between Black America and White America is larger than it was in the Civil rights era. Not only has Black America been the target of racist housing policies from predatory lenders leading up to the 2008 crisis, but the burden of privatization and austerity has been directly aimed at Black families. Hedge funds, for example, have used working class Black communities as the guinea pig to test the effectiveness of massive school closures and teacher layoffs as well as the expansion of charter schools. Thousands of Black teachers have lost their jobs as a result to the mostly white demographic of Teach for America corps members. 
‚Äú The wealth gap between Black America and White America is larger than it was in the Civil rights era.‚Äù 
However, it is not enough to understand the crisis of capitalism through an economic lens. The crisis possesses many forms. Repressive state activity has become more pronounced, especially in the aftermath of the War on Terror. Racist repression in particular has intensified as the vast majority of oppressed communities, particularly Black workers, have seen their labor become disposable in a post-industrial society. Nearly 1100 Black Americans are killed every year by law enforcement all over the country. The war on Black and indigenous peoples that laid the foundation of the United States has only become more severe, as evidenced by the fact that one of every eight prisoners in the world is a Black American. The Dakota Access Pipeline struggle has shown that not even the concentration camps forced upon indigenous people are safe from the profit-seeking tentacles of the crisis-ridden system. 
And every American can guarantee that civil liberties are a thing of the past. The NSA, FBI, and the rest of the intelligence community possess access to the entire population's mail and phone devices. A massive surveillance dragnet accountable to no one but the ruling class allows the US state to keep tabs on whoever resists the conditions of the crisis. War at home is ultimately a reflection of the broader war being waged around the world. The US capitalist system is a global system with the largest military state in human history. War has thus played a critical role in the response to system crisis. 
The US military acts as the enforcement arm of neo-colonialism and capitalist exploitation around the world. It has expanded into nearly every African state through the US African Command (AFRICOM). The US military state continues to support fascism in Ukraine and fundamentalist Islam in places like Saudi Arabia and Qatar. It has destabilized a number of nations in the last decade alone, including Iraq, Afghanistan, and Libya. The US has collaborated with NATO, Israel, and Turkey to militarily encircle Russia and China militarily and sponsor terror groups responsible for the massacres in Syria. 
‚ÄúThe US imperialist system is predicated on the expansion of global capital by any means at its disposal, including the use military force to clear the way for corporate plunder. 
But the US military is in crisis too. It is plagued by a disillusioned rank and file and the inevitability of a global confrontation with Russia and China if it continues on the current course. The demands of a stagnating global capitalist economy and the ever-increasing exploitation of masses of working people offer no potential for a reversal of fortune. The US imperialist system is predicated on the expansion of global capital by any means at its disposal, including the use military force to clear the way for corporate plunder. The US military state has grown both in size and in violence in order to prevent the global shift of power currently underway. 
Russia and China have become the number one challengers to US global hegemony. China's economy will soon surpass that of the US and Russia's recovery from post-Soviet collapse has propelled the Putin-led nation back onto the global scene as a major factor in world affairs. These two powers are becoming increasingly close both economically and militarily. This has made the US ruling class increasingly nervous in the midst of economic decline. To maintain hegemony, the US military state set the world ablaze through endless war in every region of the world that dares to seek ties with Russia and China. 
At this point, the US imperialist system cannot peacefully compete in any way with its so-called rivals to the East. The contradictions of the system have become unmanageable. Unemployment, poverty, racist state repression, and war are all the system has to offer. Another economic collapse is on the horizon. Crisis is built into the global capitalist system's constant drive to accumulate profit in the face of global misery. The decline of US imperialism and empire will not change regardless of the election. What is sure to change is the mass reaction to the decline as life becomes more and more unbearable under the grip of empire.

Margaret Flowers‚Äô Retrospective on Running as a Green for the U.S. Senate,"2016 elections by BAR editor and columnist Dr. Marsha Adebayo 
The major parties are more concerned with preserving their duopoly than with defeating each other. So-called ‚Äúprogressives‚Äù help preserve duopoly rule, failing ‚Äúto understand that as long as they are complicit with the Democrats, they have no power.‚Äù Most people are actually more Green than Democratic in their views, but ‚Äúhave a hard time comprehending that there are more than two parties,‚Äù according to Green candidate Dr. Flowers. Margaret Flowers‚Äô Retrospective on Running as a Green for the U.S. Senate by BAR editor and columnist Dr. Marsha Adebayo 
‚Äú The message of the Green Party resonates with people because we talk about real issues that they experience in their lives and solutions that they want to see.‚Äù 
The Democratic and Republican parties‚Äô attempt to monopolize the presidential media cycle was challenged by candidates like Dr. Margaret Flowers, who ran for the US Senate on the Green Party ticket in Maryland. She used the electoral platform to speak directly to working class communities. Dr Flowers was profiled in a recent BAR article regarding the decision of the Maryland League of Women Voters to deny her the right to participate in the only televised senatorial debate. Undaunted, Dr. Flowers took to the stage and demanded to be recognized as an equal participate in the electoral process. She was escorted off stage by security forces under protest with audience members shouting: ‚ÄúLet her speak!‚Äù 
Margaret is a Maryland pediatrician and mother of three. In 2007, she made the decision to stop practicing clinical medicine, which she viewed as antithetical to the welfare of working class and front line communities. Instead, she decided to ‚Äúpractice political medicine.‚Äù The class dynamics of health care is evident to her. ‚ÄúThe wealth divide is one of our biggest health care problems‚Äù and is the cause of ‚Äúthe greatest disparity‚Äù in health outcomes. In 2009, she joined Physicians for a National Health Program, becoming a Congressional Fellow and opening a chapter in Maryland. She was arrested at a Senate Roundtable on Health Insurance for speaking on behalf of the single payer option. Margaret said in an interview: ‚Äúour first goal was to have a seat at the table‚Ä¶.If we couldn‚Äôt get a seat, at least we could expose the insincerity of the current attempt at healthcare reform and show that single payer was actively being excluded.‚Äù 
Margaret views the struggle for health care as ‚Äúpart of a broader social, racial, economic and environmental justice movement.‚Äù She has organized campaigns to fight for state and federal single payer health care systems. In addition, Margaret provided leadership and took on corporations focusing on the issue of net neutrality, the concept that everyone should have equal access to the Internet regardless of their usage or ability to pay. 
I met Margaret during the Freedom Plaza Occupy Movement in Washington, DC where she helped me organize the Occupy EPA demonstrations. 
Below, Margaret provides her reflections and analysis on running as the 2016 Green Party candidate for the US Senate in Maryland. 
Adebayo: What political and cultural lessons did you learn from running against the Democratic and Republican machines? 
Flowers: Running for office in Maryland taught me that the major political party machines, especially the Democratic Party, are pervasive in our state. Their tentacles reach deep into the non-profit organizations, the media, the polling organizations and the universities. 
There is a culture in the state that is trapped in the duopoly. People are so used to thinking in terms of just Democrats and Republicans that they have a hard time comprehending that there are more than two parties. It is almost like a habit. When confronted with the reality that the media, non-profits, polls and universities were excluding our campaign, the most common responses were that this is how it has always been or that they excluded us because they could. 
It was disappointing that the Maryland League of Women Voters, which is supposed to be nonpartisan and educate voters about their choices on the ballot, imposed an arbitrary high polling criterion that was used to keep me out of debates. It was disappointing that a public university, the University of Baltimore, which sponsored the only televised senate debate in Maryland, shut down political discourse by excluding me even though I would have provided a perspective that was not heard in the debate. 
It was interesting to see how the media and polling organizations create a Catch-22 situation for alternative party candidates. Early on in my campaign, when public pressure was applied, the Baltimore Sun published one article on my campaign that mostly argued that I had no chance of winning and that I was mostly like a Democrat. Their failure to cover my campaign early on, or to even mention that I was running when they covered the other candidates, made it less likely that I would reach potential donors and volunteers. This made it less likely that I would poll well, especially since there were few polls that included me and they were done in September. As a result, my low polling numbers were used to justify my exclusion from events. 
When our campaign did reach people, we received a very welcoming response. People are interested in a broader discussion of the crises we are facing and solutions to them. The solutions that I support are widely supported by the public. 
And finally, it was interesting to see how so-called progressive organizations are trapped inside the Democratic Party and fail to understand that as long as they are complicit with the Democrats, they have no power. They fail to understand that their undying support for Democrats basically means that they are taken for granted. Unfortunately, ‚Äúprogressive‚Äù organizations endorsed Van Hollen and Clinton, even though their platforms include support for fracking and war and only partial solutions to the crises in education, healthcare and other human rights violations. This support and undying commitment of so-called ‚Äúprogressive‚Äù organizations to the Democratic Party defies logic. 
Adebayo: In your opinion, how can the Green Party use the momentum of your state campaign as well as the national Stein/Baraka campaign to create a more effective popular grass-roots movement? 
Flowers: It is already happening. New Green Party locals are forming around the state of Maryland. The current locals are growing. Many of the people who are involved in the locals are also involved in advocacy and activism, so there is a natural synergy. It is our task now to continue to nurture and grow that for the next election and to encourage greater collaboration and visibility of the Green Party with local movements. 
Personally, my next focus will be to stop the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP). We are organizing to stop it from being ratified by Congress after the election. If we stop that, it will be a huge victory of popular power over corporate power. We can build off that to encourage more people to rise up and demand that the political agenda protect people and the planet. 
Adebayo: How do third party organizations, such as the Green Party, fight the political, financial and media dominance of the two major corporate parties? 
Flowers: This is a David and Goliath fight, but we have truth and justice on our side. The message of the Green Party resonates with people because we talk about real issues that they experience in their lives and solutions that they want to see. We are working to expose the media blackout and to encourage people to demand that the media and debates are more inclusive. And we are learning to use social media platforms to reach people. One aspect of the campaign that is very heartening is the commitment of the volunteers. People are donating their skills in filmmaking and graphic design. People are doing regular outreach and visibility actions across the state. It is truly amazing and it energizes me to see it. 
Adebayo: As you reflect on your Senate campaign, what strategies worked best to encourage activism and what stratagems could you have employed to elicit more public support? 
Flowers: Running a statewide campaign is a challenge. Some of the best experiences that I had were doing one-on-one outreach around the state. I would definitely do more of that if I ran again. And holding volunteer training sessions is critical for people to develop comfort with outreach strategies. I am sure that there is more that I could do, but at this point I am still focused on completing this campaign. Then we will debrief more.

Black American Anti-Imperialism: an Invisible Subject for the New York Times,"Tweet Widget by Bryan K. Bullock 
To read the foreign policy pages of the New York Times is to enter a world of whiteness. ‚ÄúWhites are the only ones who are presumed to have an opinion on such issues that is worth mentioning.‚Äù Although Black America is the nation‚Äôs most anti-imperial constituency, foreign policy is considered a white preserve. Blacks ‚Äúserve the function we have always served: subjects of imperialism, scapegoats for repression, but not shapers of foreign policy.‚Äù Black American Anti-Imperialism: an Invisible Subject for the New York Times by Bryan K. Bullock 
‚ÄúFrom Vietnam through Iraq, African Americans have proved to be the group of Americans most opposed to U.S. military intervention.‚Äù 
The October 4, 2016, issue of the New York Times , which contained the article, ‚ÄúSyrian War Magnifies Tension in America‚Äôs Global Mission,‚Äù is a case study in white supremacy. The article is framed from a totally white ‚Äúconservative‚Äù and ‚Äúliberal‚Äù frame, and completely ignores the perspective of African Americans, who, traditionally, and today, are consistently and overwhelmingly, anti-imperialism and who tend to identify with other Black and Brown people across the globe, including the Palestinians and Syrians. 
The article purports to give ‚Äúboth sides‚Äù of the argument for U.S. intervention in the affairs of sovereign nations. The authors of the article give the impression that they are being ‚Äúbalanced‚Äù in giving the views of those who support America‚Äôs ‚Äúmission‚Äù in the world and those who are ‚Äúcritical‚Äù of said ‚Äúmission.‚Äù This false ‚Äúbalance‚Äù does not include the perspectives of any African American historians or critics of U.S. foreign policy, like Professor Gerald Horne, Bill Fletcher, Anthony Monteiro, Glen Ford or African (American) scholars like Horace Campbell. In fact, ‚Äúboth sides‚Äù of any debate in the U.S. regarding foreign policy, are both white ‚Äúsides.‚Äù This is particularly true when it comes to U.S. foreign policy, where whites are the only ones who are presumed to either have an opinion on such issues, or one that is worth mentioning. 
It is true that ‚Äúboth sides‚Äù could include Blacks who adhere to the Eurocentric, party-line views of the dominant U.S. narrators, say, Donna Brazile or Condoleezza Rice, or Blacks on the so-called ‚Äúleft,‚Äù but their views (still missing from this piece) are not a Black critique. It is a Eurocentric critique coming from a Black person, which is fundamentally different than an African American critique viewed through the lens of the African American experience. The ideas, views and critiques of Black thinkers are notoriously absent in the pages of the Times when it comes to foreign policy -- which proves that the writers, the editorial staff and the paper itself does not consider those views important. And in ignoring those critiques, it also ignores the historical critical analysis of the people who are and have been the subjects of U.S. foreign policy. 
‚ÄúThe ideas, views and critiques of Black thinkers are notoriously absent in the pages of the Times when it comes to foreign policy.‚Äù 
It also completely ignores the analysis of great Black historical thinkers like W.E.B. DuBois, Walter Rodney and Paul Robeson, Malcolm X, the late stage Martin Luther King, Jr., as well as the organizations they represented such as the Council on African Affairs (the CAA), the NAACP of the 1940‚Äôs, the African Liberation Support Committee, the Black Panther Party, The African Blood Brotherhood, the Organization of Afro-American Unity, Trans Africa, the U.S. Human Rights Network, the United Negro Improvement Association or the National Council of Black Lawyers, all of whom were deeply critical of America‚Äôs so-called mission in the world, especially as it related to African and Asian peoples, like Haitians, Congolese, Syrians, Yemenis and Palestinians. The critiques of these people are irrelevant to, not only the Times , but in truth, to the Democratic and Republican parties, the current incarnation of the NAACP, the Black Congressional Caucus, President Obama and most white liberal formations. However, this is not a reason to give the Times a pass. Even the use of the word ‚Äúmission,‚Äù with the European habit of sending missionaries into Africa and the Americas to soften the people up with European religion before they were subdued by hard power, does not elicit irony on the part of the Times . The ‚Äúwhite man‚Äôs burden‚Äù of ‚Äúcivilizing‚Äù the darker races of the world, through enslavement, destroying their religions, cultures, languages, colonizing their lands and resource and extracting their people and whisking them away to foreign lands to toil from birth to death for free, is just as important and essential a part of the history of ‚ÄúAmerica‚Äôs Global Mission‚Äù as anything else mentioned in the piece. 
The hand wringing of the mostly white imperialists on the ‚Äúleft‚Äù and on the right, regarding the proper way to engage in imperialism, is essentially what the piece presents. No other perspectives or voices are important or valid. Thus the perspectives of African American thinkers are only relevant in American discourse when it concerns ‚Äúblack‚Äù issues like police brutality, but not on international issues, although many black writers and thinkers would argue the two are connected. This is so even though the very presence people of African descent in America is a direct result of the United States‚Äô foreign policy of capturing, importing and enslaving African people. This point is lost on white foreign policy writers. However, early Black thinkers were clear on this point. People like DuBois and Robeson, in the past, and contemporaries like Glen Ford, were/are, fiercely anti-imperialist. 
‚ÄúThe perspectives of African American thinkers are only relevant in American discourse when it concerns ‚Äòblack‚Äô issues like police brutality, but not on international issues.‚Äù 
The white, imperialist presentation in the article excludes the ideas of Syrian Americans, Indigenous populations, Mexican and Puerto Rican Americans and Hawaiians, all of whom may have a totally different idea of America‚Äôs ‚Äúobligation‚Äù in Syria. Penny M. Von Eschen notes in the book, Race Against Empire, Black Americans and Anticolonialism 1937-1957 , that ‚ÄúObjecting to U.S. support for South African and the European colonial powers, and increasingly challenging the notion that America was the legitimate leader of the ‚Äòfree world‚Äô and therefore above censure, black Americans both criticized new directions in American foreign policy and attempted to use the United Nations as a forum in which to gain support for civil rights struggles in the United States.‚Äù African Americans are no less critical of America‚Äôs self-serving ‚Äúmission‚Äù today as was then. African Americans were highly critical of the U.S.‚Äôs violent overthrow of the African nation of Libya, its aggressions toward Cuba in the 60‚Äôs and Venezuela in the Chavez era and today. We have not forgotten America‚Äôs refusal to recognize Haiti as an independent Black nation when it defeated the French. Nor are we unmindful of the U.S. invasion of Haiti in 1915 and its support of dictators of the Duvalier family, the coup of the Aristide government and the fact that President Obama tried to prevent Aristide from returning to Haiti. 
Black thinkers on international issues are highly supportive of the Palestinian cause and troubled by the continued expansion of AFRICOM, the U.S. Africa Command, on the continent. This analysis is glaringly absent from mainstream media portrayals of America‚Äôs ‚Äúduty‚Äù in the world. The Times article offers the view that, ‚ÄúBecause many Americans see their foreign policy as a grand mission to make the world a better place, they tend to divide the world into heroes who support their ideals and villains who oppose them.‚Äù But which Americans are the writers talking about and whose ‚Äúideals‚Äù are represented in U.S. foreign policy. It is certain that the views of people like George Padmore, a leader in the Pan-African movement in the 40‚Äôs and 50‚Äôs, are not represented by this view. Padmore was clear that, ‚ÄúEmpire and peace are incompatible.‚Äù Michael C. Dawson notes, in Blacks in and Out of the Left : ‚Äúfrom Vietnam through Iraq, African Americans have proved to be the group of Americans most opposed to U.S. military intervention.‚Äù It is also purposely ‚Äúforgotten‚Äù that the Black Panther Party was, following in the footsteps of their ideological predecessor, Malcolm X, staunchly anti-imperialist. As Eldridge Cleaver noted, the U.S. was ‚Äúbankrolling and arming all of the oppressive regimes around the world.‚Äù One of the agenda items contained in the National Black Political Agenda, created in Gary, Indiana, in 1972 called for an end to the Vietnam War and the immediate withdrawal of foreign troops from Asia and Africa; the withdrawal of U.S. military, corporations, and communications facilities from southern Africa and the Third World; self-determination of Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands; an end to sanctions against Cuba and the closure of the American military base at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba. 
‚ÄúAfrican Americans were highly critical of the U.S.‚Äôs violent overthrow of the African nation of Libya, its aggressions toward Cuba in the 60‚Äôs and Venezuela in the Chavez era and today.‚Äù 
Contemporary white American analysis of U.S. foreign excludes the historical reality that, in thinking of America‚Äôs support of so-called rebels in Syria and Libya , it is clear to African Americans that America never supported a single African liberation group in Africa. It is not lost on Black Americans that the African National Congress and Nelson Mandela were considered terrorists by the U.S. No African rebel movement seeking independence from the Dutch, British, French, German, Portuguese or Italian colonizers of African lands ever received a single drop of military support from Washington. The U.S. never supported the Mau Mau in Kenya, nor Frelimo in Mozambique, nor the ANC in South Africa, or any other revolutionary movement on the continent. 
In fact, the contrary is true. From the coup against Kwame Nkrumah in Ghana to the assassination of Patrice Lumuumba in the Congo, to the capture of Nelson Mandela and to the support the racist apartheid system of South African and the murderous colonial regime in the former Rhodesia, the American government has consistently and forcefully opposed revolutionary movements in Africa and in fact supported their colonial oppressors. The only country to ever militarily support African liberation was Cuba, not the U.S. Regarding Mandela, (who the U.S. considered a terrorist) we heard him clearly when, in response to a request to condemn Fidel Castro, Yassar Arafat and Mommar Ghadifi, he said, your enemies are not necessarily our enemies. Indeed, not only did Castro send troops to aid the Angolans in defeating the South Africans, he also provided refuge for many African American freedom fighters, from Robert Williams to Assata Shakur. While the U.S. was infiltrating, surveilling and murdering Black political activists in the Black Panther Party, leaders of North Vietnam, China, Algeria and Cuba welcomed them as ambassadors of the African American community. 
‚ÄúIt is clear to African Americans that America never supported a single African liberation group.‚Äù 
Understanding this historical reality, Black thinkers are justifiably critical and suspicious of U.S. intentions in places like Iraq, Iran, Syria and Libya. The greatest thinkers in African American culture explicitly made the connection between the U.S. and European colonialism abroad, in places like Syria, as an extension of the domestic policy of treating African Americans as second class citizens ‚Äì or, as some African American thinkers have argued, the domestic colonization of Black people. The genocide of the Native Americans resonates with Black Americans. Leaders from MLK, who connected America‚Äôs imperialism in Vietnam, and the tax dollars used to support it, to the lack of financial resources available to be used to build cities and provide a basic wage; to Malcolm, who traveled the globe making personal connections with African heads of state, including Nasser in Egypt. It was Malcolm who saw the historic opportunity of the Bandung Conference, where 29 Asian and African, post-colonial nations, met to discuss their own fates independent of colonial powers, including the U.S. 
Black American support for anti-imperialist movements did not find a space in the Times‚Äô analysis of Syria. The writers and editorial staff at the Times are oblivious to the histories of the Third World peoples living in their midst. Therefore, for Black people who understand this history, they recognize articles like the one published in the Times as imperial propaganda pieces for global white supremacy. Yet, the Times , in that regard, is no different than any other white American newspaper, magazine or news program or politician. They all (even, or especially, the Black ones) present a Eurocentric worldview that excludes the ideas, histories and analysis of its black population. We are irrelevant. We serve the function we have always served: subjects of imperialism, scapegoats for repression, but not shapers of foreign policy. Blacks can nominally participate in the American experience, but only so long as we stay in our place and as long as we support the ‚Äúmanifest destiny‚Äù of the global hegemon and not get in its way. We are cannon fodder for the imperialist wars abroad and casualties in the U.S. war on drugs and on poor Black life at home. 
‚ÄúMalcolm traveled the globe making personal connections with African heads of state, including Nasser in Egypt.‚Äù 
The presence of a black face at the head of the empire has provided cover for U.S. imperialism in Africa and Asia, but it has not diminished the anti-imperialism of the black community. It has silenced the voices of the self-appointed black ‚Äúleaders‚Äù and revealed them to be supporters of empire and oppression. The Times , too, or rather again, reveals itself as a supporter of the Pentagon by publishing an article that is short on true analysis of America‚Äôs support of terrorists in Syria, as well as presenting a limited, white supremacist parameter of debate. Although the African American tradition of anti-imperialism may not be important to the Times , it is a tradition that is still alive nonetheless. And neither the Black face of the empire, nor the white press in service to it, can diminish it. Our antagonism against imperialism may not be publicized in the pages of the Times , but it lives on in our continued support for amnesty for Assata Shakur, the release of all political prisoners from Leonard Peltier to Jalil Muntiquim and Oscar Rivera Lopez, to support for Palestinian self-determination, to opposition to the re-colonization of Africa by America‚Äôs Africa Command, to the growing support by Black athletes, young and old, of Colin Kaepernick‚Äôs refusal to stand for the National Anthem, to our opposition to all U.S. wars of aggression, including the ones in Libya and Syria. African Americans‚Äô opposition to the U.S. supported aggression in Syria, masquerading as humanitarian support, is obviously irrelevant to the Times , but Malcolm X told us plainly years ago, that the media would have us thinking the good guy was the bad guy and vice versa. So whether, or even if, Assad is a ‚Äúruthless dictator,‚Äù the term the U.S. has used against everyone from Castro to Chavez, it does not therefore mean that African Americans agree that the U.S. has the right to support insurrection in Syria. We know imperialism is Euro-American, white, capitalist venture that is carried against ‚Äúthe darker nations,‚Äù not for them. Malcolm, Martin and Mandela taught us well. Attorney Bryan K.

Clinton Is the Most Dangerous Person Alive ‚Äì An Interview with Edward S. Herman,"2016 presidential campaign by Ann Garrison 
The just-concluded election revealed as much about the corporate media, which has broken every rule of journalism to support Hillary Clinton, and the fraudulence of much of the American Left, which turns out to have no real problem with war or capitalism, than it did about the candidates, themselves. Edward Herman is an exception, a genuine man of the Left. He says ‚Äúa vote for Hillary Clinton is a vote for war with Syria and Russia.‚Äù Clinton Is the Most Dangerous Person Alive ‚Äì An Interview with Edward S. Herman by Ann Garrison 
‚Äú The election of Hillary Clinton might threaten a democratic order as much as a Trump victory.‚Äù 
Ann Garrison: Earlier this year, you told me that you differ with Noam Chomsky, your co-author of Manufacturing Consent and other books, in that you plan to vote for the Green Party's presidential and vice presidential candidates Jill Stein and Ajamu Baraka in the swing state of Pennsylvania. Are you still planning to do so? 
Edward S. Herman: Yes. 
AG: Can you explain why? 
ESH: Because the two duopoly candidates are dangerous to societal and international welfare and even survival. Hillary Clinton is a neo-liberal and pre-eminent war-monger. I think she is the most dangerous person living in the world today, given her highly likely election victory and her likely performance as president. She represents the corporate elite and military-industrial complex more clearly than Trump and she is a follow-on to Bush and Obama. She will pursue similar policies except for her somewhat more aggressive bent. 
Trump is a self-promoting windbag, racist and dangerous, unpredictable phony. We have a ghastly choice in these two. Jill Stein offers a protest opportunity, more so than not voting. On the line that either voting for Stein or not voting would constitute a vote for Trump, one might argue that a vote for Hillary Clinton is a vote for war with Syria and Russia and a vote for Netanyahu (and hence for escalated violence in Palestine). 
AG: Hillary Clinton and John Podesta's e-mail has revealed that Hillary Clinton is well aware that the Saudi and Qatari rulers - not rogue elements - fund ISIS, and the same Saudi and Qatari rulers fund the Clinton Foundation. Throughout the last George Bush's presidency, there were innumerable headlines that ""Saudi oil sheikhs met with George Bush on his Crawford, Texas ranch."" What are your thoughts on that? 
ESH: Saudi Arabia is a US ally and an instrument of the warfare state. Hillary Clinton has treated its leaders warmly and she will continue to do so as president. The Clinton Foundation's receipt of money from Saudi and Qatari leaders is a first class conflict of interest and outrage, but the media have focused on the many less important abuses of Trump, helping cover over the outrages of their preferred candidate, Hillary Clinton, and her husband, Bill Clinton. 
AG: What do you think of Clinton's statement that she would make removing Bashar Al-Assad her top priority? And Trump's statement that he would not, because that would recklessly risk confrontation with Russia? 
ESH: Hillary Clinton has essentially promised to escalate war in Syria and is therefore promising to go to war with Russia as well. Diana Johnstone has made the case that Hillary Clinton plans to try to bring about ""regime change"" in Russia (cite). This is of course incredibly dangerous and would have aroused a really democratic media, but the existing media are part of the war system, hence Hillary Clinton's commitment to wars is essentially suppressed. Trump has made a number of statements along the lines of reducing US interventions and commitments abroad and trying to deal with Russia in a less confrontational manner, but he has sometimes contradicted himself by urging expanded arms, use of nuclear weapons, etc. But Hillary Clinton has said nothing that would offset her war-mongering. This difference from Trump may help explain the intensity of media hostility to Trump. 
AG: Jill Stein has said that ""wars for oil are blowing back at us wth a vengeance"" and that she would cut the military budget by half, close most of the foreign bases, and redirect resources into a Green New Deal that would fully employ Americans building sustainable energy and agricultural infrastructure. I can't imagine you disagree, but do you think it's important for the Greens to articulate such a vision at the national and international level, instead of focusing solely on local races that they might win? 
ESH: The Greens don't have the resources to compete in many local elections. So she is wise to focus on the big national and international issues. Furthermore, the real gap in the political system is the lack of opposition to national neoliberal and militaristic policies. It is said that she can't make a bigger mark given the hegemony of the duopoly, but even Ralph Nader couldn't get 5 percent of the vote. The system still works well, for the 1%. 
AG : Michael Moore has made a movie called ""Trumpland"" and warned that Trump's election would be the end of the United States , assuming that would be a bad thing. David Swanson, author of ""War Is a Lie,"" has imagined the same but argued, in "" Secession, Trump, and the Avoidability of Civil War ,"" that the break-up of the United States is not the worst possibility on the horizon. Do you have any thoughts on this? 
ESH: Michael Moore is completely oblivious to the fact that the enlarging war that is likely to follow Hillary Clinton's election threatens not only a nuclear exchange but also attacks on civil liberties and the march toward fascism. In its own way, the election of Hillary Clinton might threaten a democratic order as much as a Trump victory. The anti-Trump hysteria has tended to block out consideration of the Hillary Clinton menace. 
AG: Is there anything else you'd like to say about why you're voting for Jill Stein and Ajamu Baraka? 
ESH: I've always believed in the moral rule laid down in the categorical imperative: ""Do that which you would wish generalized."" Ann Garrison an independent journalist based in Oakland, USA.",1
"In Chicago, Teachers and Black Lives Matter Activists Partner to Build a Bigger Movement","Tweet Widget by Leah Fried 
When the Chicago Teachers Union goes on strike, it doesn‚Äôt walk alone; Movement 4 Black Lives organizations have their back. And, when young Black activists campaign against police terror, the teachers union is with them. When it comes to the school-to-prison pipeline, the teachers and Black Youth Project 100 are on the same side. In Chicago, Teachers and Black Lives Matter Activists Partner to Build a Bigger Movement by Leah Fried 
This article previously appeared in Labor Notes . 
‚ÄúTeachers joined protests led by Black Lives Matter and Black Youth Project 100, to disrupt the lucrative Christmas shopping season.‚Äù 
Extracting wins from the boss has never been easy‚Äîand union membership hovering at a low 11 percent isn‚Äôt making it any easier. But a good way to boost our numbers and power is to partner with people who are organized in other ways, building a broader movement as we build our unions. 
For several years the Chicago Teachers Union has put incredible effort into building unity‚Äînot only among its members, but also with parents and neighborhood groups. The results were on display in October as hundreds of volunteers worked daily in the lead-up to a possible strike. 
Parents spoke at press conferences, painted banners, handed out leaflets, distributed T-shirts and yard signs, and talked to other parents. My son‚Äôs elementary school was one of many where parents and kids joined teachers in an early-morning picket. 
One vehicle was the Chicago Teachers Solidarity Campaign, an alliance of dozens of unions and 60 community organizations‚Äîincluding the Chicago chapters of Black Lives Matter and Black Youth Project 100. 
Natural Allies 
Alliances take work, but they can be built on natural connections. ‚ÄúMany of us have either worked or been students in the Chicago Public Schools, or have partners who work for CPS,‚Äù said Aislinn Pulley, a leader in the Black Lives Matter chapter. 
That meant members already understood why public schools are worth fighting for. ‚ÄúA man named Ronald Johnson, who was killed by the police two years ago, had five children who are CPS students,‚Äù said Kofi Ademola, another chapter leader. ‚ÄúThey are in the care of their grandmother, who lives in poverty, and that family is directly impacted by the attacks on public education in our city. 
‚ÄúThe layoff of 1,000 teachers and plan to hire 1,000 more cops was a clear example of the divestment in our communities. They go hand in hand.‚Äù 
The understanding goes both ways. The teachers union has made racial segregation and school underfunding central issues in its contract campaigns. 
District administrators pay lip service to restorative justice, a disciplinary approach that looks for solutions instead of shunting kids into a school-to-prison pipeline. But it‚Äôs the union that has pushed for the funding required to make these programs work. 
CTU and a student group got a grant in 2013 to pilot restorative justice in four schools. In the new tentative agreement, the teachers have won funding to add restorative justice coordinators in 20 to 55 schools. 
In the run-up to the possible strike, the Black Lives Matter chapter spearheaded organizing a Freedom School to offer parents a safe place to send their kids while teachers were out on the picket lines. Chicago State University agreed to donate its space. Planned activities would include a youth town hall. 
The Same Values 
In August the Movement for Black Lives, an umbrella organization that includes Black Lives Matter and other groups, released a policy platform, workshopped with activists from its hundreds of member groups around the country. 
The platform declares the movement‚Äôs support for workers' right to organize unions. It calls for jobs programs, expanding labor laws to protect domestic workers, farm workers, and tipped workers, no Trans-Pacific Partnership, the renegotiation of anti-worker trade agreements, and the rewriting of tax codes so the wealthy pay their share. Unions have much in common with these values. 
Last November, after allegations emerged that the city had covered up video of a police officer killing African American teenager Laquan McDonald, CTU voted to support an elected police-accountability council in Chicago. Teachers joined the protests that followed, led by Black Lives Matter and Black Youth Project 100, to disrupt the lucrative Christmas shopping season. Marchers shut down the Magnificent Mile on Black Friday, chanting, ‚ÄúNo justice, no profit. 
That‚Äôs the kind of partnership Ademola would like to see more of: ‚ÄúHow do we amplify each other‚Äôs message and work together to target the oligarchs that fill the politicians‚Äô war chest?‚Äù",1
When Slaveholders Controlled the Government‚ÄîAn Interview with Matthew Karp,"Tweet Widget by Timothy Shenk 
In order to downgrade the centrality of slavery to the development of the United States and global capitalism, mainstream historians attempt to depict the slaveholding classes as provincial actors. However, the slave owners were the most powerful people in the country. ‚ÄúSoutherners imagined‚Äîand worked to build‚Äîan American republic whose foundation was slavery.‚Äù They wanted a strong United States, with a strong military, to protect slavery. When Slaveholders Controlled the Government ‚Äî An Interview with Matthew Karp 
by Timothy Shenk 
This article previously appeared in Dissent Magazine and Portside . 
‚ÄúIdeologically, slave labor fit in very well in a world increasingly dominated by free trade, expanding European empires, and hardening racist science.‚Äù 
Booked [1] is a monthly series of Q&As with authors by contributing editor Timothy Shenk. For this interview, he spoke with Matthew Karp about This Vast Southern Empire [2] (Harvard University Press, 2016). 
Between 1789 and 1850, the United States had twelve presidents. Ten of them owned slaves; the only two that didn‚Äôt were both named ‚ÄúJohn Adams.‚Äù The United States was a pioneering democracy, but its democracy was shaped by the demands of a slaveholding elite that had immense‚Äîand often decisive‚Äîauthority over its government. Princeton historian Matthew Karp explores the consequences of this arrangement in This Vast Southern Empire . He focuses on the influence Southerners wielded over foreign policy, but Karp‚Äôs inquiry opens up new perspectives on much more, including the dynamics of proslavery ideology, the world-making ambitions of Southern elites, and the origins of a Civil War that broke American democracy in two. It is a history driven by the intertwined forces of white supremacy, state power, and coerced labor‚Äîand it is a history that would persist long after the Confederacy‚Äôs demise. 
Timothy Shenk: When Americans talked about a ‚Äúvast Southern empire‚Äù before the Civil War, what did they have in mind? 
Matthew Karp: The short answer is that they weren‚Äôt talking about an independent Southern republic, but the entire United States. 
It‚Äôs easy to find sectionalism in Southern politics before the Civil War, but the most powerful antebellum Southerners‚Äîfrom Andrew Jackson to Jefferson Davis‚Äîwere nationalists, not separatists. What John C. Calhoun really wanted, as Richard Hofstadter wrote long ago, was not for Southerners to leave the Union but to dominate it, which they more or less did in the thirty years before the Civil War. 
Southerners imagined‚Äîand worked to build‚Äîan American republic whose foundation was slavery. In their minds, this was a powerful state, continental in scope and hemispheric in influence, which put the preservation of slaveholding property at the center of U.S. politics and U.S. foreign policy. That‚Äôs what they meant by ‚Äúthis vast Southern empire,‚Äù and that‚Äôs the focus of the book. 
Shenk: Especially in popular discussions, slaveholders are often seen as advocates of small government and states‚Äô rights. What does looking at the foreign policy visions promoted by leading proslavery figures do to that image? 
Karp: It‚Äôs true that in many antebellum political arguments, Southern leaders emphasized the limited powers of the federal government. But when slavery and states‚Äô rights came into conflict, the abstract commitment to limited government vanished pretty quickly. The outstanding example is the Fugitive Slave Act of 1850, which overrode personal liberty laws in the northern states and required federal marshals to assist slaveholders in capturing runaway slaves. 
You can look at this and say, ‚ÄúAha, they‚Äôre hypocrites!‚Äù But the use of federal power to defend slavery went far beyond hypocrisy‚Äîit was a cornerstone of antebellum Southern politics. Looking at U.S. foreign policy makes this especially clear. On many important questions of foreign relations‚Äîthe annexation of Texas, for instance‚Äîsupposed small-government ideologues suddenly morphed into bold advocates of federal power. Proslavery Southerners also served as by far the most aggressive champions of U.S. military and naval expansion. They didn‚Äôt do this because they were hypocrites, but because they believed the world‚Äôs strongest bulwark for slavery was not the weak state governments of the South, but the entire United States. 
Shenk: One of the most fascinating characters in this book, and in all of U.S. history, is John C. Calhoun. He was the most incisive thinker the plantation elite had‚ÄîRichard Hofstadter called him ‚Äúthe Marx of the master class‚Äù‚Äîand he‚Äôs a central figure in your account. What do we learn about Calhoun by bringing his foreign policy into the spotlight? 
Karp: We think of Calhoun as the quintessential antebellum Southern sectionalist. But from the perspective of foreign and military policy, he was much closer to a bold proslavery nationalist. As Secretary of State, he pushed aggressively for Texas annexation, bypassing Congress (and cutting constitutional corners) to offer military aid to Texas in 1844. Through the antebellum years he remained a relatively consistent advocate for army and navy expansion. 
Sometimes we imagine Southern slaveholders like Calhoun as isolated elites, barricaded in the parlors of their plantation homes. But Calhoun was also a bold proslavery internationalist . He paid close attention to the politics of slavery and abolition in Europe and in Latin America, and he was very assiduous about directing U.S. power to sustain slavery in Cuba and Brazil. For him, the international strength of slavery and the international strength of the United States were tightly bound together. 
Shenk: Recent historians have paid a lot of attention to the commercial relationships that bound the United States and the United Kingdom before the Civil War. As you note in the book, during this period ‚ÄúBritain was the world‚Äôs largest consumer of goods produced by American slaves.‚Äù But you also observe that this was the same period when the UK both abolished slavery and embarked on a renewed drive to establish a global empire. From the perspective of the American South, this combination seemed like a total jumble of ideological, cultural, and economic issues that the UK would have to sort out if they wanted to develop a coherent vision of their country‚Äôs place in the world. And it gets even more confusing when you remember that figures like Calhoun had spent most of 1812 pushing for a disastrous war with Britain. How did slavery‚Äôs defenders make sense of all this? 
Karp: Southern elites saw Britain as both a vital commercial partner and a potentially dangerous strategic enemy. That‚Äôs not necessarily incoherent, but it is confusing. It helps to approach Southern attitudes toward Britain from a chronological perspective. 
It‚Äôs hard to overstate the importance of the British abolition of slavery in 1833. Overnight, the policy of the world‚Äôs most powerful empire was now distinctly hostile toward one of America‚Äôs most fundamental institutions. In the early 1840s, Southern leaders in and around the administration of President John Tyler believed that defending slavery against British abolitionism should be a top strategic priority for the United States. There were many dimensions to this effort, from naval expansion to Cuba diplomacy, but in some sense it culminated with the U.S. annexation of the Republic of Texas, which was in 1845 the fourth largest slaveholding society in the world. 
By the 1850s, after the Texas annexation and the U.S.-Mexico war, the strategic situation had changed. Slaveholders were cheered by the apparent ‚Äúfailure‚Äù of emancipation in the West Indies‚Äîobviously, it wasn‚Äôt a failure for the emancipated slaves, but sugar production in Jamaica and elsewhere plummeted after abolition. Across the 1850s, slaveholding leaders eagerly reprinted evidence that Britain had soured on abolition, and was ready to accept the dominance of slave-produced staples (from the United States, Cuba, and Brazil) in the world market. This was a somewhat optimistic view, but by 1861, Southerners sincerely viewed Britain much more as a commercial partner than as a strategic rival. 
Shenk: For a long time, historians tended to think of the antebellum South as an almost feudal holdover from the past that could not stand up to the forces of modernity. In the last decade or so, however, scholars have become much more likely to depict it as thoroughly modern. Where does your research fall in that debate? 
Karp: You‚Äôre right about the tendency of the recent scholarship. In a lot of ways, my book is congruent with that work, although I do think there are limits to a social or economic interpretation of slavery that concentrates entirely on its modern characteristics. 
Really, though, the book is less about whether slavery was or was not ‚Äúmodern,‚Äù and more about the fact that leading slaveholders believed it was. I like what the historian Frederick Cooper says: scholars should stop ‚Äúshoehorning political discourse into modern, antimodern, or postmodern discourses‚Äù and instead ‚Äúlisten to what is being said in the world.‚Äù What slaveholders said, over and over again, was that ‚Äúmodern civilization‚Äù and African slavery were fundamentally compatible. Economically, they argued, slave labor was necessary to produce vital agricultural staples. And ideologically, slave labor fit in very well in a world increasingly dominated by free trade, expanding European empires, and hardening racist science. I think the most powerful slaveholding politicians‚ÄîCalhoun, Jefferson Davis, Alexander Stephens, and so on‚Äîbelieved this most of all. We have to understand that belief to understand antebellum politics. 
Shenk: By 1861, elite Southerners were no longer convinced the United States could serve as the agent of their interests, and so they break off to form the Confederacy. You argue that we should see the launching of the Confederate States of America as their ‚Äúboldest foreign policy project.‚Äù What do we gain by thinking of the Confederacy in this way? 
Karp: Slaveholding leaders didn‚Äôt want to abandon the Union. But their grip on the federal government was overthrown by the election of Abraham Lincoln and the Republican Party in 1860. Suddenly the power of the national state‚Äîwhich they had spent decades building up‚Äîcould be used to not to strengthen slavery, but to undermine it. 
All the same, I don‚Äôt think Southerners would have seceded without the confident belief that a slaveholding Confederacy could thrive on the world stage. In the book I look at two of the most famous Southern documents from early 1861‚Äîthe Mississippi declaration of secession [3] and Confederate Vice President Alexander Stephens‚Äôs ‚Äú cornerstone address [4].‚Äù Both are very candid about the central importance of slavery, and in contemporary discussions they are often brandished as clear evidence that slavery, not state rights, drove Southerners to secede (like the way Jon Stewart cites [5] the Mississippi declaration in this [5] episode of the Daily Show). 
That‚Äôs all true, but what‚Äôs most interesting about these documents is that they make a fundamentally international case for slavery. ‚ÄúOur position is thoroughly identified with the institution of slavery‚Äîthe greatest material interest of the world‚Äù: that‚Äôs the second sentence of the Mississippi declaration. It wasn‚Äôt just that slaveholders believed Britain and other European powers would come to their aid in a war against the North, although they did believe that. It was that their entire ideological and strategic worldview depended on a belief in the global necessity of slave labor. European states might oppose slavery in the abstract, but they could not escape the deeper principle of racial inequality upon which slavery rested. ‚ÄúThe truth of this principle may be slow in development,‚Äù Stephens admitted in his famous address, but so was the case with the controversial principles of Galileo or Adam Smith. Ultimately, he and other Confederate leaders were confident that the fundamental ideas of racial hierarchy and coerced labor would receive ‚Äúfull recognition . . . throughout the civilized and enlightened world.‚Äù That international confidence, I think, was a true ideological cornerstone of the Confederate project. 
Shenk: The book‚Äôs epigraph comes from Karl Marx‚Äî‚ÄúIn the foreign, as in the domestic policy of the United States, the interests of the slaveholders served as the guiding star‚Äù‚Äîand its footnotes are studded with classic works of Marxist scholarship, but your methodology here doesn‚Äôt follow the standard practice among Marxists. Your concern is with policymaking elites, and while you‚Äôre clearly aware that their work isn‚Äôt taking place in a vacuum, you‚Äôre not trying to write a history from the bottom up. Is there a contribution that you‚Äôre trying to make by shifting the angle of focus? 
Karp: Part of the issue here is that the literature on slavery and the Old South is, in some ways, the richest literature in U.S. history‚Äîthe crown jewel of American historiography, as I‚Äôve heard it described. And the best books on Southern politics, from the 1960s to the 2000s (many of them written from a Marxist or Marx-ish perspective), have been grounded very firmly in the social world of the antebellum South. 
I would say that my book‚Äôs focus on elite actors and elite sources should not be seen as a criticism of that literature, but an indirect appreciation of its richness. Historians are so accustomed‚Äîas we should be‚Äîto viewing slaveholders at the top of a complex pyramid of class, racial, and gender hierarchies in Southern society, that for a long time, we forgot that they were also the nation‚Äôs most powerful political leaders, and the world‚Äôs most powerful slaveholding class. Only in the past fifteen years or so have historians begun to look more systematically at slaveholders as leading national and international actors, as well as Southern social elites. Done right, I think, these approaches don‚Äôt contradict each other‚Äîthey complement each other. 
Shenk: You end the book by discussing a speech by that W.E.B. Du Bois gave at Harvard‚Äôs 1890 commencement, when he was twenty-two. In his address, Du Bois portrayed the Confederacy‚Äôs president Jefferson Davis as not just a successful politician but as the representative product of a whole civilization. Thirteen years after he made this argument, Du Bois wrote in The Souls of Black Folk , ‚Äúthe problem of the twentieth century is the problem of the color line.‚Äù Do you see a connection running from the history you examine here and the world that Du Bois saw at the turn of the twentieth century? 
Karp: Du Bois titled his 1890 address ‚Äú Jefferson Davis as a Representative of Civilization [6],‚Äù and by that he meant, provocatively, not just the civilization of the Old South, but all contemporary Western civilization itself. Davis‚Äôs life and career, according to Du Bois, prefigured the major world developments of the turn of the twentieth century‚Äîthe destruction of indigenous populations, the strengthening of a global color line, the extension of Euro-American empires over Asia, Africa, and Australia. It‚Äôs an incredibly powerful and ambitious speech for anyone to give, let alone a twenty-two year old undergraduate. 
Many historians would object to Du Bois‚Äôs intellectual genealogy here. Davis‚Äôs side, after all, lost the Civil War: the Confederacy was destroyed and slavery was abolished. The leading players in the world of 1890‚Äîfrom industrial tycoons from to European imperialists‚Äîseemingly owed little to Jefferson Davis or the slave South. U.S. President Benjamin Harrison was himself a Union Army veteran, who had marched with General Sherman into Georgia. 
But what I like about Du Bois‚Äôs speech is that he refuses, unlike so many later writers, to consign Davis to a distant and departed past, entirely walled off from the twentieth-century future. Davis and other slaveholding elites thought and acted as power players in a rapidly modernizing world. Their battlefield defeat should not blind us to the ways in which many of their core ideas‚Äîabout racial hierarchy, coerced labor, and imperial state power‚Äîsurvived long after 1865. 
That doesn‚Äôt mean that the Civil War, Confederate defeat, and slave emancipation were irrelevant. If anything, it underlines their significance. The larger point, though, is that when we look back at Davis and his ilk, we should not regard them as antiquarian curiosities, but as ambitious contenders for power in an uncertain mid-nineteenth century world. 
Shenk: Historians know you as a specialist in the antebellum South, but in the wider world you‚Äôre better known for your writings on contemporary politics, especially for your essays in Jacobin , which were some of the sharpest analyses of the Bernie Sanders campaign in this entire election cycle. On the surface, at least, those two don‚Äôt seem to have a lot in common. Do you see any common threads running through the two? What was it like wrapping up this book while also spending so much time with your feet planted in 2016? 
Karp: I‚Äôm not sure they do have much in common! I turned in my final draft of the book in January, just as the Democratic primary really got underway and Sanders emerged as a surprising contender for the nomination. It was fortunate timing, because after working on the book for years, I now had some free time to get involved in contemporary politics. 
To the extent that there is a connection between these things, it might have to do with my sense of slaveholders as a nineteenth-century ruling class. Our most powerful elites today are very different, and I don‚Äôt want to make a serious analogy between the two. But in the very general sense that slaveholders were a small and self-conscious class, nationally powerful, internationally sophisticated, and totally confident in the future of their system‚Äîdespite various warning signs all around the globe‚Äîtheir outlook is, in some ways, comparable to the outlook of today‚Äôs big capitalist class. And control of the American national state was‚Äîas it remains today‚Äîabsolutely fundamental to the operation of ruling class power. 
I agree with other historians and commentators, like Manisha Sinha [7] and Chris Hayes [8], that the contemporary left could stand to learn from the anti-slavery movement. The key, though, is not only to isolate and weaken the gun lobby or fossil fuel industry, for instance, but to develop a popular and more comprehensive critique [9] of the political-economic system‚Äîa twenty-first century version of the ‚ÄúSlave Power‚Äù argument. Slaveholders, after all, didn‚Äôt just represent a sector of the economy; they controlled the government. For all its weaknesses, I do think the Sanders campaign represented a major step forward in this larger project, and I‚Äôm probably unreasonably optimistic about the possibilities going forward.

The Deteriorating Situation in Ethiopia,"Tweet Widget by Yohannes Woldemariam 
The minority ethnic regime in Ethiopia now faces multiple rebellions. The regime‚Äôs foreign friends are part of the problem. ‚ÄúFaced with increased intrusion into their lands by so-called international investors, by displacement and by the breakdown of their social fabric, Ethiopians are mobilizing to resist.‚Äù The once formidable government coalition ‚Äúis beginning to unravel.‚Äù The Deteriorating Situation in Ethiopia by Yohannes Woldemariam 
This article previously appeared in Pambazuka News . 
‚Äú The revolts are widespread and they appear beyond the power of the state to control and put down.‚Äù 
The revolts in Ethiopia have the potential for creating radical, beneficial changes in the political order or instigating complete chaos that crosses its borders and destabilizes the entire fragile Horn of Africa region, for the outcomes of such uprisings have varied considerably from country to country. These protests can be the catalyst for building a new and democratic Ethiopia or end up in tears and disillusionment, as in Libya, South Sudan and many other places in the world. Countries emerging from dictatorships are particularly vulnerable and Ethiopia is certainly under a vicious dictatorship. 
The events in Ethiopia are being described as ‚ÄúIntifada,‚Äù ‚ÄúEthiopian Spring‚Äù or as something akin to the Color Revolutions in the Ukraine and Georgia and the 1989 Tiananmen Square protests in China. During the uprising in 2005 protesting the rigged election, the late chief of the Tigrean Peoples‚Äô Liberation Front (TPLF) and Prime Minister, Meles Zenawi, did say that there would not be any more Color Revolutions in Ethiopia. That uprising was put down with hundreds dead and thousands in concentration camps. 
This time, however, the revolts are widespread and they appear beyond the power of the state to control and put down. Apparently, Mr. Zenawi spoke prematurely. Technological innovation is a very important part of this current political mass mobilization, which is why the government has moved with cutting Ethiopia off from the internet and dismantling satellite dishes from the homes of ordinary citizens. Drawing on satellite television, mobile phones and the Internet, the revolts are spreading. Within seconds, activists send their messages against the tyranny. Unsurprisingly, the TPLF oligarchy is extremely fearful of social media websites like Facebook, Twitter and the diaspora media. 
In this piece, I want to reflect on three points: 
1. The celebrity factor: Feyisa Lilesa versus Prime Minister Halemariam Desalegn 
2. Mr. Abay Tsehaye‚Äôs reference to Rwanda 
3. The newly declared State of Emergency 
The celebrity factor: Feyisa Lilesa versus Prime Minister Halemariam Desalegn 
In the wake of the Rio Olympics, the profile of the Ethiopian uprising got a boost from Feyisa Lilesa , with his heroic act of crossing his arms on winning the silver medal for marathon, a signature symbol of solidarity of the oppressed Oromo nation to which Feyisa belongs. The influence of the celebrity athlete for social change is formidable, and Feyisa has emerged as a powerful voice for the struggle of his Oromo people, causing nervous shivers in the beleaguered regime. What the death and imprisonment of thousands of Oromos couldn‚Äôt accomplish in Ethiopia was achieved by his symbolic act at the finish line. Now the whole world is clued into the terrible conditions in Ethiopia and beginning to learn about the plight of the Oromo people. 
Other Ethiopian athletes have since used their successes to follow suit. Ebsa Ejigu, Tamiru Demissie and Hirut Guangul have used their international successes to publicize the plight of their country‚Äôs men and women to an international audience. This trend is likely to continue now as other athletes and celebrities are losing their fear of retaliation and becoming more and more willing to participate in what has become a growing national movement. Yes, these athletes will pay a price. Lilesa is now separated from his wife and children and beckoning an unknown fate. Life in exile will not be easy even for famous athletes. But compared to those losing lives and limbs to bullets in Ethiopia, it is a small price to pay. They are heroes, and their names are already inscribed in history books. 
‚ÄúThese athletes will pay a price.‚Äù 
The TPLF reaction to Lilesa‚Äôs heroic act can be gleaned from statements given by PM Hailemariam Desalegn. Although the PM is from the Wolayta ethnic group, which was traditionally relegated to the periphery of the Ethiopian mainstream, he has become a willing accomplice and spokesman for the TPLF. Most people regard him as an accidental PM who happened to be in the right place and at the right time when his powerful boss, PM Meles Zenawi, passed away in the summer of 2012. He was handpicked as Zenawi‚Äôs deputy because he wasn‚Äôt a threat and, as a non-Tigrean, served as a convenient cover and a token representing ‚Äúdiversity‚Äù for the TPLF. He is so loyal to the late PM, he still refers to the Meles ‚Äúvision‚Äù in his public pronouncements. Most Ethiopians know that he is just a figurehead with no real power. Yet, in an interview conducted with the online Foreign Policy.com, he is quoted as saying: 
‚ÄúIt‚Äôs me who sent [Lilesa] to Rio for the Olympics, and we expected him to come back after winning the medal. . . . [T]his is not the capacity of the man himself. It‚Äôs something which has been orchestrated by someone else from outside.‚Äù 
It is remarkable that the PM has the audacity to say he sent Feyisa Lilesa to the Olympics, as if Feyisa needed his charitable permission. It is crystal clear that Feyisa earned his place in the Olympics. 
One can readily concede that he may have acquiesced to nepotism by sending to the Olympics the unqualified son of the head of the sports federation, Robel Kiros Habte , who made Ethiopia a laughing stock with his hopeless performance in a swimming race. But no one can doubt that Feyisa went to the Olympics because he was Ethiopia‚Äôs best hope for the marathon. And he delivered in no unmistakable terms by winning a silver medal competing with the best and the elites in the world. It is hard to believe that Desalegn referring to Feyisa actually said: ‚ÄúThis is not the capacity of the man himself‚Äù ‚Äì thus exposing his own pomposity, shallowness and contempt for the Oromo hero. Clearly, Desalegn has sold his soul to the TPLF devil. To suggest that Feyisa cannot think for himself and act on his own is inexcusably ignorant and arrogant and unbecoming of a prime minster. 
‚ÄúDesalegn is a sellout with little dignity, reading and parroting whatever script is given to him by the TPLF.‚Äù 
Feyisa is not only a fine athlete; he is also a dignified, proud, principled and articulate Oromo and Ethiopian, as he amply demonstrated during the press conference in the Washington D.C. rally where Congressman Chris Smith also spoke. Also, in a direct reply to the PM‚Äôs insult, Feyisa quipped: 
‚ÄúI was not surprised by his comments because individuals who are always controlled by others tend to assume everyone is that way as well. . . . Unlike the prime minister, I make my own decisions and speak for myself.‚Äù 
Indeed, Desalegn is a sellout with little dignity, reading and parroting whatever script is given to him by the TPLF. The pretentious PM has replaced the real world with a make-believe virtual world. It is for this reason that he is unable to see realities on the ground; he is temporarily sheltered behind a wall whose mortar is sychophantic servitude and a wicked willingness to say and do anything to appease his TPLF benefactors. 
It is beyond regrettable that Desalegn is unable to see the rapid downside toward further chaos and civil war in Ethiopia that is due to the abject misery and oppression suffered by the people who are subjected to the policies of those he is serving and to whom he has sold his soul. He calls himself a born-again Christian with a straight face. How would Jesus himself, who stood up to the hypocritical Pharisees and threw the money-changers out of the temple in Jerusalem, have regarded a man like Desalegn, who is in bed with the TPLF elites who are the modern day equivalent of the Pharisees in Ethiopia and whose words and actions rarely match? The human suffering that is the result of the violent and continuous repression cannot be seen from inside their ideological castles resting on the thin air of empty rhetoric and shameless self-promotion. 
Desalegn would be well advised to keep his mouth closed to spare himself more disgrace. He has already sunk into the deep end of an abyss. It is depressing to see a human being selling out his people and becoming a slave of oppressors. 
Invoking the specter of Rwanda 
The TPLF ideologue and one of the real powers behind the throne, Mr. Abay Tsehaye, in an interview with the pro-government Radio Fana, compared the situation of Rwanda in the early 90s to the current situation in Ethiopia. He correctly stated that Rwanda was comprised of only two ethnic groups (the Hutu and the Tutsi), really not much of a country, and was on the verge of disintegration. He went on to say that reconciliation occurred and the country recovered. In Ethiopia with over eighty ethnic groups, if the situation goes ‚Äúout of control,‚Äù he concluded, Ethiopia will cease to exist as a country. Every thoughtful person worries about this. However, one can reasonably surmise from his analysis that Ethiopia under the control of his Tigray-dominated government, who make up only six percent of the Ethiopian population, is his guarantee for holding the country together. Mr. Tsehaye fails to recognize the draconian hegemonic policies of his regime as the very reasons for the grim state of affairs in the country. As the Ethiopian uprising makes clear, the various ethnicities are no longer buying TPLF shenanigans and see the TPLF itself as the main cause of Ethiopia‚Äôs predicament, as the country descends into possible civil war. 
For anyone willing to see the truth, Ethiopia is in a state of turmoil due to the exploitation of the long-suffering people of Oromia, Ogaden, Gambella and other ethnic groups by the TPLF elite in partnership with international enablers such as China and the United States, the principal rivals in Africa and the Horn region. The TPLF exploitation, in which valuable resources and political roles are dominated by a minority elite that has transformed itself into an oligarchy, has created highly rebellious resentment by the victims while reinforcing a sense of ethnic identity and consciousness. Faced with increased intrusion into their lands by so-called international investors, by the displacement and stunted developments they experience and by the breakdown of their social fabric, Ethiopians are mobilizing to resist. 
‚ÄúThe various see the TPLF itself as the main cause of Ethiopia‚Äôs predicament, as the country descends into possible civil war.‚Äù 
The government‚Äôs state-driven development projects financed by international investors and partners bypass the rural peasants and pastoralists, alienating the people and reinforcing the politics of deep ethnic hierarchy. Recent events have made it clear that TPLF‚Äôs ‚Äúconstitutional federalism‚Äù has more to do with its divide-and-rule strategy and its elitist allocation of national resources, comparable to actions of the former Soviet Communist Party, which retained tight control over its regions through local parties. The TPLF set up People‚Äôs Democratic Organizations, local versions of the ruling party, which squeezed out traditional authority. 
The co-opted ethnic leaders from these regions have either completely lost credibility, are sitting on the fence, or are jumping ship to support the resistance. Key former government figures like Junedin Sado are breaking their silence and speaking out with scathing attacks on the regime. He has apologized to the Ethiopian people for the time that he served under the regime. The so- called coalition that the TPLF built is beginning to unravel. Some Amhara and some Oromo are coming together against the TPLF, overcoming but not necessarily forgetting, the legacy of the historic oppression by Amhara elites which began with Menelik II. 
Abay Tsehaye and TPLF leaders will need to face reality ‚Äî if they have it in them to be truly concerned about Ethiopian unity. Oromo historical grievances are not myths, as some revisionist history asserts. Oromo land is the most fertile and lush in Ethiopia, in contrast to the northern Ethiopian highlands with its rugged mountains and thin soils contributing relatively little to national economic production, but the Oromo have been alienated from control over their land throughout the 20th century first by the Amhara and now by the new TPLF overlords. 
Acutely divided societies in which no single faction can impose its view might find an ability to arrive at political compromises in a constitutional form. But in Ethiopia, the hegemonic Amhara and now the Tigreans have excluded others from real power-sharing making true constitutionalism elusive. The leaders see the state as a prize to be won, a basis for private accumulation and patronage. But there is not enough patronage to go around, and those excluded from it mobilize their co-religionists and ethnic groups in an increasingly unmanageable opposition. 
The State of Emergency 
In response, the TPLF is relying on intensified repression by security forces, ethnic loyalists and the army. And for the first time in twenty-five years, the regime has declared a State of Emergency , clearly showing how rattled it is by the rebellion in the country. The Prime Minster announced : 
‚ÄúThe cause of this (state of emergency) is that anti-peace forces in collaboration with foreign enemies of the country are making organized attempts to destabilize our country, to disrupt its peace and also to undermine the existence and security of its peoples.‚Äù 
This response undoubtedly means more sticks and further erosion of civil liberties in the country but is unlikely to quell the unrest. One of the targets of the State of Emergency is the Internet and Social Media. PM Desalegn did make it a point to rant against diaspora media and the Internet during his appearance in September at the United Nations General Assembly: 
‚ÄúIn fact, we are seeing how misinformation could easily go viral via social media and mislead many people, especially the youth‚Ä¶Social media has certainly empowered populists and other extremists to exploit people‚Äôs genuine concerns and spread their message of hate and bigotry without any inhibition...it is critical to underline one matter which is usually given short shrift, both by the media and others. It is simply hypocritical to deny that some of our countries have been targets for destabilization activities carried out with no accountability by people and groups who have been given shelters by States with whom we have absolutely no problems.‚Äù 
The regime that Desalegn serves is responsible for suffocating the Ethiopian people by denying them any alternative media. The Ethiopian government is one of the top jailers and harassers of anyone daring to publish or practice independent journalism within the country. Now, Desalegn is shedding his crocodile tears about his inability to control and suppress social media and broadcasting emanating from the diaspora. While he has a point about the inherent potential for the abuse of social media, the regime is responsible for bringing criticisms on itself. In the absence of media freedom in the country, social media and broadcasting from the diaspora acquired enormous significance for Ethiopians hungry for information. It is clear that Ethiopians no longer trust the regime and have little confidence in official government news, which in reality is mostly propaganda. 
‚ÄúThe Ethiopian government is one of the top jailers and harassers of anyone daring to publish or practice independent journalism.‚Äù 
Authoritarian regimes adopt various forms of censorship to depoliticize the population and prevent the questioning of their legitimacy. By definition, authoritarian regimes demand strict submission by the media to their political authority. They do so by publishing or broadcasting deceptions in order to maintain their power structures. For example, the regime‚Äôs media censored Feyisa‚Äôs symbolic gesture in Rio while proclaiming that Feyisa is a national hero and welcome to return home, without any consequences. 
The advent of the Internet has somewhat leveled the playing field by empowering regular Internet users to become content producers by utilizing decentralized and distributed networks such as social media. These uses of media pose a great danger to dictatorial regimes, which are moving to subvert, block social media and limit internet use, as in Ethiopia today. 
China is the leading culprit in creating the technology to enable censorship, which it is sharing with the Ethiopian government. This suppression of the media will not succeed. Freedom-loving people find ways to circumvent these barriers and make determined efforts to stay informed ‚Äì and, in turn, to inform the whole world. Yohannes Woldemariam is an educator and author.

"America Might Not Deserve Trump, But Dems and Hillary Deserved To Lose","Tweet Widget by BAR managing editor Bruce A. Dixon 
President Donald Trump? How did such a thing happen? A competent and purposeful Clinton campaign should have beaten Donald Trump. How did Hillary Clinton and one-percenter Democrats snatch defeat from the jaws of certain victory? America Might Not Deserve Trump, But Dems and Hillary Deserved To Lose by BAR managing editor Bruce A. Dixon 
It‚Äôs over. The crotch-grabbing racist con man beat the lying corporate warmonger. Donald Trump is president-elect of the US. 
It didn‚Äôt have to happen that way. Trump‚Äôs winning 58 million votes were a hair fewer than Clinton‚Äôs popular vote, a million or two less than Republican losers McCain in 2008 and Romney in 2012, six and ten million behind Obama‚Äôs 2012 and 2008 numbers. The buffoonish Trump was elected with such a low turnout because Hillary Clinton‚Äôs campaign was even less competent and credible. To borrow the condescending language Barack Obama deploys before black audiences, Hillary‚Äôs campaign never gave Cousin Pookie much reason to get up off the couch and vote. 
Republican and Democratic parties are alike owned by their one-percenter investor/contributors. Democratic party shot callers decided they‚Äôd risk losing with Hillary Clinton rather than winning with Bernie Sanders. So Democratic party leadership, their media allies and the entire black political class got behind Hillary Clinton and helped collude and conspire to eliminate VT Senator Bernie Sanders, the Democrat with the best chance against any Republican opponent. 
Once Bernie Sanders was eliminated Hillary waged a lazy and ineffective campaign, playing a hand with just three cards. 
The first was the broken record of how unthinkable and unprecedented a disaster a Trump presidency would be‚Ä¶ a clownish sexual predator who pronounced climate change a hoax and would criminalize abortion, open concentration camps, repeal Obamacare, legalize stop and frisk, build a wall, appoint neanderthals to the Supreme Court, deport six or ten million immigrants instead of Obama‚Äôs paltry two million and who might be in hock to the Russians. Except for the thing about the Russians, it‚Äôs roughly the same picture Democrats have drawn of every Republican presidential candidate since Nixon. A story told that many times just gets old. Party leaders counted on it anyway, and it wasn‚Äôt enough. That was incompetence. 
A second and relatively weak card Democrats played was conjuring up an Imaginary Hillary Clinton, a defender of womens‚Äô and human rights who held hands with the moms of killer cop victims, and occasionally mumbled about black lives mattering and the need to reform the criminal justice system. But Hillary‚Äôs decades-long record as a tool of banksters, billionaires and one-percenters was so well established in the public mind that Imaginary Hillary was a difficult sell, not credible. 
The one-percenter Democrats‚Äô third card, on which they staked a lot was the early and unconditional endorsement of Hillary Clinton by   and Michelle. This had proven effective in Chicago in 2011 and 2015 where Obama‚Äôs blessings in 2011 and 2015 were key to fastening Rahm Emanuel on the city‚Äôs jugular vein after a half century of Daley rule. The entire black political class got behind Hillary too, from civil rights icons who ruminated on how they hadn‚Äôt seen Bernie Sanders back in the day to some other wise heads who assured us a vote for the Green Party‚Äôs Jill Stein and Ajamu Baraka was an act of ‚Äú narcissism ‚Äù or maybe white privilege . But at the end of  ‚Äôs time in office, the Obama endorsement didn‚Äôt carry the clout it used to. 
Thanks to two generations of lazy Democrats who refused to try to consolidate the victory of the 1965 Voting Rights Act the Supreme Court in 2013 nullified its key provisions, enabling a constellation of laws and practices aimed at limiting access to the ballot on the part of students, minorities, the elderly and constituencies likely to vote Democratic. In the 2016 election cycle these practices stripped another few million Democratic voters from the rolls. 
All in all, Democrats were the authors of their own defeat this presidential election. Hillary couldn‚Äôt campaign against the one percent because her party is a party of the one percent. Hillary Democrats including Bernie himself after the convention could no longer acknowledge joblessness, low wages, lack of housing, permanent war or the high cost of medical care or they‚Äôd be campaigning against themselves. 
Donald Trump didn‚Äôt win because of some mysterious upsurge of racism and nativism. He won because Hillary Clinton‚Äôs campaign was even less inspiring and less competent than his own, and worked hard to snatch its own defeat from the jaws of victory. America might not deserve President Donald Trump. But Hillary Clinton didn‚Äôt deserve to win, Bruce Dixon is managing editor at Black Agenda Report and co-chair of the GA Green Party.

The Democratic Debacle ‚Äì The Day After,"2016 presidential campaign by BAR executive editor Glen Ford 
The GOP won at the polls, but Black, brown and working class Democrats have been taking a beating from their own party for decades. ‚ÄúThe Democratic Party has failed to deliver even small net increments of social justice to its base constituencies, always giving away more than it gained, and at times taking the lead in savaging the people.‚Äù Hillary Clinton hoped to lead a Government of Ruling Class Consensus ‚Äì a victory only for the One Percent. The Democratic Debacle ‚Äì The Day After by BAR executive editor Glen Ford 
‚ÄúThe net economic loss to the people -- especially the masses of Black folks, who have been stripped of much of the gains of the Sixties and Seventies, and nearly all of their household wealth ‚Äì has been staggering and unrelenting.‚Äù 
The White Nationalists won and Hillary Clinton‚Äôs Big Tent, the bastion of the ruling class that Blacks and browns were led to believe was their sanctuary, has ignominiously folded. The media echo chamber smothered the deep, rumbling sounds of the impending quake, allowing only the corporate consensus to be heard outside the precincts of the Deplorables. But Deplorables want good jobs, too, and a future secure from the predations of Mad Capital, if only for their own ‚Äúkind.‚Äù Whites in the ‚ÄúRust Belt‚Äù joined with Confederates to choose their own brand of ‚Äúlesser evil‚Äù ‚Äì evils being the only items on the duopoly menu. 
Social democrats ‚Äì a broad group that includes the vast bulk of Black America, according to political scientist Michael Dawson -- huddled around the latrine of Hillary‚Äôs Big Tent, trying desperately to perfume the stench. Except for a few percentage points worth of Green voters, they opted, once again, for a fraudulent ‚Äúincrementalism‚Äù ‚Äì a foolishness dressed up as ‚Äúpragmatism‚Äù and even masquerading as high ‚Äústrategy‚Äù -- which has led ‚Äúprogressives‚Äù straight down a road to disaster in the neoliberal era. (My excessive use of quotation marks is intended to convey that even the language of much leftish discourse is crafted for the purpose of surrender to Power.) 
‚ÄúWhites in the ‚ÄòRust Belt‚Äô joined with Confederates to choose their own brand of ‚Äòlesser evil‚Äô ‚Äì evils being the only items on the duopoly menu.‚Äù 
Rather than gradually strengthening the political hand of the working and oppressed classes, bit by bit, year by year -- which is the purported justification for incrementalism -- progressive slavishness to the Democratic Party has facilitated the deepening dictatorship of capital. The net economic loss to the people -- especially the masses of Black folks, who have been stripped of much of the gains of the Sixties and Seventies, and nearly all of their household wealth ‚Äì has been staggering and unrelenting. 
For the past 40 years and more, Democrats have been perfect partners in the Dance of the Duopolists. It‚Äôs a simple two-step. The basic move is: the Democrats hug as closely as possible to the left flank of the Republican Party, thus staying within dog-whistle range of the White Man‚Äôs Party‚Äôs core base, rooted in white supremacy, while claiming everything to the left of Robert E. Lee as Democratic turf, including the huge, heavily Black social democratic electorate whose progressive agenda the Democrats have no intention of substantively addressing. 
The Clintons turned this two-step into a disciplined tango with their GOP partners. In 1994, the Republicans threatened to launch a social justice Armageddon through their Contract with America -- legislation they were incapable of fully enacting, however, without some level of Democratic consent. The Clintons vowed to defend Black, brown and poor people from the GOP barbarians at the gate ‚Äì and wound up ramming through Congress corporate-crafted measures that the Republicans could not have passed on their own. Bill and Hillary cut a rug to that tune for eight years in the White House, stomping out welfare as we knew it, eviscerating Franklin Roosevelt‚Äôs New Deal banking regulations, presiding over the largest surge in mass Black incarceration in modern history, and delivering the broadcast spectrum to monopoly media, all the while pretending to defend a ‚Äúprogressive agenda.‚Äù 
‚ÄúIslamic jihadists were enlisted en mass as U.S. imperialism‚Äôs hellish foreign legion in the Muslim world.‚Äù 
On the foreign policy side, the Clintons pioneered Washington‚Äôs ‚Äúhumanitarian‚Äù military intervention doctrine, later refined by Barack Obama and his secretary of state, Hillary Clinton. In the Democratic Republic of Congo, Bill Clinton set in motion the worst genocide since World War Two, a holocaust that has killed at least six million people under three US. administrations, and still counting. Humanitarian intervention, or Responsibility to Protect (R2P), became Obama‚Äôs favored instrument of aggression, a more domestically palatable alternative to George Bush‚Äôs massive boots-on-the-ground fiasco in Iraq. Islamic jihadists were enlisted en mass as U.S. imperialism‚Äôs hellish foreign legion in the Muslim world. Together, ‚ÄúNew‚Äù Democrats Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton turned Syria and Libya into maelstroms of slaughter and moved towards nuclear war with Russia. 
Obama‚Äôs domestic aggressions on behalf of Big Capital were equally bold. With both houses of Congress in Democratic hands and the GOP on the ropes in 2009, he rushed to put Social Security, Medicare and ‚Äúall entitlements‚Äù ‚Äúon the table‚Äù for cutting. Now dancing by himself, not even bothering to triangulate in the Clinton style, Obama tried to forge a ‚ÄúGrand Bargain‚Äù with the GOP by pulverizing the remnants of the social safety net. Only the Republicans' institutional imperative to defeat, rather than collaborate with,   -- its white supremacist DNA -- prevented consummation of the Grand Bargain, Obama‚Äôs Holy Grail. 
From Jimmy Carter to Barack Obama, the Democratic Party has failed to deliver even small net increments of social justice to its base constituencies, always giving away more than it gained, and at times taking the lead in savaging the people. There is no historical basis in the neoliberal era for the claim that the Democratic Party provides net incremental benefits to Black and working people, or that the party can be seized from its corporate masters and transformed into a machine that fights for the people. It fights for Capital ‚Äì tooth and nail, as Bernie Sanders‚Äô followers discovered. 
‚ÄúThe First Black President rushed to put Social Security, Medicare and ‚Äòall entitlements‚Äô ‚Äòon the table‚Äô for cutting.‚Äù 
Hillary Clinton seized the opportunity presented by the Trump-generated split in the GOP to create a ruling class consensus and headquarters in her own campaign tent. It was the ultimate betrayal, the incubator of a thoroughly corporatized Democratic Party ‚Äì an undertaker of social democracy. Instead, the White Deplorables derailed her, as they had earlier derailed the Republican corporate establishment. 
Thus, the crisis of legitimacy in U.S. ruling institutions deepens. 
It now appears, in the early hours of President Elect Donald Trump, that the new administration will be a conventional rightwing Republican regime, with a cast of villains including Newt ‚ÄúContract with America‚Äù Gingrich, and a Vice President Mike Pence in the role of Dick ‚ÄúThe Real President‚Äù Cheney. Maybe Trump will insist on giving peace with Russia and China a chance, maybe not. The Trans Pacific Pipeline is probably dead, unless it can somehow be resurrected in the lame duck session of Congress that begins next week, but there is no way Republicans or Democrats will slap 35 percent tariffs on U.S. corporations‚Äô foreign-produced goods. That‚Äôs rhetorical theater a la Trump. 
The Trump regime has no fix for the ills of late stage capitalism that have immiserated both the triumphant Deplorables and the darker folks they scapegoat, and whom they can be counted on to harass, repress and deport. Neither does the Democratic Party, whose next administration, had it not been still-born, would have served the interests of the One Percent even more dependably than did Obama. 
Leave Hillary‚Äôs nasty tent in the dirt, where it lies. The people need vibrant social movements that will produce new leadership in struggle and shape the parties of the future. BAR executive editor Glen Ford can be contacted  ",1

‚ÄúWe are witnessing the end of the neoliberal era,‚Äù said Dr. Cornel West , the nation‚Äôs most prominent Black public intellectual, assessing the import of last week‚Äôs election. West backed Bernie Sanders in the Democratic primaries, then endorsed the Green Party‚Äôs presidential ticket. The election ‚Äúdid not go left-populist, following Bernie Sanders and Jill Stein,‚Äù he said. Instead, ‚Äúit went rightwing-fascist. But the neoliberal era is coming to a close and the neoliberal establishment is being exposed. The issues of class now are becoming much more central.‚Äù Trump Supporters Mounted an ‚ÄúInsurrection‚Äù 
Duboisian scholar Dr. Anthony Monteiro was among the few observers on the Left that thought Donald Trump would win at the polls. But, even he was startled at the scope of Trump‚Äôs sweep. ‚ÄúI felt that the insurgency would grow and deepen, but I never thought that it would become an insurrection,‚Äù said Monteiro. ‚ÄúIn a certain sense, white working and poor people in these small, rust belt towns have a sense of achievement in having brought the Clintons down that Black people had in 2008 when Barack Obama was elected with a huge Black turnout,‚Äù he said. Monteiro is one of the organizers of a Conference on Political Science for Radical Times, set for December 9-10, in Philadelphia. TPP ‚ÄúOn Its Death Bed‚Äù 
With Donald Trump‚Äôs victory, President Obama‚Äôs Trans Pacific Partnership corporate rights trade deal is ‚Äúlooking like it‚Äôs on its death bed,‚Äù said Kevin Zeese , of Popular Resistance. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôve worked for five years to make TPP stand for Toxic Political Poison, and that seems to have happened,‚Äù said Zeese. Trump won in ‚Äúthe rust belt that was destroyed by NAFTA‚Äù -- Bill Clinton‚Äôs jobs-exporting bill of a generation ago -- ‚Äúand was going to be threatened again by TPP.‚Äù Zeese said Obama may make a last bid to pass TPP in the lame duck session of Congress that begins this week. Finally, a Practical Guide to Black Self-Determination 
The Black is Back Coalition for Social Justice, Peace and Reparations adopted a 19-point Black Political Agenda for Self-Determination, at a conference in Washington. The document applies the principle of self-determination to the broadest range of issues, from Black Community Control of the Police, to Mass Black Incarceration, to Nationalization of the Banks. ‚ÄúEverybody wants self-determination,‚Äù said Coalition chairman Omali Yeshitela , ‚Äúbut what does it mean, practically?‚Äù The 19 points give direction to the struggle. ‚ÄúThis isn‚Äôt something you work on every four years,‚Äù said Yeshitela. ‚ÄúThis is something you work on every day. This is our program.‚Äù 
Margaret Kimberley , an editor and senior columnist for Black Agenda Report, told the conference: ‚ÄúWhen we meet together, today, we are showing the world what self-determination looks like.‚Äù Voting for ‚Äúyour enemies‚Äù is not self-determination, and ‚Äúthinking that electoral politics is the only road to liberation is not self-determination,‚Äù said Kimberley. Black Agenda Radio on the Progressive Radio Network is hosted by Glen Ford and Nellie Bailey. A new edition of the program airs every Monday at 11:00am ET on PRN. Length: one hour.",1

Freedom Rider: Obama‚Äôs Hollow Legacy | Black Agenda Report,"2016 presidential campaign by BAR editor and senior columnist Margaret Kimberley 
Democrats used to value things like global peace and justice in the workplace. But, for decades they have given their votes to warmongers and job-exporters. This week, they are mourning the defeat of a politician they once would have despised. In January, lots of Black Democrats will cry over the exit of a president who ‚Äúwon by making himself palatable to white people while also taking advantage of undeserved black pride.‚Äù Freedom Rider: Obama‚Äôs Hollow Legacy by BAR editor and senior columnist Margaret Kimberley 
‚ÄúThe sight of Barack and Michelle hosting a state dinner was enough to make black hearts swoon.‚Äù 
Obama‚Äôs legacy is in tatters, and that is good news. Donald Trump‚Äôs victory was not just a win over Hillary Clinton, but against Democratic Party policies that silenced the rank and file. For years Democrats became convinced that the only means of keeping Republicans at bay was to go along with their party leadership without complaint. If they wanted to expand trade deals that stole workers‚Äô jobs, so be it. The people who marched against the invasion of Iraq folded their tents when Democrats became the party of endless war. When Obama promoted austerity and ‚Äúgrand bargains‚Äù with Republicans not a word was uttered. Even Black Lives Matter refused to point out that the Obama Justice Department left killer cops unpunished. 
Barack Obama is nothing if not consistent. While Democrats take to the streets in protest against president elect Trump, Obama declares that the man he once called unfit is not an ideologue, but a ‚Äúpragmatist.‚Äù No one should be surprised about the conciliatory tone. Obama never had a problem with Republicans. They may have obstructed him, but he was always happy to assist them because he wasn‚Äôt really opposed to their policies. 
The most obvious example of Obama‚Äôs lack of substance was his relationship with black Americans. His disdain and contempt for the people who loved him the most was clear to anyone who paid attention. Jokes about ‚Äúcousin Pookie‚Äù and parents serving fried chicken for breakfast should have been seen as the racist screeds they clearly were. But the desire to see a black face in a prominent place endures to our detriment. 
‚ÄúThe people who marched against the invasion of Iraq folded their tents when Democrats became the party of endless war.‚Äù 
Obama won by making himself palatable to white people while also taking advantage of undeserved black pride. Hillary Clinton would be the president elect if the new voters who emerged in 2008 had remained committed to the Democratic Party. But their loyalty was to the imagery of Barack Obama as president. Their joy was confined to seeing him meet the queen of England alongside his first lady or disembarking from Air Force One with his signature swagger. The sight of Barack and Michelle hosting a state dinner was enough to make black hearts swoon. Policy initiatives need not intrude upon the love fest. 
The end result of this unrequited and superficial love was six million fewer votes cast for Hillary Clinton in 2016 than for Obama in 2012. The apocryphal cousin Pookie stayed home and no one should be surprised. There is no secret to keeping voters engaged. They are engaged if their needs are met. Deliver for voters and they deliver in the voting booth. 
Even the unpopular and shady Hillary Clinton could have won Michigan if the people of Flint had received the federal help they needed so badly. Not only did the Obama environmental protection agency allow the beleaguered city to be given contaminated water, but he showed up for a photo opportunity and did nothing else as residents suffered. He drank a glass of water, posed for the cameras and returned to Washington. The people of Flint are still living under conditions Americans think of as being ‚ÄúThird World.‚Äù 
‚ÄúDemocratic voters must ask themselves why they said nothing when their party promoted trade deals that were against their interests.‚Äù 
The response to Trump‚Äôs victory should mean more than protesting policies the Democrats now have little ability to fight. This moment presents an opportunity for much needed introspection and mea culpas. Millions of people did more than just accept Democratic Party policy. They supported actions they would have rejected if carried out by a Republican or a white Democrat. They supported Muammar Gaddafi when Republicans were president but averted their eyes to his murder when committed by a Democrat. They even voted for the person who bragged about the killing. Democratic voters must ask themselves why they said nothing when their party promoted trade deals that were against their interests. Ultimately that acquiescence led to defeat at Trump‚Äôs hands. 
The Obama team‚Äôs propaganda skills were legendary but the day of reckoning revealed the emptiness of what they produced. The corporate media acted like scribes under White House direction and declared that Russia was an enemy state and its president a 21 st century Hitler. Now it is Donald Trump, the self-promoting reality television star, who declares his willingness to talk to his Russian counterpart. It is the sort of behavior that Democrats once valued. 
Democratic presidents Jimmy Carter and Bill Clinton began the tradition of getting Democrats to support what they didn‚Äôt like. Obama perfected the art, which ultimately led to the debacle. He will certainly not be the last to tempt the party faithful but in 2016 Democrats sold their souls and ended up with nothing. Defeat creates the most hollow feelings of all.

War Less Imminent After Clinton Defeat,"2016 presidential campaign A Black Agenda Radio commentary by executive editor Glen Ford 
Are most Americans warlike, or are they just easily misled into going along with the War Party that dominates both halves of the duopoly? In a certain sense, the distinction doesn‚Äôt matter. Most American don‚Äôt care enough about the lives of the millions of victims of U.S. empire to do much of anything to save them. And, if they voted for Hillary Clinton, they did not even have the presence of mind to save themselves from nuclear annihilation. War Less Imminent After Clinton Defeat A Black Agenda Radio commentary by executive editor Glen Ford 
‚ÄúTrump says he wants to cooperate with the Syrians and the Russians to defeat ISIS.‚Äù 
With so many people who call themselves liberals and leftists tearing their hair out in dread of a President Donald Trump, it is necessary to point out that the prospects of avoiding nuclear war are much better than they were the day before the election. Hillary Clinton was committed to imposing a ‚Äúno fly zone‚Äù over Syria that would have meant instant war with Russia, likely resulting in the annihilation of the human species. You‚Äôd think that would have made Clinton anathema to decent people. But Americans, including those who call themselves liberals, are not decent people ‚Äì not really. Based on their political behavior, they just pretend to be decent, but support U.S. governments that have slaughtered millions since the end of World War Two. If you voted for Obama and Clinton, you gave your assent to continuing George Bush‚Äôs wars, allowing Obama to start two major wars of his own, in Libya and Syria, and to Hillary Clinton‚Äôs plans to roll the nuclear dice on the fate of humanity. The whole world knows that Americans are dangerous, to themselves and to others. But, decent? Since when, and to whom? 
Donald Trump looks and talks like the ugly, racist, bullying American -- and he is exactly that, but he hasn‚Äôt killed anybody yet, and his public statements have been of a far more peaceful nature than the woman he beat at the polls. Trump says he wants to cooperate with the Syrians and the Russians to defeat ISIS. Trump also does not make distinctions between the various Islamic jihadist groups in Syria, unlike the Obama administration, which has directly and indirectly armed and funded all of the jihadist groups, and has spent much of the last several months trying to protect the al Nusra Front, the al Qaida affiliate in eastern Aleppo, from Russian bombing. 
‚ÄúThe jihadists are in despair, and the prospects for driving them out of Aleppo look promising.‚Äù 
No sooner had the votes been counted, than President Obama ordered U.S. Special Forces to go all-out to kill the leadership of al-Nusra. 
This war has been entirely based on lies, so Obama will probably limit his Kill List to al Qaida leaders, while sparing the rank and file jihadist fighters for future use by the United States. But it is safe to say that, had Hillary Clinton been elected, the most warlike factions in the U.S. military, the CIA, the State Department, and the foreign policy establishment at-large would be setting the stage for full-scale confrontation with Russia and all of Syria‚Äôs allies under President Clinton. Instead, the jihadists are in despair, and the prospects for driving them out of Aleppo look promising. Hopefully, the Syrian government and its friends will be on the road to victory before Donald Trump‚Äôs presidency is decisively captured by the bipartisan War Party that runs the empire. 
Syrian President Bashar Assad says it‚Äôs fine with him if Trump wants to fight the terrorists. But, Assad isn‚Äôt sure that Trump can deliver on his campaign pledge. ‚ÄúWhat about the countervailing forces within the administration, the mainstream media that were against him?‚Äù Assad asks . Assad thinks the notion of Trump bucking the War Party is ‚Äúdubious.‚Äù He‚Äôs right. Half a million Syrians are dead because most Americans don‚Äôt much care who their government kills, as long as they‚Äôre not white. But, getting rid of Clinton has slowed the War Party down a bit, and maybe prevented a nuclear war. If you are a decent person, you should be pleased about that.

Federal Judge Orders Water Delivery to Flint Residents,"Tweet Widget by BAR editor and columnist Dr. Marsha Adebayo 
Lead kills brain cells, but it took a federal judge to order that households in Flint, Michigan, be delivered four cases of bottled water to prevent further damage to their health. Meanwhile, the perpetrators of the mass poisoning ‚Äúwere rewarded with blanket immunity and protection by the State.‚Äù One wonders, ‚ÄúHow different the reaction of the Obama administration would have been had ISIS claimed responsibility for poisoning Flint?‚Äù Federal Judge Orders Water Delivery to Flint Residents by BAR editor and columnist Dr. Marsha Adebayo 
‚Äú The Flint water crisis is the pathway for future genocidal acts against Africans in America just as the Tuskegee experiment was the pathway to Flint.‚Äù 
For nearly one year, EPA and state officials (and presumably the president) knew, according to Congressional testimony, that residents of Flint, Michigan, were drinking, bathing, washing dishes in lead-poisoned water, and providing formula laced with poisoned water to infants. There is little hope for Flint‚Äôs predominantly black children who have ingested, and absorbed dangerous levels of lead. The poisoning of Flint‚Äôs water supply was simply the latest act of domestic terrorism towards Africans in America. 
But, the horror of the Flint water crisis has not stopped. What has stopped is the corporate media coverage of the carnage. This week, a federal judge, David Lawson, ruled that residents of Flint who continue to face lead contamination of their water supply are entitled to delivery of free bottled water to their homes. State officials must deliver each week four cases of bottled water to Flint households that don‚Äôt have ‚Äúproperly installed taps.‚Äù This ruling, while important, clearly falls short of the dignity and respect Flint residents deserve. In fact, the State of Michigan, without remorse or shame, has argued against such provisions. 
‚ÄúIf the residents of Flint were considered fully human or valued citizens why should they have to fight for the provision of clean water?‚Äù 
Flint residents have complained that the approximate $234 million that has been committed by the state of Michigan is inadequate to replace lead service lines, provide additional healthcare, clean water and water filters. Victims of this crisis have voiced concern that phone lines to arrange for water delivery and staffing at water stations have proved insufficient to meet the needs of the community. In addition, the State reduced service hours and eliminated service at water supply stations altogether on Sundays. One resident complained: 
‚ÄúMost of the people who‚Äôve called [the phone service] never had people come out. It‚Äôs just not staffed.‚Äù 
The State has argued that water delivery to qualifying households is an additional unnecessary expense costing $9 million. It was this same kind of argument that led the City Manager appointed by Michigan Governor Rick Snyder in April, 2014, to switch the city‚Äôs water supply to the polluted Flint River and then failed to require the city, because of financial considerations, to use corrosion controls to prevent lead from leaching off water pipes to private homes. If the residents of Flint were considered fully human or valued citizens why should they have to fight for the provision of clean water? As humans and citizens this is their right! The State has shown, once again, that Black lives do not matter in Flint and that residents will have to fight for life-sustaining water. 
The poisoning of Flint water should be considered an act of terror and should have been prosecuted under US terrorism laws and all involved indicted for domestic terror. But not one senior EPA or state official was fired or indicted -- criminal blame was reserved for low-level technicians. The poisoning was never treated as an ‚Äúemergency‚Äù situation. In fact, until residents of Flint started to protest, federal and state officials were content to allow the poisoning to continue. 
‚ÄúVictims of this crisis have voiced concern that phone lines to arrange for water delivery and staffing at water stations have proved insufficient to meet the needs of the community.‚Äù 
What this crisis has clearly exposed is that Flint was a deliberate poisoning of a low-income Black community. The perpetrators of this terrorist act were rewarded with blanket immunity and protection by the State. The EPA Administrator and Governor of Michigan will soon reap the benefits of being ‚Äúgood Germans‚Äù as they leave public service for lucrative private sector positions. 

It took President Obama nearly two years to travel to Flint for what was promoted as a ‚Äúbriefing.‚Äù How different the reaction of the Obama administration would have been had ISIS claimed responsibility for poisoning Flint. 
The EPA had the power to issue a cease and desist order against the State of Michigan under the Safe Drinking Water Act (SDWA Section 1431) that allows the EPA to seize control of State‚Äôs water system: 
‚Äú‚Ä¶ Upon receipt of information that a contaminant that is present in or likely to enter a public water system or an underground source of drinking water ‚Ä¶ that may present an imminent and substantial endangerment to the health of persons, the EPA administrator may take any action she deems necessary to protect human health.‚Äù 
According to congressional testimony by EPA Administrator Gina McCarthy, the EPA‚Äôs paltry excuse for not invoking congressionally mandated emergency powers was that they wanted to allow Michigan State agencies enough time to settle this matter. In the interim, women suffered miscarriages, Flint residents suffered strokes, and children developed neuro-toxic levels of lead poisoning that impact their intellectual and cognitive function. 
‚Äú The EPA Administrator and Governor of Michigan will soon reap the benefits of being ‚Äògood Germans‚Äô as they leave public service for lucrative private sector positions. ‚Äù 
Members of Congress called for the resignations of both the Michigan Governor and the EPA Administrator. While Obama did not have the power to unseat an elected Governor, he has the power to fire EPA Administrator Gina McCarthy who serves at the pleasure of the president. His decision was to leave McCarthy in place presumably because of the good job she performed in Flint. What is perhaps most revealing about the background story of the poisoning incident is that President Obama, by leaving McCarthy as head of the EPA, reaffirmed his faith in her abilities to carry out the mandate of his administration, including handling the more than over 300 additional water systems throughout the country, primarily in Black and low income communities, that indicate toxic levels of lead in the water. 
History will judge that the Flint water crisis is the pathway for future genocidal acts against Africans in America just as the Tuskegee experiment was the pathway to Flint. One should note that the Tuskegee experiment (1932-1972), conducted by the US Public Health Service, consisted initially of a sample size of 399 Black men. The Flint water poisoning ‚Äúexperiment‚Äù (starting in 2014) consisted of a city of nearly 100,000 residents. The escalation of organized violence, such as Tuskegee and Flint should trigger a mass movement to protect African life particularly as we contemplate policies of the Trump Administration.

System Breakdown: Trump's Chickens Come Home to Roost,"2016 presidential campaign by Danny Haiphong 
The crisis that has enveloped U.S. imperialism, under both Republican and Democratic rule, rocked the corporate duopoly system and opened the door for Donald Trump's ascension to power. Decades ago, ‚Äúthe Republicans became the White Man‚Äôs Party while the Democrats neutralized the left.‚Äù Trump is the result. ‚ÄúA genuine, radical left with any vision at all would not tremble before a Donald Trump Administration or mourn a Clinton loss.‚Äù System Breakdown: Trump's Chickens Come Home to Roost by Danny Haiphong 
‚ÄúThe left can no longer afford to suppress the material struggle for liberation in place of a rhetorical struggle against racism.‚Äù 
A number of people dropped their jaw in fear after Trump's victory in the 2016 elections. My jaw dropped for a different reason. Trump's victory occurred without the support of the ruling class. Most of his supporters came from the disaffected white working class and petit bourgeoisie (think ""small"" business). The Trump victory is thus a monumental moment in US history. The two-party corporate duopoly could not have drawn a worse hand and the ruling class has settled with Trump out of sheer limitation. US imperialism is in a state of system breakdown. The chickens have come home to roost. 
So how did Trump win? For one, Trump's legions were the only section of the voting age population energized to vote. As BAR's Bruce Dixon has noted , voter suppression has been a common practice in most states for decades. This combined with nearly four decades of capitalist crisis has placed the US political system in a dead-end situation. The Democratic Party has become the truest expression of the ruling capitalist class over this period. It instituted the trade deals, wars, austerity policies, and expanded the police and prison forces necessary to maintain the rule of capitalism in decline. The material conditions of the crisis these policies set into motion ultimately opened the door for Trump's chickens to come home to roost. 
‚ÄúUS imperialism is in a state of system breakdown.‚Äù 
Trump's base is on the move namely to resurrect more favorable economic conditions, historically distributed on a racial basis, of a prior stage of capitalism. War on behalf of industrial capital once distributed income and wealth more favorably to a larger portion of whites. Capitalist decline has forever changed these conditions. The Democratic Party and Republican Party are both responsible for the current conditions of depravity, racism, and neo-liberal psychosis that currently plagues US society. Starting in the 1970s, the Republicans became the White Man‚Äôs Party while the Democrats neutralized the left. Four decades of two-party misery greatly influenced the outcome of the 2016 elections. 
What is striking about Trump's base is how it was able to compel the Electoral College to betray the wishes of the ruling class. During the Democratic primary, delegates were more than happy to abandon popular will in favor of Clinton. But much has changed since the Democratic Party suppressed the Sanders campaign. WikiLeaks exposed the many crimes of Hillary Clinton. Although Clinton won the popular vote, many Black, Latino, union, and women voters decided not to opt for her as President. Those that did held their nose and were thus seen as less of a threat to the ruling class than the possibility of a dejected Trump base. 
‚Äú The Democratic Party and Republican Party are both responsible for the current conditions of depravity, racism, and neo-liberal psychosis that currently plagues US society.‚Äù 
The left in the US must come to terms with reality. It has spent decades trailing behind the crisis of imperialism by throwing its full support to the Democratic Party appendage of the ruling class. So-called white liberals in particular ridiculed the supposedly backward character of white workers and acted as if they possessed an anti-racist bone in their own bodies. The liberal-left as a whole bound themselves to the party of dead-end capitalism in order to avoid the party of the White Man. It was only a matter of time before the two-party corporate duopoly would rupture under the weight of its own contradictions. 
The Trump Administration is thus a logical conclusion of, and not a resolution to, the contradictions of imperialism. The left must now confront what it has avoided for too long. Never has it been clearer that Trump is the logical conclusion to the misery of life under US imperialism. The Democrats overplayed their hand, thinking that rhetoric alone could maintain its false image as the ""left"" wing of the two-party system. Yet even though the Democrats have consistently betrayed their base on behalf of the ruling class, millions of Clinton supporters are in a state of mourning over her loss. 
‚ÄúThe liberal-left as a whole bound themselves to the party of dead-end capitalism in order to avoid the party of the White Man.‚Äù 
A genuine, radical left with any vision at all would not tremble before the feet of a Donald Trump Administration or mourn a Clinton loss. The left must explore the many facets of the Trump development. It must no longer ignore the white workers and petty bourgeois Trump supporters that have brought real material demands to the fore. The left can no longer afford to suppress the material struggle for liberation in place of a rhetorical struggle against racism. The ruling class is in disarray and the Trump victory proves it. 
A Trump Presidency won't be a simple trip to the apocalypse. Even with a majority in the House and the Senate, the Republican Party must now choose to align itself to Trumpist politics or continue to collaborate with the Democratic Party to destroy him. There is no doubt that Wall Street, the military industrial complex, and the rest of the bourgeoisie will attempt to control the unpredictable white nationalist billionaire. The New York Times has already made overtures about a ""conflict of interest"" between his business investments and his newfound political position. Of course, the Times never had an issue with Obama when he bailed out Wall Street or chose his cabinet from a list provided by Citigroup. 
‚Äú The left must take advantage of the internal squabbling among the ruling class that is surely to come.‚Äù 
Trump is no Wall Street politician so he will inevitably face many contradictions while in office. Will he respect his base's wishes to build mutual ties with Russia and rollback NATO? Will he keep his promise to rid of NAFTA and the TPP? Or will he capitulate to the ruling class, angering his base and potentially setting up an early grave for his Administration? And what will the bourgeoisie do should they not be able to control him? All of these questions must be asked. The left must take advantage of the internal squabbling among the ruling class that is surely to come. Conditions remain favorable to organize a truly radical, left political agenda for social transformation. 
The ruling class will attempt to neutralize the left by controlling Trump‚Äôs agenda and simultaneously piecing together the Democratic Party for the 2020 elections. It remains to be seen whether this will effectively save the system from collapse. Because the truth is, Trump is not a reflection of some American apocalypse. His victory is a product of system breakdown. Over the next four years, it would serve the left well to defeat any possibility of a Democratic Party resurrection so a true party of the people can arise in this moment of opportunity. Liberals will mourn, but revolutionaries will fight. Danny Haiphong is an Asian activist and political analyst in the Boston area. He can be reached at [email protected]",1
Actually Existing Fascism,"Tweet Widget by Dolores Vek 
It appears that millions of folks that have tolerated -- and even cheered -- Barack Obama‚Äôs Kill Lists, assassinations of whole nations, and abject service to the ruling class, are suddenly panicking at the prospect of fascism. ‚ÄúSo where the fuck were all these protesters when Obama was actually doing what Trump says he‚Äôll do?‚Äù They fear the fascism of their imaginations, while oblivious to fascism in the real world. Actually Existing Fascism by Dolores Vek 
This article previously appeared on the author‚Äôs web site, Dolores Vek Cultural Marxism-Leninism . 
‚Äú Anyone who thinks Donald Trump is more of a fascist than Barack Obama is some combination of an imbecile, a liberal, and a charlatan.‚Äù 
With the election of Donald Trump, we‚Äôre being told that now is the time to fear fascism in America. 
What is this nightmare-vision of a fascist America supposed to look like? This alternate-reality USA, under the uniquely vicious reign of the Trump regime, is one in which minorities have to fear for their lives. The president will speak in openly white supremacist language. Black Americans will have to fear death at the hands of police and vigilantes; [email protected] will have to fear deportation; Muslims, Islamophobic violence; and so on. The good people of humanity will tremble as Trump wields America‚Äôs fearsome armed forces, secret police, elite death squads, drones, and surveillance technology for the good of himself and his cronies. Earth‚Äôs ecosystem‚Äîthe very promise of a habitable planet‚Äîwill be sacrificed by men who put profits ahead of human needs and the good of mankind. 
Truly, fascist America would a terrifying place. This vision is so terrifying that mere days after the election, even the most conformist liberals have suddenly gotten in touch with the radical antifa apparently slumbering inside each one of them. Highly publicized protests have already occurred in several major cities. Democratic Party propaganda organ Daily Kos , which banned criticisms of Hillary site-wide in March 2016, is suddenly receptive to a planned general strike on inauguration day. Those who can manage to unscrew themselves from the fetal position are resolute in their opposition to Trump‚Äôs agenda‚Äî‚Äú we have all been radicalized ,‚Äù writes future Molotov-thrower Lena Dunham. All these new radicals, radicalized by Trump‚Äôs racist language. Radicalized by the way his administration threatens non-whites with state violence. Radicalized by the fact that he‚Äôll be Commander-in-Chief, and he‚Äôll use that power to kill. 
‚ÄúDemocratic Party propaganda organ Daily Kos, which banned criticisms of Hillary site-wide in March 2016, is suddenly receptive to a planned general strike on inauguration day.‚Äù 
So where the fuck were all these protesters when Obama was actually doing what Trump says he‚Äôll do? Trump‚Äôs neo-Nazi dystopia is the USA that exists today, and anyone who doesn‚Äôt realize it needs to shut the fuck up and stop pretending to know anything about politics. Anyone who thinks Donald Trump is more of a fascist than Barack Obama is some combination of an imbecile, a liberal, and a charlatan. 
Barack Obama was the President who expanded the White House‚Äôs power to kill anyone, anywhere, including American citizens. If wielding power like a f√ºhrer is the mark of fascism, then Obama qualified as of the 2012 passage of the NDAA . 
It seems like every dire warning about the Trump administration starts with a bit about the millions of immigrant families that might be torn apart. Many Trump voters would salivate over the prospect of deporting 2.5 million people, as Obama has done‚Äîmore than every 20th century president combined. Along the way, the Obama administration has created countless millions of refugees by destroying Honduras and Libya, towards whom the president has shown a remarkable callousness that doesn‚Äôt seem to trouble these Democrats suddenly frightened on behalf of immigrants. 
Trump said that he wants to ban Muslims from entering the United States. In 2009, as Obama began his time in the White House, prosecutions for ‚Äúhomegrown terrorism‚Äù shot up, as the Obama Department of Justice focused on a Muslim enemy within. By 2010, in the face of nativist hysteria over a ‚ÄúGround Zero mosque,‚Äù the most stirring defense the President could muster was that Muslims were free to practice where they want but they probably shouldn‚Äôt . This was at the same time that the NYPD, trained and likely acting on behalf of the CIA, was spying on tens of thousands of Muslim-Americans throughout the US Northeast. Anyone deluded enough to think Barack Obama is a friend to Muslims should ask Tarek Mehanna, Abdulrahman al-Awlaki, or the hundreds of thousands of Libyans, Yemenis, Pakistanis, Afghans, Iraqis, Somalis, or Iranians who his administration has killed, displaced, maimed, starved, or terrorized. And with less than a week before the election, Barack Obama agreed to appear on HBO‚Äôs Real Time hosted by Bill Maher, a virulent liberal Islamophobe who has spent years peddling Trumpian bigotry against Muslims. 
‚ÄúThe Obama administration has created countless millions of refugees by destroying Honduras and Libya.‚Äù 
Liberals are horrified by Trump‚Äôs hatred of journalists, which is supposed to be a sign of his aberrant fascist tendencies. Before the Snowden leak spectacle largely wiped of from the news cycle, progressive outlets had started to cover the Obama administration‚Äôs war on journalism, which was sending whistleblowers and their journalist allies to prison at an unprecedented rate. Of course, while Trump‚Äôs dislike of journalists makes him Hitleresque , Obama‚Äôs actual imprisonment of journalists was, at worst, Nixonian . 
Trump will, apparently unlike every president in AmeriKKKan history, be uniquely bad for African-Americans. Will his administration steal the wealth from black homes, the way Obama helped Wall Street loot black America? Will black Americans have to rise up in the streets and declare that black lives matter, to protest the black person murdered every 28 hours in the USA? Will black revolutionaries start being mysteriously and brutally murdered in Trump‚Äôs America, like Darren Seals and at least 5 other activists in Ferguson, all of whom bear the hallmarks of falling victim to a COINTELPRO 2.0? Will a Trump Justice Department ramp-up efforts to capture fugitive black freedom fighters like Assata Shakur ? 
Even the idea that Trump and the Republicans are the only ones to speak in openly white supremacist language is idiotic, and someone doesn‚Äôt have to go back to Hillary Clinton talking about ‚Äúsuper-predators‚Äù to find examples. As one blog pointed out: 
Obama‚Äôs 2008 ‚Äúspeech on race‚Äù in Philadelphia (officially titled ‚ÄúA More Perfect Union‚Äù), celebrated as ‚Äútoo good for today‚Äôs media‚Äù and ‚Äúreviving the spirit of the nation itself,‚Äù was a Eucharistic repetition of white supremacist lies. In this speech, the future president delivered an objectively white supremacist view of US history, deriding the idea that white racism is endemic, equating the liberation theology of Jeremiah Wright with the latent anti-black racism of his grandmother, and accusing black radicals and revolutionary anti-racists of fomenting ‚Äúdisunity‚Äù at a time when ‚Äúwe‚Äù need to come together‚Äîwhile pointing to his own candidacy as proof that racism had mostly been dismantled. Minus the well-worn details about the Senator‚Äôs life story and tedious speechifying, the basic lessons of the speech would have been at home on a Fox News panel about ‚Äúrace hustlers.‚Äù 
One thing is true, though: Trump is uniquely bad in certain ways. The Donald, that two-bit reality-TV huckster, is sullying the august White House walls with his conciliatory attitude towards Russia and China (though his quick about-face on US troops in the southern half of the Korean peninsula is an indication of how serious this is). Still, after a year of Hillary Clinton sounding the drums of war, the Democrats are seemingly united in fury that Trump is a little frigid towards the idea of starting World War III. To be fair to them, they‚Äôre absolutely right: Trump can‚Äôt claim Hillary‚Äôs feverish desire for a nuclear war against Russia, nor her proven track record of killing millions of people throughout the global South. 
‚ÄúWhile Trump‚Äôs dislike of journalists makes him Hitleresque, Obama‚Äôs actual imprisonment of journalists was, at worst, Nixonian.‚Äù 
Anyone who hasn‚Äôt surrendered the last lobe of their brain to the Democratic Party, and who‚Äôs fond of not being turned into ashes, has to ask themselves why it would be desirable for President Trump to start WW3, as Clinton practically promised to do. This is another question that Nate Silver would get completely wrong, but I think the actually existing fascism of Obama offers a clue. Just like Democrats have transferred all of Obama‚Äôs evils to the Nazi caricature of Trump, liberals are the ones who are lashing out against reality. 
The reality is that capitalism, particularly at this stage, has nothing good to offer the vast majority of humanity, and even increasing numbers of people in the core. Democrats conveniently forget that the current occupant of 1600 Pennsylvania rose to power based on illusory promises to make things better. Like Trump, his record spoke to the absurdity of his bill of goods, and he boasted a CV only marginally more impressive than ‚Äúshady tycoon and TV personality.‚Äù Even though his economic promises were vague, all the ‚Äúhope‚Äù talk gave people a lot of ideas; when it came time to govern, Obama defended capital against ‚Äú the pitchforks ,‚Äù as he always intended. If apathetic voters and fucked-over workers played a part in Trump‚Äôs election, why wouldn‚Äôt they? And how will the upper-middle class and rich liberal who benefit from this order respond? As one commentator observed, in a story that is typical of America‚Äôs sneering liberal bourgeois: 
A Seattle-area friend who lives in the farther working-class suburbs came to work to his inner-city, wealthy liberal coworkers bitching that his neighbors ‚Äúvoted us into fascism.‚Äù In the same breath, this rich shit complained about the passing of a transportation bill that would raise their taxes: ‚ÄúIf they want Trump so bad they can pay for their own buses.‚Äù Here‚Äôs someone who probably calls themselves a progressive attacking actually existing progressivism because their taxes will go up a split hair, and potentially benefit unworthy types, ‚Äúdeplorables.‚Äù Maybe these people wouldn‚Äôt feel the need to ‚Äúshake things up‚Äù if they had had what they needed to thrive all along. But then your misty piney mossy caf√©-flanked Seattle townhome might have to fit only one Subaru in the garage. 
‚Äú Trump now owns whatever happens under his presidency,‚Äù writes another newly energized rebel at Daily Kos . Not Obama. Obama, like any high-status Democrat, is never responsible for what he creates, and when he is, it‚Äôs at worst a mistake. Actually existing fascism has been erected through a series of bumbles, hypocrisies, mistakes, and odd little ironies. Obama has never been culpable for what he does; today, Democrats wail that Hillary‚Äôs worse crime was being imperfect. The bourgeois elements that are the most visible Democrats can never own up to the fact that their alleged ‚Äúbase‚Äù doesn‚Äôt have any good reason to come out and vote for them. So like the Red State-bogeymen they invoke so frequently, liberals are sprinting away from reality into a bubble of comforting myths and idols. 
‚ÄúObama has never been culpable for what he does.‚Äù 
Rather than face up to the fact that Hillary Clinton has little appeal outside of Goldman Sachs and whatever the Project for a New American Century is called these days, Democrats are cursing Sanders fans, third-party voters, and non-voters with a hatred usually reserved for vegans. Since they can only imagine their own upper-middle class lives orbiting major urban centers, the loudest Democrats think that everyone who‚Äôs not exactly like them is a racist, woman-hating cretin, and hope ‚Äú that they be educated and moved to the vicinity of the major hubs in the northeast and western parts, that they die off [or] that a country would attack the United States and obliterate them.‚Äù Rather than actually learn anything of substance, liberals are doing the only thing their politics really involve: sharing and commiserating over an extremely circumscribed set of insipid pop-culture references that flatter them and insulate them from reality . Those leftist critiques of Obama or Clinton that do manage to penetrate this fantasy-world get angrily dismissed as right-wing media conspiracy theories or Kremlin propaganda. And finally, as with any good whitewash, liberals are going to pretend that Donald Trump represents something totally alien and uniquely menacing, as though Obama hasn‚Äôt done everything Trump says he will. 
‚ÄúWhen it came time to govern, Obama defended capital against ‚Äú the pitchforks ,‚Äù as he always intended.‚Äù 
And now, as soon as humanity has its first shot at finally being rid of the Clintons, and taking a small step back from the brink of ultimate atomic horror, these people want to gnash their teeth about America finally becoming fascist. 
Fuck them. 
If Trump is a fascist, them countless prominent American liberals are too, chief among them the widely beloved Barack Obama. Contemporary America doesn‚Äôt look like Nazi Germany for the simple reason that it isn‚Äôt Nazi Germany (J. Sakai argues that ‚Äú Settlerism filled the space that fascism normally occupies‚Äù). What the Democrats offer is a slightly more ‚Äúwoke fascism,‚Äù in which the slave-owning settlers are remade in entertainment media as cool black guys , with all the ‚Äúproblematic‚Äù racist history elided via a harmonious multi-ethnic makeover. It‚Äôs worth noting that Donald Trump makes overtures to the same woke fascism as Obama and Clinton: after the Pulse nightclub massacre, Trump promised to defend ‚Äú the LGBTQ community ‚Äù from foreign attackers. In other words, Trump and Clinton alike promise a typically colonialist defense of liberal values like gay rights from the swarthy hordes. 
So color me unim-fucking-pressed that now that a blatantly villainous Republican is headed for the White House, everyone is talking about a united front against fascism. Of course, given that the vast majority of the newly radicalized loved and still love the child-murdering white supremacist Barack Obama, what we‚Äôre talking about is a just another united front against the GOP. 
I know it‚Äôs ancient history to be talking about the Bush years, just like it‚Äôs hopelessly pass√© to unironically talk about ‚Äúimperialism‚Äù in 2016, but please indulge me. I remember back when George W. Bush was president, torturing people around the world, ‚Äúshredding the Constitution,‚Äù attacking Iraq and Afghanistan and threatening Iran with nukes. At the time, it was pretty common, even popular and fashionable, to call the president a fascist. Even on TV! Everyone who wasn‚Äôt a Republican was radical: it seemed like Democrats and communists alike could gripe over everything from a stolen Florida election to the invasion of Iraq. 
‚ÄúWhat the Democrats offer is a slightly more ‚Äòwoke fascism.‚Äô‚Äù 
Then sometime around 2007, a neoliberal and fundamentally conservative mediocrity named Barack Obama showed up, and while he made a lot of noise about how different he was, there was almost nothing of substance to back it up. Once he was president, all the stuff that was proof of George W.‚Äôs fascism became a trifling issue, a simple mistake, or a regrettable necessity when Obama did it. As Obama continued George Bush‚Äôs legacy, and as Dick Cheney came out in support of Hillary Clinton, liberals stopped thinking of the Bush administration as a fascist criminal enterprise and started seeing it through Sorkin-colored glasses, with a George Bush-Michelle Obama hug at the twilight of the Obama presidency marking the decisive transition. 
So I actually remember how this went down the last time the mainstream was this comfortable talking about fascism‚Äîalthough the chorus was never this deafening. I remember that all the liberals quieted down about fascism when their guy was doing it. So did a lot of the radicals, to the eternal shame and discredit of those absolute frauds. As the popular Democrat Obama brought hell to millions with the brazenness of a Duce , calling the president a fascist went back to the fringes, where it had been, and where it will be again once it‚Äôs no longer politically expedient for people at the top to have us raising hell against Trump. I know exactly how this goes, since it all happened before, and not very long ago, either. And just like with Obama, whose coronation was a sort of inversion of this, I remember that anyone who‚Äôs remotely skeptical of this obviously elite-approved narrative will get dismissed as a crank or a spoilsport. 
However, maybe for now we could have some perspective. I know he‚Äôs popular and cool, but Obama‚Äôs been in office nearly a full eight years. Maybe these last 70 days, the radicals now hyperventilating over Trump could develop some idea of what Obama‚Äôs actually been doing this entire time? 
And if the still-uncompromising black revolutionary and political prisoner Mumia Abu-Jamal can say ‚ÄúIf Trump is the price we have to pay to defeat Clintonian neoliberalism‚Äìso be it,‚Äù then maybe some of the liberals still dry-heaving can pull themselves together and learn a single thing about what America and the world are really like outside their privileged little bubbles? I mean, I know how fond these people are of pretending that they‚Äôre the only adults in the room, the only people using their inside voices. Maybe they could try to be as smart as Trevor Noah keeps telling them they are. 
‚ÄúMaybe these last 70 days, the radicals now hyperventilating over Trump could develop some idea of what Obama‚Äôs actually been doing this entire time?‚Äù 
In the meantime, I‚Äôll go ahead and be skeptical about all the no pasar√°n shit that cropped up the instant Hillary lost. Maybe if the inspiring new Credulous Dipshit Brigades could name a single fucking instance of fascism that‚Äôs not practiced by Obama, then this whole thing wouldn‚Äôt look like such an obviously astroturfed, color-revolutiony scam. 
What I know for sure is that any radicals who end up calling liberals comrade in the coming weeks are allying themselves with people who want a more violent, more genocidal , and ultimately more fascist president. Almost every liberal complaint includes references to Donald Trump weakening NATO , as though that wouldn‚Äôt be one of the most progressive developments for the good of humanity. This is where liberals give themselves away: just like they wanted Obama to restore America‚Äôs reputation after Bush so it could be the most effective fortress of capitalism, they trust Clinton to be a more capable imperial steward than Trump. If you find yourself shoulder-to-shoulder with liberals at the barricades, know that your allies are fighting on behalf of American fascism, if the word means what we keep hearing it does. 
And if you think Trump is more evil than Obama or Hillary Clinton, you‚Äôre ignorant as fuck and you‚Äôre a liberal. Dolores Vek can be contacted through her web site: https://doloresvek.wordpress.com",1
Social Justice Attorney Andrea Burton: Jailed for Refusing to Remove Black Lives Matter Lapel Pin,"Tweet Widget by Bill Quigley 
A young Black lawyer from Youngstown, Ohio, had to sue a judge who held her in contempt of court for wearing a Black Lives Matter pin. The judge said his decision had nothing to do with politics. ‚ÄúThe local NAACP chapter questioned that assertion and wondered whether the Judge would have jailed Burton if she was wearing a ‚ÄòSupport the Troops‚Äô pin.‚Äù Atty. Andrea Burton ultimately agreed to wear her pin in the courthouse, but not in the courtroom. Social Justice Attorney Andrea Burton: Jailed for Refusing to Remove Black Lives Matter Lapel Pin by Bill Quigley 
‚ÄúTo remain neutral becomes an accomplice to oppression.‚Äù 
Andrea Burton, a 30 year old Ohio criminal defense lawyer, was rocketed onto the national social justice scene this summer after she was handcuffed and jailed for refusing to take off a Black Lives Matter pin while in court. 
Burton‚Äôs stance received international attention . ‚ÄúI think that you can‚Äôt remain silent or you remain a party to oppression,‚Äù she told The Washington Post . ‚ÄúI am usually a pretty agreeable person. I‚Äôm always smiling. I‚Äôm polite. I have manners. But at some point it eats away at you how any time people see you talk about Black Lives Matter, then you‚Äôre being sensitive, you‚Äôre the person who‚Äôs racist.‚Äù In interviews with local media Burton insisted ‚ÄúI'm not anti-police, I work with law enforcement and I hold them in the highest regard, and just to say for the record, I do believe all lives matter. But at this point they don't all matter equally."" 
The Black Lives Matter pin was about one inch across , the size of a nickel . Burton refused an order to remove the Black Lives matter pin by Youngstown Ohio Judge Robert Milich . Burton told the Judge she was asserting her First Amendment rights . ‚ÄúI said I‚Äôm respecting my first amendment right, that I‚Äôm not neutral to injustice, and to remain neutral becomes an accomplice to oppression.‚Äù The judge held her in contempt of court, jailed her and sentenced her to five days. After being jailed for five hours and the NAACP was called in to help, the judge released Burton pending an appeal of his decision. 
Judge Milich, who was already famous for announcing his refusal to perform any marriages on the day the U.S. Supreme Court legalized same sex marriage, told the media that his own personal opinions had nothing to do with the decision. The local NAACP chapter questioned that assertion and wondered whether the Judge would have jailed Burton if she was wearing a ‚ÄúSupport the Troops‚Äù pin. When asked by The Daily Beast , whether he would jail a lawyer for wearing a pin that said Support Our Troops, he refused to say. ‚ÄúI can‚Äôt speculate on what a political pin might be until I look at it. I just used the definition in the Black‚Äôs Law Library Dictionary, and the standard dictionary of what‚Äôs political.‚Äù The Judge further muddied the waters when he said ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs a difference between a flag, a pin from your church or the Eagles and having a pin that‚Äôs on a political issue.‚Äù 
‚ÄúBurton told the Judge she was asserting her First Amendment rights.‚Äù 
Burton paid a high price for her convictions. After she was jailed, Burton, who had been previously regularly appointed to represent numerous Youngstown Municipal criminal defendants , said she was ‚Äúfrozen out‚Äù of the appointment process for representing criminal defendants and received no appointments at all. 
Burton then filed a federal civil rights damages actio n against Judge Milich, the other Youngstown Municipal Judge, and the City of Youngstown for violations of her constitutional rights to Freedom of Speech, Due Process and Equal Protection. In the civil rights case, filed in the Northern District of Ohio, Burton pointed out police officers were in the same courtroom with black tape over their badges and the judge did nothing to them. After court monitored settlement discussions, Burton agreed to drop her federal civil rights case. In return the Judge agreed to drop her contempt charge. Burton said she will continue to wear her BLM pin in the courthouse but not inside the courtroom. Further, the settlement provided that local judges agreed not to retaliate against her and will fully consider her requests for future appointments to court-appointed cases. 
Who is this brave lawyer? 
Beginnings 
Burton grew up in Youngstown, Ohio in a family active in the civil rights movement. ‚ÄúMy grandfather marched on Washington with Martin Luther King ,‚Äù said Burton. ‚ÄúHe was a good friend of A. Phillip Randolph . He protested in the South during the Civil Rights Movements and attended the 1963 March on Washington. He was one of the first black Councilpersons for Youngstown. My mother was pretty active in the black awakening during the 60s. She was fairly militant about civil rights as a teen and was what we know now as a feminist.‚Äù 
Some of her courage is no doubt due to her upbringing. Burton‚Äôs older brother was born with a rare genetic disorder that left him mentally disabled and very sickly as a child. Dad operated a successful business despite addiction issues until his death when Burton was 15. Mom, a legal secretary and later a court bailiff, did heroic work caring for the family. 
‚ÄúMy mother‚Äôs compassion and dedication greatly influenced how empathetic I have become. She pushed me greatly to do more than what was expected, to excel when it would be simpler to be typical. She never told me that there was anything I could not do if I set my sights on achieving it. She worked hard to make the resources available to me if I actually wanted them. Both my parents were college educated. Both were heavily invested in learning. 
‚ÄúMy parents never really treated me as a child so I was often exposed to difficult realties and frank conversations. I was conscious of the ways people were different (i.e., gender, orientation, race, or class) but how it did not matter at all in determining their worth.‚Äù 
Studies 
Burton always did well in school. ‚ÄúI was expected to be a good student. My father was relentless about math grades and performances especially. I won a sport in the Junior Statesman Program at Georgetown University to study government when I was 16 years old. It was a highly competitive program that included people from all over the world. 
Burton earned a scholarship and graduated from Youngstown State University in 2008 in pre-law and journalism. She was awarded another scholarship to study for her Masters in Library and Information Science at University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign . 
‚ÄúI decided to become a lawyer as I finished my bachelor‚Äôs degree.‚Äù So after she received her graduate degree she returned to Ohio and commuted from home to attend the University of Akron School of Law . ‚ÄúThe best part of law school was working in the legal clinic.‚Äù There she wrote appellate briefs for prisoners, provided legal research to inmates, handled applications for clemency to the governor and other pro bono services to low income individuals. She took social justice classes when she could and wrote a major paper on Kelley Williams-Bolar who was convicted of a felony for enrolling her children in another better school district. ‚ÄúI wanted to study why anyone would commit a felony to educate their kids, why was it necessary? What differences where there?‚Äù 
‚ÄúShe wrote appellate briefs for prisoners, provided legal research to inmates, handled applications for clemency.‚Äù 
After becoming a lawyer, Burton began a small private practice and spent a lot of her time working as a public defender. ‚ÄúIt was a shock,‚Äù Burton admits. ‚ÄúPeople with power and influence held some bigoted ideas. People were not treated fairly and it was quite disheartening. 
‚ÄúAs a criminal defense lawyer, I am motivated by humanity, compassion and the oath I took to uphold the Constitution of the United States. I am often asked how I could represent those accused of crimes, some heinous crimes. I see criminal defense work as an opportunity to make sure that the promise that the criminal justice system makes ‚Äúinnocent until proven guilty‚Äù is followed. Getting convictions and imparting justice are two very different things. My job is to make sure that statutes and rules are followed to guarantee a fair and impartial trial. Politics should not factor into that. I am merely an instrument of justice but I take my role extremely seriously. 
‚ÄúIt is sometimes challenging to work with other attorneys and people in the justice system who are oblivious to the discrepancies people of color and impoverished people experience within the system that is set up to eradicate those inequities. I am also disappointed in people who accept the status quo just because it is easy and convenient. We need to be willing to continually re-evaluate our role in furthering injustice. 
Justice 
‚ÄúJustice sometimes comes slowly, through time, by the changing of minds through understanding and experience. Other times it is the result of tumultuous uncertain revolutions. The problem with maintaining justice is that often we only recognize what justice is by seeing injustice. Sometimes the world needs a major event, a major catalyst to stir change. That process is often frightening. To me, living in a world where we value some more than others is unjust. Especially when some are undervalued to the point that people are systematically dying. When people are too afraid to have an informed dialogue about how factors intersect to create injustice that perpetuates injustice. Willful blindness in the face of a wealth of information is the greatest threat to civilization today. 
Sustainability 
‚ÄúOne of the ways I sustain myself is that I read continuously. I read philosophy as well as political and spiritual texts. I have a close friend that I speak with virtually every week. He has been a savior for me since I was 17 years old. We understand each other because we are both avid readers, with similar interests in philosophy and in that we both have always felt a sense of isolation and disconnection from our peers. This is important because I think that more and more people feel a sense of disconnect from the world despite the many connections created through social media. 
‚ÄúWhen someone asks me for a book recommendation, I suggest Strength to Love by Martin Luther King Jr. It is a religious book, but I do not read it simply for the Christian aspects of it. I read it because it‚Äôs empowering, powerful and because King was an extremely smart compassionate person and it shows. I also read Nietzsche religiously. 
‚ÄúI am involved in the YWCA which is dedicated to eliminating racism, empowering women and promoting peace, justice, freedom and dignity for all. 
‚ÄúMy dream is that differences in color would actually be as relevant as shoe size and that religious fanaticism would disappear.‚Äù 
Advice to Law Students 
‚ÄúLearn to see value in every human being and truly read the papers that are the foundation of this Country. Study and understand the Constitution and The Federalist Papers . They demonstrate how this democracy was formulated. Know your history because it shapes today in ways you will never appreciate fully otherwise. Be prepared to examine yourself for your own conflicts in logic and your own biases. Learn how lawyers can become accomplices to injustice, even if unintentionally. 
Role Models 
‚Äú Harriet Tubman , Sojourner Truth , Alexander Hamilton , W.E.B Du Bois , Langston Hughes , James Baldwin , Gandhi , Malala Yousafzai , Martin Luther King , A. Phillip Randolph , Rosa Parks , Thurgood Marshall , Ralph Abernathy , and Joseph Lowery inspire me. Malcolm X of course. And our President Barack Obama and the First Lady Michelle Obama . I am also inspired by the countless individuals who face oppression and injustice in their lives daily but continue to work toward a better world. I am inspired by those who fight for those who are limited in power or face nearly insurmountable odds. I think the work of those individuals is the key to making the world a place where love conquers hate and fear. 
Conclusion 
‚ÄúThe day I wore that button and was found in contempt changed my life, the effect of it are still rippling, some in destructive ways and others in very inspiring ways. I wore it because my soul was so tired from all the inequities I had seen over my 4 years of practice. I was exhausted from losing a series of small battles for understanding for my vulnerable clients. I was tired of the indifference of the prosecutorial offices. And all I could think to do was wear this button for a little joy. For a small win. To hope to change someone‚Äôs mind. Bill Quigley teaches law at Loyola University New Orleans.",1

Opponents site potential environmental risks to water resources like the Missouri and Mississippi rivers to defend their stance against the 1,172-mile long pipeline, which would have the capacity to transport up to 570,000 barrels of crude oil a day from the Bakken oilfields of North Dakota to markets across the U.S. 
What many ignore, however, is another facet of the #NoDAPL [2] movement: Native sovereignty. 
Most of the confrontations between water protectors and law enforcement are occurring near the Standing Rock Reservation. The reservation currently takes up roughly 3,625 square miles [3] across southeastern North Dakota and into South Dakota. More than 8,000 people [4] live in scattered communities, all connected by a common history‚Äîone which includes land theft and treaty violations. 
The construction of the Dakota Access Pipeline has brought this history to the current day. ‚ÄúOur standoff is on treaty land, so we have every right to defend what is rightfully ours,‚Äù says Cody Hall, a Lakota civil rights activist with the Cheyenne River Tribe who has spent time on the frontlines in North Dakota. 
When he speaks of ‚Äútreaty land,‚Äù he‚Äôs referring to land allotted to the Great Sioux Nation by the Treaty of Fort Laramie of 1851 and 1868. 
‚ÄúOur standoff is on treaty land, so we have every right to defend what is rightfully ours.‚Äù 
The revised treaty established the Great Sioux Reservation in 1868, which the federal governement would eventually shrink to what became the Standing Rock Reservation. The treaty land crisscrossed between seven present-day states‚ÄîNorth Dakota, South Dakota, Nebraska, Kansas, Colorado, Wyoming and Montana‚Äîincluding the reservation and unceded territories reserved for hunting. 
These boundaries were created to ensure peace between Native people and colonizers. The temptations of gold, however, meant that travelers were soon in tribal territory. Almost immediately after its conception in 1851, the U.S. violated the treaty by not policing its citizens' entry onto Native land. 
For Native Americans, treaties function as the law of the land. Article VI of the U.S. Constitution clearly states: 
This Constitution, and the laws of the United States which shall be made in pursuance thereof; and all treaties made, or which shall be made, under the authority of the United States, shall be the supreme law of the land; and the judges in every state shall be bound thereby, anything in the Constitution or laws of any State to the contrary notwithstanding. 
The U.S. government would honor treaties‚Äîuntil they interfered with Manifest Destiny. ‚ÄúIt was all about colonial expansion,‚Äù says Frank Pommersheim, a professor at the University of South Dakota School of Law who specializes in Indian law. In 1877, without consent from the Sioux, the United States stole their sacred Black Hills. The land was the center of their world, their birthplace. 
This act set in stone U.S.-tribal relations. From then on, the United States slowly diminished the land it left for tribal peoples. By 1889, the Great Sioux Reservation became what it is today: 3,625 square miles tucked between North and South Dakota, stripped of ancestral burial grounds and lush buffalo populations with which the Sioux used to coexist. 
In 1903, fewer than 30 years after the Black Hills seizement, the Supreme Court ruled in Lone Wolf v. Hitchcock [5] that Congress may unilaterally break treaties between the U.S. and Native Americans using its plenary power. ‚ÄúIt is unfortunately a part of American law. That basic precept is totally unacceptable to Native people in the context of treaties,‚Äù Pommersheim explains. ""It is just a collision between cultures and different understandings and interpretation of what treaties actually mean."" 
‚ÄúAlmost immediately after its conception in 1851, the U.S. violated the treaty by not policing its citizens' entry onto Native land.‚Äù 
He is correct that a vast number of Native Americans find this unacceptable. 
‚ÄúTo us [these treaties] are very much still alive and a part of our everyday life,‚Äù says Remi Bald Eagle, the intergovernmental affairs coordinator for the Cheyenne River Sioux Tribe in South Dakota. ‚ÄúWe still honor those treaties, and I know the chairman has said that he expects America to do the same.‚Äù 
And while the U.S. has violated said treaties over the past century, it‚Äôs never declared the treaties null or void, Bald Eagle adds. 
With the Treaty of Fort Laramie in mind, water protectors opposing the Dakota Access Pipeline have tried to take action. On October 23, pipeline opponents declared eminent domain [6] over land owned by Energy Transfer, the company behind the pipeline, by citing the treaty. Joye Braun, an Indigenous Environmental Network organizer, said in a statement: 
We have never ceded this land. If DAPL can go through and claim eminent domain on landowners and Native peoples on their own land, then we as sovereign nations can then declare eminent domain on our own aboriginal homeland. We are here to protect the burial sites here. Highway 1806 has become the no surrender line. 
The Sacred Ground Camp had already existed for over a month with about 300 people camped out, but occupiers extended the camp on October 23 by creating three road blockades to prevent militarized law enforcement from entering. (This came just a day after police arrested roughly 127 water protectors [7] directly across the road from where private security for Energy Transfer had unleashed dogs [8] on activists one month earlier.) The camp also intended to halt construction where the remaining proposed pipeline route would connect with the Missouri River. 
Four days after declaring eminent domain for the camp, on October 27, law enforcement from seven states arrived there fully equipped with riot gear, all-terrain vehicles, armored vehicles and helicopters. They arrested 141 water protectors [9]‚Äîafter beating them with batons and issuing pepper spray. Law enforcement ultimately destroyed the camp, along with its tipis and sweat lodges. 
‚ÄúWe did everything in our power that we could do to defend our camp in a nonviolent approach,‚Äù says Cody Hall of the Cheyenne River Sioux Tribe. ‚ÄúBecause the only way to really defend it would have became a violent approach because you're meeting officers with a force of weaponry.‚Äù 
‚ÄúWe still honor those treaties, and I know the chairman has said that he expects America to do the same.‚Äù 
There are now talks of using the treaty to legally regain land rights to end the pipeline's construction, according to Hall and others on-site. There is a precedent for taking this approach: In May, the Lummi in Washington state called on the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers to reject a coal terminal permit on the premise that it would harm Lummi fishing grounds, which the federal government is legally mandated to protect per an 1855 treaty. The Lummi won [10]. No terminal was built, fishing grounds were not harmed and the treaty was honored. 
‚Äú[DAPL] brings to the surface all the issues dealing with treaties,"" says Bald Eagle. ""It brings up all the wrongdoings that have been happening in the past. The American government has repeatedly shoved all of their wrongdoings underneath the rug, and the issue with the Dakota Access Pipeline has pulled that rug off, and now we have to look at everything that‚Äôs been done wrong.‚Äù 
He lays out three choices for the U.S. government: correct its wrongs, put the rug back or commit another wrong. 
President Barack Obama [11], when interviewed by social media news site NowThis, stated that the Corps is figuring out [12] how to reroute the pipeline over the next several weeks, saying, ""There is a way for us to accommodate sacred lands of Native Americans."" But construction has nearly reached the Missouri River, sacred water for the Sioux. Several more weeks may be too late. Yessenia Funes is the climate justice reporter for Colorlines.

What the Clintons Did to Haiti,"Tweet Widget by Nathan J. Robinson 
Bill and Hillary Clinton‚Äôs role in the ‚Äúremaking‚Äù of Haiti after a devastating earthquake and foreign occupation is ‚Äúindefensible,‚Äù according to the author‚Äôs article, ‚ÄúSuperpredator: Bill Clinton‚Äôs Use and Abuse of Black America,‚Äù from which this piece is excerpted. ‚ÄúMany Clinton projects ‚Äúhave primarily benefited wealthy foreigners and the island‚Äôs ruling elite.‚Äù Other projects simply fizzled. ‚ÄúThe money donated and invested was extraordinary, but nobody seems to know where it has gone.‚Äù What the Clintons Did to Haiti by Nathan J. Robinson 
This article previously appeared in Global Research and Current Affairs . 
‚ÄúShe intended to ‚Äòmake Haiti the proving ground for her vision of American power.‚Äô‚Äù 
Bill and Hillary Clinton had long shared a personal interest in Haiti, dating back to the time of their honeymoon, part of which was spent in Port-au-Prince. In his autobiography, Bill says that his understanding of God and human nature were profoundly transformed when they witnessed a voodoo ceremony in which a woman bit the head off a live chicken. Hillary Clinton says the two of them ‚Äúfell in love‚Äù with Haiti and they had developed a ‚Äúdeep connection‚Äù to the country. So when Hillary Clinton became Secretary of State in 2009, she consciously made the redevelopment of Haiti one of her top priorities. The country, she announced, would be a laboratory where the United States could ‚Äúroad-test new approaches to development,‚Äù taking advantage of what she termed ‚Äúthe power of proximity.‚Äù She intended to ‚Äúmake Haiti the proving ground for her vision of American power.‚Äù Hillary Clinton selected her own chief of staff, Cheryl Mills, to run the Haiti project. 
Mills would be joined by Bill Clinton, who had been deputized by the U.N. as a ‚Äúspecial envoy‚Äù to Haiti. Bill‚Äôs role was not well-defined, and Haitians were curious about what was in store. Mills wrote in an email to Hillary Clinton that Haitians saw Bill‚Äôs appointment as ‚Äúa step toward putting Haiti in a protectorate or trusteeship status.‚Äù Soon, ‚Äújoking that he must be coming back to lead a new colonial regime,‚Äù the Haitian media ‚Äú dubbed him Le Gouverneur.‚Äù 
The project was heavily focused on increasing Haiti‚Äôs appeal to foreign corporations. As Politico reported , Clinton‚Äôs experiment ‚Äúhad business at its center: Aid would be replaced by investment, the growth of which would in turn benefit the United States.‚Äù 
‚ÄúClinton announced that Haiti would be a laboratory where the United States could road-test new approaches to development, taking advantage of ‚Äòthe power of proximity.‚Äô‚Äù 
One of the first acts in the new ‚Äúbusiness-centered‚Äù Haiti policy involved suppressing Haiti‚Äôs minimum wage. A 2009 Haitian law raised the minimum wage to 61 cents an hour, from 24 cents an hour previously. Haitian garment manufacturers, including contractors for Hanes and Levi Strauss, were furious, insisting that they were only willing to agree to a seven-cent increase. The manufacturers approached the U.S. State Department, who brought intense pressure to bear against Haitian President Ren√© Pr√©val, working to ‚Äúaggressively block‚Äù the 37-cent increase. The U.S. Deputy Mission Chief said a minimum-wage increase ‚Äúdid not take economic reality into account‚Äù and simply ‚Äúappealed to the unemployed and underpaid masses.‚Äù But as Ryan Chittum of the Columbia Journalism Review explained , the proposed wage increase would have been only the most trivial additional expense for the American garment manufacturers: 
‚ÄúAs of last year Hanes had 3,200 Haitians making t-shirts for it. Paying each of them two bucks a day more would cost it about $1.6 million a year. Hanesbrands Incorporated made $211 million on $4.3 billion in sales last year, and presumably it would pass on at least some of its higher labor costs to consumers. Or better yet, Hanesbrands CEO Richard Noll could forego some of his rich compensation package. He could pay for the raises for those 3,200 t-shirt makers with just one-sixth of the $10 million in salary and bonus he raked in last year.‚Äù 
‚ÄúU.S. Deputy Mission Chief said a minimum-wage increase ‚Äòdid not take economic reality into account‚Äù and simply ‚Äòappealed to the unemployed and underpaid masses.‚Äô‚Äù 
The truth of the ‚Äúeconomic reality‚Äù was that the Haitian undergarment sector was hardly likely to become wildly less competitive as a result of the increase. The effort to suppress the minimum wage was not solely a Clinton project. It was also a ‚Äúconcerted effort on the part of Haitian elites, factory owners, free trade proponents, U.S. politicians, economists, and American companies.‚Äù But it was in keeping with the State Department‚Äôs priorities under Clinton, which prioritized creating a favorable business climate. It was that same familiar Clinton move ‚Äúfrom aid to trade.‚Äù Bill Clinton‚Äôs program for Haitian development, designed by Oxford University economist Paul Collier, ‚Äú had garment exports at its center.‚Äù Collier wrote that because of ‚Äúpropitious‚Äù factors like ‚Äúpoverty and [a] relatively unregulated labor market, Haiti has labor costs that are fully competitive with China.‚Äù But the Clintons‚Äô role in Haiti would soon expand even further. In 2010, the country was struck by the worst earthquake in its history. The disaster killed 160,000 people and displaced over 1.5 million more. (The consequences of the earthquake were exacerbated by the ruined state of the Haitian food economy, plus the concentration of unemployed Haitian farmers in Port-au-Prince.) Bill Clinton was soon put in charge of the U.S.-led recovery effort. He was appointed to head the Interim Haiti Recovery Commission (IHRC), which would oversee a wide range of rebuilding projects. At President Obama‚Äôs request, Clinton and George W. Bush created the ‚ÄúClinton-Bush Haiti Fund,‚Äù and began aggressively fundraising around the world to support Haiti in the earthquake‚Äôs aftermath. (With Hillary Clinton as Secretary of State overseeing the efforts of USAID, the Clintons‚Äô importance to the recovery could not be overstated; Bill‚Äôs appointment meant that ‚Äúat every stage of Haiti‚Äôs reconstruction‚Äîfundraising, oversight and allocation‚Äîa Clinton was now involved.‚Äù 
Despite appearances, the Clinton-Bush fund was not focused on providing traditional relief. As they wrote , ‚Äú[w]hile other organizations in Haiti are using their resources to deliver immediate humanitarian aid, we are using our resources to focus on long-term development.‚Äù While the fund would advertise that ‚Äú100% of donations go directly to relief efforts,‚Äù Clinton and Bush adopted an expansive definition of ‚Äúrelief‚Äù efforts, treating luring foreign investment and jobs as a crucial part of earthquake recovery. On their website, they spoke proudly of what the New York Daily News characterized as a program of ‚Äúsupporting longterm programs to develop Haiti‚Äôs business class.‚Äù 
‚ÄúAt every stage of Haiti‚Äôs reconstruction‚Äîfundraising, oversight and allocation‚Äîa Clinton was now involved.‚Äù 
The strategy was an odd one. Port-au-Prince had been reduced to ruin, and Haitians were crowded into filthy tent cities, where many were dying of a cholera outbreak (which had itself been caused by the negligence of the United Nations). Whatever value building new garment factories may have had as a longterm economic plan, Haitians were faced with somewhat more pressing concerns like the basic provision of shelter and medicine, as well as the clearing of the thousands of tons of rubble that filled their streets. 
The Clinton-led recovery was a disaster. A year after the earthquake, a stinging report from Oxfam singled out Clinton‚Äôs IHRC as creating a ‚Äúquagmire of indecision and delay‚Äù that had made little progress toward successful earthquake recovery. Oxfam found that: 
‚Äú‚Ä¶less than half of the reconstruction aid promised by international donors has been disbursed. And while some of that money has been put toward temporary housing, almost none of the funds have been used for rubble removal.‚Äù 
Instead, the Clinton Foundation, IHRC, and State Department created what a Wall Street Journal writer called ‚Äúa mishmash of low quality, poorly thought-out development experiments and half-finished projects.‚Äù Haitian IHRC members lamented that the commission had produced ‚Äúa disparate bunch of approved projects. . . [that] do not address as a whole either the emergency situation or the recovery, let alone the development, of Haiti.‚Äù A 2013 investigation by the Government Accountability Office found that most money for the recovery was not being dispersed, and that the projects that were being worked on were plagued by delays and cost overruns. Many Clinton projects were extravagant public relations affairs that quickly fizzled. For example, The Washington Post reported that : 
‚Äú‚Ä¶[a] 2011 housing expo that cost more than $2 million, including $500,000 from the Clinton Foundation, was supposed to be a model for thousands of new units but instead has resulted in little more than a few dozen abandoned model homes occupied by squatters.‚Äù 
‚Äú A stinging report from Oxfam singled out Clinton‚Äôs IHRC as creating a ‚Äòquagmire of indecision and delay.‚Äô‚Äù 
Other Clinton ventures were seen as ‚Äúdisconnected from the realities of most people in the poorest country in the Western Hemisphere.‚Äù Politico reported that many Clinton projects ‚Äúhave primarily benefited wealthy foreigners and the island‚Äôs ruling elite, who needed little help to begin with.‚Äù For example, ‚Äúthe Clinton Bush Haiti Fund invested more than $2 million in the Royal Oasis Hotel, where a sleek suite with hardwood floors costs more than $200 a night and the shops sell $150 designer purses and $120 men‚Äôs dress shirts.‚Äù 
Predictably, the Royal Oasis didn‚Äôt do an especially roaring trade; The Washington Post reported that ‚Äú[o]ne recent afternoon, the hotel appeared largely empty, and with tourism hardly booming five years after the quake, locals fear it may be failing.‚Äù In a country with a 30-cent minimum wage, investing recovery dollars in a luxury hotel was not just offensive, but economically daft. Sometimes the recovery projects were accused not only of being pointless, but of being downright harmful. For instance, Bill Clinton had proudly announced that the Clinton Foundation would be funding the ‚Äúconstruction of emergency storm shelters in L√©og√¢ne.‚Äù But an investigation of the shelters that the Foundation had actually built found that they were ‚Äúshoddy and dangerous‚Äù and full of toxic mold. The Nation discovered , among other things, that the temperature in the shelters reached over 100 degrees, causing children to experience headaches and eye irritations (which may have been compounded by the mold), and that the trailers showed high levels of carcinogenic formaldehyde, linked to asthma and other lung diseases. The Clinton Foundation had subcontracted the building of the shelters to Clayton Homes, a firm that had already been sued in the United States by the Federal Emergency Management Administration (FEMA) for ‚Äúhaving provided formaldehyde-laced trailers to Hurricane Katrina victims.‚Äù (Clayton Homes was owned by Warren Buffett ‚Äôs Berkshire Hathaway, and Buffett had been a longstanding major donor to the Clinton Foundation.) The Nation ‚Äôs investigation reported on children whose classes were being held in Clinton Foundation trailers. Their semester had just been cut short, and the students sent home, because the temperature in the classrooms had grown unbearable. The misery of the students in the Clinton trailers was described: 
‚ÄúJudith Seide, a student in Lubert‚Äôs sixth-grade class [explained that] she and her classmates regularly suffer from painful headaches in their new Clinton Foundation classroom. Every day, she said, her ‚Äòhead hurts and I feel it spinning and have to stop moving, otherwise I‚Äôd fall.‚Äô Her vision goes dark, as is the case with her classmate Judel, who sometimes can‚Äôt open his eyes because, said Seide, ‚Äòhe‚Äôs allergic to the heat.‚Äô Their teacher regularly relocates the class outside into the shade of the trailer because the swelter inside is insufferable. Sitting in the sixth-grade classroom, student Mondialie Cineas, who dreams of becoming a nurse, said that three times a week the teacher gives her and her classmates painkillers so that they can make it through the school day. ‚ÄòAt noon, the class gets so hot, kids get headaches,‚Äô the 12-year-old said, wiping beads of sweat from her brow. She is worried because ‚Äòthe kids feel sick, can‚Äôt work, can‚Äôt advance to succeed.‚Äô‚Äù 
‚ÄúThree times a week the teacher gives her and her classmates painkillers so that they can make it through the school day.‚Äù 
The most notorious post-earthquake development project, however, was the Caracol industrial park . The park was pitched as a major job creator, part of the goal of helping Haiti ‚Äúbuild back better‚Äù than it was before. The State Department touted the prospect of 100,000 new jobs for Haitians, with Hillary Clinton promising 65,000 jobs within five years. The industrial park followed the Clintons‚Äô preexisting development model for Haiti: public/private partnerships with a heavy emphasis on the garment industry. Even though there were still hundreds of thousands of evacuees living in tents, the project was based on ‚Äúthe more expansive view that, in a desperately poor country where traditional foreign aid has chronically failed, fostering economic development is as important as replacing what fell down.‚Äù Much of the planning was focused on trying to lure a South Korean clothing manufacturer to set up shop there, by plying them with U.S. taxpayer funding. The Caracol project was ‚Äúthe centerpiece‚Äù of the U.S.‚Äôs recovery effort. A gala celebrating its opening featured the Clintons and Sean Penn, and it was treated as the emblem of the new, ‚Äúbetter‚Äù Haiti, that would demonstrate the country‚Äôs commitment to being ‚Äúopen for business.‚Äù In order to build the park, hundreds of poor farmers were evicted from their land, so that millions of dollars could be spent transforming it. 
But the project was a terrible disappointment. After four years, it was only operating at 10% capacity , and the jobs had failed to materialize : 
Far from 100,000 jobs‚Äîor even the 60,000 promised within five years of the park‚Äôs opening‚Äî ‚ÄúCaracol currently employs just 5,479 people full time. That comes out to roughly $55,000 in investment per job created so far; or, to put it another way, about 30 times more per job than the average [Caracol] worker makes per year. The park, built on the site of a former U.S. Marine-run slave labor camp during the 1915-1934 U.S. occupation, has the best-paved roads and manicured sidewalks in the country, but most of the land remains vacant.‚Äù 
Most of the seized farmland went unused, then, and even for the remaining farmers, ‚Äú surges of wastewater have caused floods and spoiled crops.‚Äù Huge queues of unemployed Haitians stood daily in front of the factory, awaiting jobs that did not exist. The Washington Post described the scene: 
‚ÄúEach morning, crowds line up outside the park‚Äôs big front gate, which is guarded by four men in crisp khaki uniforms carrying shotguns. They wait in a sliver of shade next to a cinder-block wall, many holding r√©sum√©s in envelopes. Most said they have been coming every day for months, waiting for jobs that pay about $5 a day. From his envelope, Jean Mito Palvetus, 27, pulled out a diploma attesting that he had completed 200 hours of training with the U.S. Agency for International Development on an industrial sewing machine. ‚ÄòI have three kids and a wife, and I can‚Äôt support them,‚Äô he said, sweating in the hot morning sun. ‚ÄòI have a diploma, but I still can‚Äôt get a job here. I still have nothing.‚Äô‚Äù 
‚Äú The interests of the market, the interest of foreigners are prioritized over the majority of people who are impoverished in Haiti.‚Äù 
For some , the Caracol project perfectly symbolized the Clinton approach: big promises, an emphasis on sweatshops, incompetent management, and little concern for the actual impact on Haitians. ‚ÄúCaracol is a prime example of bad help,‚Äù as one Haiti scholar put it . ‚ÄúThe interests of the market, the interest of foreigners are prioritized over the majority of people who are impoverished in Haiti.‚Äù 
But, failure as it may have been, the Caracol factory was among the more successful of the projects, insofar as it actually came into existence. A large amount of the money raised by Bill Clinton after the earthquake, and pledged by the U.S. under Hillary Clinton, simply disappeared without a trace, its whereabouts unknown. As Politico explained : 
‚ÄúEven Bill‚Äôs U.N. Office of the Special Envoy couldn‚Äôt track where all of [it] went‚Äîand the truth is that still today no one really knows how much money was spent ‚Äòrebuilding‚Äô Haiti. Many initial pledges never materialized. A whopping $465 million of the relief money went through the Pentagon, which spent it on deployment of U.S. troops‚Äî20,000 at the high water mark, many of whom never set foot on Haitian soil. That money included fuel for ships and planes, helicopter repairs and inscrutables such as an $18,000 contract for a jungle gym‚Ä¶ Huge contracts were doled out to the usual array of major contractors, including a $16.7 million logistics contract whose partners included Agility Public Warehousing KSC, a Kuwaiti firm that was supposed to have been blacklisted from doing business with Washington after a 2009 indictment alleging a conspiracy to defraud the U.S. government during the Iraq War.‚Äù 
The recovery under the Clintons became notorious for its mismanagement. Clinton staffers ‚Äú had no idea what Haiti was like and had no sensitivity to the Haitians.‚Äù They were reportedly rude and condescending toward Haitians, even refusing to admit Haitian government ministers to meetings about recovery plans. While the Clintons called in high-profile consulting firms like McKinsey to draw up plans, they had little interest in listening to Haitians themselves. The former Haitian prime minister spoke of a ‚Äúweak‚Äù American staff who were ‚Äúmore interested in supporting Clinton than helping Haiti.‚Äù 
‚ÄúA large amount of the money raised by Bill Clinton after the earthquake, and pledged by the U.S. under Hillary Clinton, simply disappeared without a trace, its whereabouts unknown.‚Äù 
One of those shocked by the failure of the recovery effort was Chelsea Clinton, who wrote a detailed email to her parents in which she said that while Haitians were trying to help themselves, every part of the international aid effort, both governmental and nongovernmental, was falling short. ‚ÄúThe incompetence is mind numbing,‚Äù she wrote . Chelsea produced a detailed memorandum recommending drastic steps that needed to be taken in order to get the recovery on track. But the memo was kept within the Clinton family, released only later under a Freedom of Information Act disclosure of Hillary‚Äôs State Department correspondence. If it had come out at the time, as Haiti journalist Jonathan Katz writes , it ‚Äúwould have obliterated the public narrative of helpful outsiders saving grateful earthquake survivors that her mother‚Äôs State Department was working so hard to promote.‚Äù 
The Clintons‚Äô Haiti recovery ended with a whimper. The Clinton-Bush Haiti Fund distributed the last of its funds in 2012 and disbanded, without any attempt at further fundraising. The IHRC ‚Äú quietly closed their doors‚Äù in October of 2011, even though little progress had been made. As the Boston Review ‚Äôs Jake Johnston explained , though hundreds of thousands remained displaced, the IHRC wiped its hands of the housing situation: 
‚Äú[L]ittle remained of the grand plans to build thousands of new homes. Instead, those left homeless would be given a small, one-time rental subsidy of about $500. These subsidies, funded by a number of different aid agencies, were meant to give private companies the incentive to invest in building houses. As efforts to rebuild whole neighborhoods faltered, the rental subsidies turned Haitians into consumers, and the housing problem was handed over to the private sector.‚Äù 
The Clintons themselves simply stopped speaking about Haiti. After the first two years, they were ‚Äúnowhere to be seen‚Äù there, despite Hillary‚Äôs having promised that her commitment to Haiti would long outlast her tenure as Secretary of State. Haiti has been given little attention during Hillary Clinton‚Äôs presidential campaign, even though the Haiti project was ostensibly one of great pride for both Clintons. 
‚ÄúOne of those shocked by the failure of the recovery effort was Chelsea Clinton.‚Äù 
The widespread consensus among observers is that the Haiti recovery, which TIME called the U.S.‚Äôs ‚Äúcompassionate invasion,‚Äù was a catastrophically mismanaged disappointment. Jonathan Katz writes that ‚Äúit‚Äôs hard to find anyone these days who looks back on the U.S.-led response to the January 12, 2010, Haiti earthquake as a success.‚Äù While plenty of money was channeled into the country, it largely went to what were ‚Äúlittle more than small pilot projects‚Äîa new set of basketball hoops and a model elementary school here, a functioning factory there.‚Äù 
The end result has been that little has changed for Haiti. ‚ÄúHaitians find themselves in a social and economic situation that is worse than before the earthquake,‚Äù reports a Belgian photojournalist who has spent 10 years in Haiti: 
‚ÄúEveryone says that they‚Äôre living in worse conditions than before‚Ä¶ When you look at the history of humanitarian relief, there‚Äôs never been a situation when such a small country has been the target of such a massive influx of money and assistance in such a short span of time‚Ä¶ On paper, with that much money in a territory the size of Haiti, we should have witnessed miracles; there should have been results.‚Äù 
‚ÄúIf anything, they appear worse off,‚Äù says Foreign Policy of Haiti‚Äôs farmers. ‚ÄúI really cannot understand how you could raise so much money, put a former U.S. president in charge, and get this outcome,‚Äù said one Haitian official. Indeed, the money donated and invested was extraordinary. But nobody seems to know where it has gone. 
Haitians direct much of the blame toward the Clintons. As a former Haitian government official who worked on the recovery said , ‚Äú[t]here is a lot of resentment about Clinton here. People have not seen results. . .. They say that Clinton used Haiti.‚Äù Haitians ‚Äú increasingly complain that Clinton-backed projects have often helped the country‚Äôs elite and international business investors more than they have helped poor ‚ÄòHaitians.‚Äù There is a ‚Äúsuspicion that their motives are more to make a profit in Haiti than to help it.‚Äù And that while ‚Äústriking a populist pose, in practice they were attracted to power in Haiti.‚Äù 
But perhaps we should be more forgiving of the Clintons‚Äô conduct during the Haitian recovery. After all, instead of doing true harm, the Clintons simply failed to do much good. And perhaps it‚Äôs better to have a luxury hotel than not to have one, better to have a few jobs than none at all. Thanks to Bill Clinton, there‚Äôs a gleaming new industrial park, albeit one operating at a fraction of its capacity. 
Yet it‚Äôs a mistake to measure Clinton against what would have happened if the United States had done nothing at all for Haiti. The question is what would have happened if a capable, nonfamous administrator, rather than a globetrotting narcissist, had been placed in charge. Tens of millions of dollars were donated toward the Haiti recovery by people across the world; it was an incredible outpouring of generosity. The squandering of that money on half-baked development schemes (mainly led by cronies ), and the ignoring of Haitians‚Äô own demands, mean that Clinton may have caused considerable harm through his failure. Plenty of people died in tent cities that would not have died if the world‚Äôs donations had been used effectively. 
‚ÄúDefending the Clintons‚Äô Haiti record is an impossible endeavor.‚Äù 
Democrats have bristled at recent attempts by Donald Trump to criticize Hillary Clinton over her record in Haiti. Jonathan Katz, whose in-depth reporting from Haiti was stingingly critical of the Clintons, has now changed his tune , insisting that we all bear the responsibility for the failed recovery effort. When Trump accused the Clintons of squandering millions building ‚Äúa sweatshop‚Äù in Haiti in the form of the Caracol park, media fact-checkers quickly insisted he was spewing Pinocchios. The Washington Post said that while Clinton Foundation donors may have financially benefited from the factory-building project, they benefited ‚Äúwrit large‚Äù rather than ‚Äúdirectly.‚Äù The Post cited the words of the factory‚Äôs spokesman as evidence that the factory was not a sweatshop, and pointed out that Caracol workers earned at least ‚Äúminimum wage‚Äù (failing to mention that minimum wage in Haiti remains well under a dollar). PolitiFact also rated the sweatshop claim ‚Äúmostly false,‚Äù even though Katz notes ‚Äúlong hours, tough conditions, and low pay‚Äù at the factory and PolitiFact acknowledges the ‚Äúongoing theft of legally-earned wages.‚Äù 
Defending the Clintons‚Äô Haiti record is an impossible endeavor, one Democrats should probably not bother attempting. As the Center for Economic and Policy Research, which has studied the recovery, noted , when it comes to the Clinton-led recovery mission, ‚Äúit‚Äôs hard to say it‚Äôs been anything other than a failure.‚Äù Haitians are not delusional in their resentment of the Clintons; they have good reason to feel as if they were used for publicity, and discarded by the Clintons when they became inconvenient. 
None of this means that one should vote for Donald Trump for president. His tears for Haiti are those of a highly opportunistic crocodile, and his interest in the country‚Äôs wellbeing began at the precise moment that it could be used a bludgeon with which to beat his political opponent. As we have previously noted in this publication , one does not need to be convinced that Hillary Clinton is an honorable person in order to be convinced that she is the preferable candidate. It is important, however, not to maintain any illusions, not to stifle or massage the truth in the service of short-term electoral concerns. It remains simultaneously true that a Clinton presidency is our present least-worst option and that what the Clintons did to Haiti was callous, selfish, and indefensible.",1
War Less Imminent After Clinton Defeat,"2016 presidential campaign A Black Agenda Radio commentary by executive editor Glen Ford 
Are most Americans warlike, or are they just easily misled into going along with the War Party that dominates both halves of the duopoly? In a certain sense, the distinction doesn‚Äôt matter. Most American don‚Äôt care enough about the lives of the millions of victims of U.S. empire to do much of anything to save them. And, if they voted for Hillary Clinton, they did not even have the presence of mind to save themselves from nuclear annihilation. War Less Imminent After Clinton Defeat A Black Agenda Radio commentary by executive editor Glen Ford 
‚ÄúTrump says he wants to cooperate with the Syrians and the Russians to defeat ISIS.‚Äù 
With so many people who call themselves liberals and leftists tearing their hair out in dread of a President Donald Trump, it is necessary to point out that the prospects of avoiding nuclear war are much better than they were the day before the election. Hillary Clinton was committed to imposing a ‚Äúno fly zone‚Äù over Syria that would have meant instant war with Russia, likely resulting in the annihilation of the human species. You‚Äôd think that would have made Clinton anathema to decent people. But Americans, including those who call themselves liberals, are not decent people ‚Äì not really. Based on their political behavior, they just pretend to be decent, but support U.S. governments that have slaughtered millions since the end of World War Two. If you voted for Obama and Clinton, you gave your assent to continuing George Bush‚Äôs wars, allowing Obama to start two major wars of his own, in Libya and Syria, and to Hillary Clinton‚Äôs plans to roll the nuclear dice on the fate of humanity. The whole world knows that Americans are dangerous, to themselves and to others. But, decent? Since when, and to whom? 
Donald Trump looks and talks like the ugly, racist, bullying American -- and he is exactly that, but he hasn‚Äôt killed anybody yet, and his public statements have been of a far more peaceful nature than the woman he beat at the polls. Trump says he wants to cooperate with the Syrians and the Russians to defeat ISIS. Trump also does not make distinctions between the various Islamic jihadist groups in Syria, unlike the Obama administration, which has directly and indirectly armed and funded all of the jihadist groups, and has spent much of the last several months trying to protect the al Nusra Front, the al Qaida affiliate in eastern Aleppo, from Russian bombing. 
‚ÄúThe jihadists are in despair, and the prospects for driving them out of Aleppo look promising.‚Äù 
No sooner had the votes been counted, than President Obama ordered U.S. Special Forces to go all-out to kill the leadership of al-Nusra. 
This war has been entirely based on lies, so Obama will probably limit his Kill List to al Qaida leaders, while sparing the rank and file jihadist fighters for future use by the United States. But it is safe to say that, had Hillary Clinton been elected, the most warlike factions in the U.S. military, the CIA, the State Department, and the foreign policy establishment at-large would be setting the stage for full-scale confrontation with Russia and all of Syria‚Äôs allies under President Clinton. Instead, the jihadists are in despair, and the prospects for driving them out of Aleppo look promising. Hopefully, the Syrian government and its friends will be on the road to victory before Donald Trump‚Äôs presidency is decisively captured by the bipartisan War Party that runs the empire. 
Syrian President Bashar Assad says it‚Äôs fine with him if Trump wants to fight the terrorists. But, Assad isn‚Äôt sure that Trump can deliver on his campaign pledge. ‚ÄúWhat about the countervailing forces within the administration, the mainstream media that were against him?‚Äù Assad asks . Assad thinks the notion of Trump bucking the War Party is ‚Äúdubious.‚Äù He‚Äôs right. Half a million Syrians are dead because most Americans don‚Äôt much care who their government kills, as long as they‚Äôre not white. But, getting rid of Clinton has slowed the War Party down a bit, and maybe prevented a nuclear war. If you are a decent person, you should be pleased about that.

Federal Judge Orders Water Delivery to Flint Residents,"Tweet Widget by BAR editor and columnist Dr. Marsha Adebayo 
Lead kills brain cells, but it took a federal judge to order that households in Flint, Michigan, be delivered four cases of bottled water to prevent further damage to their health. Meanwhile, the perpetrators of the mass poisoning ‚Äúwere rewarded with blanket immunity and protection by the State.‚Äù One wonders, ‚ÄúHow different the reaction of the Obama administration would have been had ISIS claimed responsibility for poisoning Flint?‚Äù Federal Judge Orders Water Delivery to Flint Residents by BAR editor and columnist Dr. Marsha Adebayo 
‚Äú The Flint water crisis is the pathway for future genocidal acts against Africans in America just as the Tuskegee experiment was the pathway to Flint.‚Äù 
For nearly one year, EPA and state officials (and presumably the president) knew, according to Congressional testimony, that residents of Flint, Michigan, were drinking, bathing, washing dishes in lead-poisoned water, and providing formula laced with poisoned water to infants. There is little hope for Flint‚Äôs predominantly black children who have ingested, and absorbed dangerous levels of lead. The poisoning of Flint‚Äôs water supply was simply the latest act of domestic terrorism towards Africans in America. 
But, the horror of the Flint water crisis has not stopped. What has stopped is the corporate media coverage of the carnage. This week, a federal judge, David Lawson, ruled that residents of Flint who continue to face lead contamination of their water supply are entitled to delivery of free bottled water to their homes. State officials must deliver each week four cases of bottled water to Flint households that don‚Äôt have ‚Äúproperly installed taps.‚Äù This ruling, while important, clearly falls short of the dignity and respect Flint residents deserve. In fact, the State of Michigan, without remorse or shame, has argued against such provisions. 
‚ÄúIf the residents of Flint were considered fully human or valued citizens why should they have to fight for the provision of clean water?‚Äù 
Flint residents have complained that the approximate $234 million that has been committed by the state of Michigan is inadequate to replace lead service lines, provide additional healthcare, clean water and water filters. Victims of this crisis have voiced concern that phone lines to arrange for water delivery and staffing at water stations have proved insufficient to meet the needs of the community. In addition, the State reduced service hours and eliminated service at water supply stations altogether on Sundays. One resident complained: 
‚ÄúMost of the people who‚Äôve called [the phone service] never had people come out. It‚Äôs just not staffed.‚Äù 
The State has argued that water delivery to qualifying households is an additional unnecessary expense costing $9 million. It was this same kind of argument that led the City Manager appointed by Michigan Governor Rick Snyder in April, 2014, to switch the city‚Äôs water supply to the polluted Flint River and then failed to require the city, because of financial considerations, to use corrosion controls to prevent lead from leaching off water pipes to private homes. If the residents of Flint were considered fully human or valued citizens why should they have to fight for the provision of clean water? As humans and citizens this is their right! The State has shown, once again, that Black lives do not matter in Flint and that residents will have to fight for life-sustaining water. 
The poisoning of Flint water should be considered an act of terror and should have been prosecuted under US terrorism laws and all involved indicted for domestic terror. But not one senior EPA or state official was fired or indicted -- criminal blame was reserved for low-level technicians. The poisoning was never treated as an ‚Äúemergency‚Äù situation. In fact, until residents of Flint started to protest, federal and state officials were content to allow the poisoning to continue. 
‚ÄúVictims of this crisis have voiced concern that phone lines to arrange for water delivery and staffing at water stations have proved insufficient to meet the needs of the community.‚Äù 
What this crisis has clearly exposed is that Flint was a deliberate poisoning of a low-income Black community. The perpetrators of this terrorist act were rewarded with blanket immunity and protection by the State. The EPA Administrator and Governor of Michigan will soon reap the benefits of being ‚Äúgood Germans‚Äù as they leave public service for lucrative private sector positions. 

It took President Obama nearly two years to travel to Flint for what was promoted as a ‚Äúbriefing.‚Äù How different the reaction of the Obama administration would have been had ISIS claimed responsibility for poisoning Flint. 
The EPA had the power to issue a cease and desist order against the State of Michigan under the Safe Drinking Water Act (SDWA Section 1431) that allows the EPA to seize control of State‚Äôs water system: 
‚Äú‚Ä¶ Upon receipt of information that a contaminant that is present in or likely to enter a public water system or an underground source of drinking water ‚Ä¶ that may present an imminent and substantial endangerment to the health of persons, the EPA administrator may take any action she deems necessary to protect human health.‚Äù 
According to congressional testimony by EPA Administrator Gina McCarthy, the EPA‚Äôs paltry excuse for not invoking congressionally mandated emergency powers was that they wanted to allow Michigan State agencies enough time to settle this matter. In the interim, women suffered miscarriages, Flint residents suffered strokes, and children developed neuro-toxic levels of lead poisoning that impact their intellectual and cognitive function. 
‚Äú The EPA Administrator and Governor of Michigan will soon reap the benefits of being ‚Äògood Germans‚Äô as they leave public service for lucrative private sector positions. ‚Äù 
Members of Congress called for the resignations of both the Michigan Governor and the EPA Administrator. While Obama did not have the power to unseat an elected Governor, he has the power to fire EPA Administrator Gina McCarthy who serves at the pleasure of the president. His decision was to leave McCarthy in place presumably because of the good job she performed in Flint. What is perhaps most revealing about the background story of the poisoning incident is that President Obama, by leaving McCarthy as head of the EPA, reaffirmed his faith in her abilities to carry out the mandate of his administration, including handling the more than over 300 additional water systems throughout the country, primarily in Black and low income communities, that indicate toxic levels of lead in the water. 
History will judge that the Flint water crisis is the pathway for future genocidal acts against Africans in America just as the Tuskegee experiment was the pathway to Flint. One should note that the Tuskegee experiment (1932-1972), conducted by the US Public Health Service, consisted initially of a sample size of 399 Black men. The Flint water poisoning ‚Äúexperiment‚Äù (starting in 2014) consisted of a city of nearly 100,000 residents. The escalation of organized violence, such as Tuskegee and Flint should trigger a mass movement to protect African life particularly as we contemplate policies of the Trump Administration.

System Breakdown: Trump's Chickens Come Home to Roost,"2016 presidential campaign by Danny Haiphong 
The crisis that has enveloped U.S. imperialism, under both Republican and Democratic rule, rocked the corporate duopoly system and opened the door for Donald Trump's ascension to power. Decades ago, ‚Äúthe Republicans became the White Man‚Äôs Party while the Democrats neutralized the left.‚Äù Trump is the result. ‚ÄúA genuine, radical left with any vision at all would not tremble before a Donald Trump Administration or mourn a Clinton loss.‚Äù System Breakdown: Trump's Chickens Come Home to Roost by Danny Haiphong 
‚ÄúThe left can no longer afford to suppress the material struggle for liberation in place of a rhetorical struggle against racism.‚Äù 
A number of people dropped their jaw in fear after Trump's victory in the 2016 elections. My jaw dropped for a different reason. Trump's victory occurred without the support of the ruling class. Most of his supporters came from the disaffected white working class and petit bourgeoisie (think ""small"" business). The Trump victory is thus a monumental moment in US history. The two-party corporate duopoly could not have drawn a worse hand and the ruling class has settled with Trump out of sheer limitation. US imperialism is in a state of system breakdown. The chickens have come home to roost. 
So how did Trump win? For one, Trump's legions were the only section of the voting age population energized to vote. As BAR's Bruce Dixon has noted , voter suppression has been a common practice in most states for decades. This combined with nearly four decades of capitalist crisis has placed the US political system in a dead-end situation. The Democratic Party has become the truest expression of the ruling capitalist class over this period. It instituted the trade deals, wars, austerity policies, and expanded the police and prison forces necessary to maintain the rule of capitalism in decline. The material conditions of the crisis these policies set into motion ultimately opened the door for Trump's chickens to come home to roost. 
‚ÄúUS imperialism is in a state of system breakdown.‚Äù 
Trump's base is on the move namely to resurrect more favorable economic conditions, historically distributed on a racial basis, of a prior stage of capitalism. War on behalf of industrial capital once distributed income and wealth more favorably to a larger portion of whites. Capitalist decline has forever changed these conditions. The Democratic Party and Republican Party are both responsible for the current conditions of depravity, racism, and neo-liberal psychosis that currently plagues US society. Starting in the 1970s, the Republicans became the White Man‚Äôs Party while the Democrats neutralized the left. Four decades of two-party misery greatly influenced the outcome of the 2016 elections. 
What is striking about Trump's base is how it was able to compel the Electoral College to betray the wishes of the ruling class. During the Democratic primary, delegates were more than happy to abandon popular will in favor of Clinton. But much has changed since the Democratic Party suppressed the Sanders campaign. WikiLeaks exposed the many crimes of Hillary Clinton. Although Clinton won the popular vote, many Black, Latino, union, and women voters decided not to opt for her as President. Those that did held their nose and were thus seen as less of a threat to the ruling class than the possibility of a dejected Trump base. 
‚Äú The Democratic Party and Republican Party are both responsible for the current conditions of depravity, racism, and neo-liberal psychosis that currently plagues US society.‚Äù 
The left in the US must come to terms with reality. It has spent decades trailing behind the crisis of imperialism by throwing its full support to the Democratic Party appendage of the ruling class. So-called white liberals in particular ridiculed the supposedly backward character of white workers and acted as if they possessed an anti-racist bone in their own bodies. The liberal-left as a whole bound themselves to the party of dead-end capitalism in order to avoid the party of the White Man. It was only a matter of time before the two-party corporate duopoly would rupture under the weight of its own contradictions. 
The Trump Administration is thus a logical conclusion of, and not a resolution to, the contradictions of imperialism. The left must now confront what it has avoided for too long. Never has it been clearer that Trump is the logical conclusion to the misery of life under US imperialism. The Democrats overplayed their hand, thinking that rhetoric alone could maintain its false image as the ""left"" wing of the two-party system. Yet even though the Democrats have consistently betrayed their base on behalf of the ruling class, millions of Clinton supporters are in a state of mourning over her loss. 
‚ÄúThe liberal-left as a whole bound themselves to the party of dead-end capitalism in order to avoid the party of the White Man.‚Äù 
A genuine, radical left with any vision at all would not tremble before the feet of a Donald Trump Administration or mourn a Clinton loss. The left must explore the many facets of the Trump development. It must no longer ignore the white workers and petty bourgeois Trump supporters that have brought real material demands to the fore. The left can no longer afford to suppress the material struggle for liberation in place of a rhetorical struggle against racism. The ruling class is in disarray and the Trump victory proves it. 
A Trump Presidency won't be a simple trip to the apocalypse. Even with a majority in the House and the Senate, the Republican Party must now choose to align itself to Trumpist politics or continue to collaborate with the Democratic Party to destroy him. There is no doubt that Wall Street, the military industrial complex, and the rest of the bourgeoisie will attempt to control the unpredictable white nationalist billionaire. The New York Times has already made overtures about a ""conflict of interest"" between his business investments and his newfound political position. Of course, the Times never had an issue with Obama when he bailed out Wall Street or chose his cabinet from a list provided by Citigroup. 
‚Äú The left must take advantage of the internal squabbling among the ruling class that is surely to come.‚Äù 
Trump is no Wall Street politician so he will inevitably face many contradictions while in office. Will he respect his base's wishes to build mutual ties with Russia and rollback NATO? Will he keep his promise to rid of NAFTA and the TPP? Or will he capitulate to the ruling class, angering his base and potentially setting up an early grave for his Administration? And what will the bourgeoisie do should they not be able to control him? All of these questions must be asked. The left must take advantage of the internal squabbling among the ruling class that is surely to come. Conditions remain favorable to organize a truly radical, left political agenda for social transformation. 
The ruling class will attempt to neutralize the left by controlling Trump‚Äôs agenda and simultaneously piecing together the Democratic Party for the 2020 elections. It remains to be seen whether this will effectively save the system from collapse. Because the truth is, Trump is not a reflection of some American apocalypse. His victory is a product of system breakdown. Over the next four years, it would serve the left well to defeat any possibility of a Democratic Party resurrection so a true party of the people can arise in this moment of opportunity. Liberals will mourn, but revolutionaries will fight. Danny Haiphong is an Asian activist and political analyst in the Boston area. He can be reached at [email protected]",1
Actually Existing Fascism,"Tweet Widget by Dolores Vek 
It appears that millions of folks that have tolerated -- and even cheered -- Barack Obama‚Äôs Kill Lists, assassinations of whole nations, and abject service to the ruling class, are suddenly panicking at the prospect of fascism. ‚ÄúSo where the fuck were all these protesters when Obama was actually doing what Trump says he‚Äôll do?‚Äù They fear the fascism of their imaginations, while oblivious to fascism in the real world. Actually Existing Fascism by Dolores Vek 
This article previously appeared on the author‚Äôs web site, Dolores Vek Cultural Marxism-Leninism . 
‚Äú Anyone who thinks Donald Trump is more of a fascist than Barack Obama is some combination of an imbecile, a liberal, and a charlatan.‚Äù 
With the election of Donald Trump, we‚Äôre being told that now is the time to fear fascism in America. 
What is this nightmare-vision of a fascist America supposed to look like? This alternate-reality USA, under the uniquely vicious reign of the Trump regime, is one in which minorities have to fear for their lives. The president will speak in openly white supremacist language. Black Americans will have to fear death at the hands of police and vigilantes; [email protected] will have to fear deportation; Muslims, Islamophobic violence; and so on. The good people of humanity will tremble as Trump wields America‚Äôs fearsome armed forces, secret police, elite death squads, drones, and surveillance technology for the good of himself and his cronies. Earth‚Äôs ecosystem‚Äîthe very promise of a habitable planet‚Äîwill be sacrificed by men who put profits ahead of human needs and the good of mankind. 
Truly, fascist America would a terrifying place. This vision is so terrifying that mere days after the election, even the most conformist liberals have suddenly gotten in touch with the radical antifa apparently slumbering inside each one of them. Highly publicized protests have already occurred in several major cities. Democratic Party propaganda organ Daily Kos , which banned criticisms of Hillary site-wide in March 2016, is suddenly receptive to a planned general strike on inauguration day. Those who can manage to unscrew themselves from the fetal position are resolute in their opposition to Trump‚Äôs agenda‚Äî‚Äú we have all been radicalized ,‚Äù writes future Molotov-thrower Lena Dunham. All these new radicals, radicalized by Trump‚Äôs racist language. Radicalized by the way his administration threatens non-whites with state violence. Radicalized by the fact that he‚Äôll be Commander-in-Chief, and he‚Äôll use that power to kill. 
‚ÄúDemocratic Party propaganda organ Daily Kos, which banned criticisms of Hillary site-wide in March 2016, is suddenly receptive to a planned general strike on inauguration day.‚Äù 
So where the fuck were all these protesters when Obama was actually doing what Trump says he‚Äôll do? Trump‚Äôs neo-Nazi dystopia is the USA that exists today, and anyone who doesn‚Äôt realize it needs to shut the fuck up and stop pretending to know anything about politics. Anyone who thinks Donald Trump is more of a fascist than Barack Obama is some combination of an imbecile, a liberal, and a charlatan. 
Barack Obama was the President who expanded the White House‚Äôs power to kill anyone, anywhere, including American citizens. If wielding power like a f√ºhrer is the mark of fascism, then Obama qualified as of the 2012 passage of the NDAA . 
It seems like every dire warning about the Trump administration starts with a bit about the millions of immigrant families that might be torn apart. Many Trump voters would salivate over the prospect of deporting 2.5 million people, as Obama has done‚Äîmore than every 20th century president combined. Along the way, the Obama administration has created countless millions of refugees by destroying Honduras and Libya, towards whom the president has shown a remarkable callousness that doesn‚Äôt seem to trouble these Democrats suddenly frightened on behalf of immigrants. 
Trump said that he wants to ban Muslims from entering the United States. In 2009, as Obama began his time in the White House, prosecutions for ‚Äúhomegrown terrorism‚Äù shot up, as the Obama Department of Justice focused on a Muslim enemy within. By 2010, in the face of nativist hysteria over a ‚ÄúGround Zero mosque,‚Äù the most stirring defense the President could muster was that Muslims were free to practice where they want but they probably shouldn‚Äôt . This was at the same time that the NYPD, trained and likely acting on behalf of the CIA, was spying on tens of thousands of Muslim-Americans throughout the US Northeast. Anyone deluded enough to think Barack Obama is a friend to Muslims should ask Tarek Mehanna, Abdulrahman al-Awlaki, or the hundreds of thousands of Libyans, Yemenis, Pakistanis, Afghans, Iraqis, Somalis, or Iranians who his administration has killed, displaced, maimed, starved, or terrorized. And with less than a week before the election, Barack Obama agreed to appear on HBO‚Äôs Real Time hosted by Bill Maher, a virulent liberal Islamophobe who has spent years peddling Trumpian bigotry against Muslims. 
‚ÄúThe Obama administration has created countless millions of refugees by destroying Honduras and Libya.‚Äù 
Liberals are horrified by Trump‚Äôs hatred of journalists, which is supposed to be a sign of his aberrant fascist tendencies. Before the Snowden leak spectacle largely wiped of from the news cycle, progressive outlets had started to cover the Obama administration‚Äôs war on journalism, which was sending whistleblowers and their journalist allies to prison at an unprecedented rate. Of course, while Trump‚Äôs dislike of journalists makes him Hitleresque , Obama‚Äôs actual imprisonment of journalists was, at worst, Nixonian . 
Trump will, apparently unlike every president in AmeriKKKan history, be uniquely bad for African-Americans. Will his administration steal the wealth from black homes, the way Obama helped Wall Street loot black America? Will black Americans have to rise up in the streets and declare that black lives matter, to protest the black person murdered every 28 hours in the USA? Will black revolutionaries start being mysteriously and brutally murdered in Trump‚Äôs America, like Darren Seals and at least 5 other activists in Ferguson, all of whom bear the hallmarks of falling victim to a COINTELPRO 2.0? Will a Trump Justice Department ramp-up efforts to capture fugitive black freedom fighters like Assata Shakur ? 
Even the idea that Trump and the Republicans are the only ones to speak in openly white supremacist language is idiotic, and someone doesn‚Äôt have to go back to Hillary Clinton talking about ‚Äúsuper-predators‚Äù to find examples. As one blog pointed out: 
Obama‚Äôs 2008 ‚Äúspeech on race‚Äù in Philadelphia (officially titled ‚ÄúA More Perfect Union‚Äù), celebrated as ‚Äútoo good for today‚Äôs media‚Äù and ‚Äúreviving the spirit of the nation itself,‚Äù was a Eucharistic repetition of white supremacist lies. In this speech, the future president delivered an objectively white supremacist view of US history, deriding the idea that white racism is endemic, equating the liberation theology of Jeremiah Wright with the latent anti-black racism of his grandmother, and accusing black radicals and revolutionary anti-racists of fomenting ‚Äúdisunity‚Äù at a time when ‚Äúwe‚Äù need to come together‚Äîwhile pointing to his own candidacy as proof that racism had mostly been dismantled. Minus the well-worn details about the Senator‚Äôs life story and tedious speechifying, the basic lessons of the speech would have been at home on a Fox News panel about ‚Äúrace hustlers.‚Äù 
One thing is true, though: Trump is uniquely bad in certain ways. The Donald, that two-bit reality-TV huckster, is sullying the august White House walls with his conciliatory attitude towards Russia and China (though his quick about-face on US troops in the southern half of the Korean peninsula is an indication of how serious this is). Still, after a year of Hillary Clinton sounding the drums of war, the Democrats are seemingly united in fury that Trump is a little frigid towards the idea of starting World War III. To be fair to them, they‚Äôre absolutely right: Trump can‚Äôt claim Hillary‚Äôs feverish desire for a nuclear war against Russia, nor her proven track record of killing millions of people throughout the global South. 
‚ÄúWhile Trump‚Äôs dislike of journalists makes him Hitleresque, Obama‚Äôs actual imprisonment of journalists was, at worst, Nixonian.‚Äù 
Anyone who hasn‚Äôt surrendered the last lobe of their brain to the Democratic Party, and who‚Äôs fond of not being turned into ashes, has to ask themselves why it would be desirable for President Trump to start WW3, as Clinton practically promised to do. This is another question that Nate Silver would get completely wrong, but I think the actually existing fascism of Obama offers a clue. Just like Democrats have transferred all of Obama‚Äôs evils to the Nazi caricature of Trump, liberals are the ones who are lashing out against reality. 
The reality is that capitalism, particularly at this stage, has nothing good to offer the vast majority of humanity, and even increasing numbers of people in the core. Democrats conveniently forget that the current occupant of 1600 Pennsylvania rose to power based on illusory promises to make things better. Like Trump, his record spoke to the absurdity of his bill of goods, and he boasted a CV only marginally more impressive than ‚Äúshady tycoon and TV personality.‚Äù Even though his economic promises were vague, all the ‚Äúhope‚Äù talk gave people a lot of ideas; when it came time to govern, Obama defended capital against ‚Äú the pitchforks ,‚Äù as he always intended. If apathetic voters and fucked-over workers played a part in Trump‚Äôs election, why wouldn‚Äôt they? And how will the upper-middle class and rich liberal who benefit from this order respond? As one commentator observed, in a story that is typical of America‚Äôs sneering liberal bourgeois: 
A Seattle-area friend who lives in the farther working-class suburbs came to work to his inner-city, wealthy liberal coworkers bitching that his neighbors ‚Äúvoted us into fascism.‚Äù In the same breath, this rich shit complained about the passing of a transportation bill that would raise their taxes: ‚ÄúIf they want Trump so bad they can pay for their own buses.‚Äù Here‚Äôs someone who probably calls themselves a progressive attacking actually existing progressivism because their taxes will go up a split hair, and potentially benefit unworthy types, ‚Äúdeplorables.‚Äù Maybe these people wouldn‚Äôt feel the need to ‚Äúshake things up‚Äù if they had had what they needed to thrive all along. But then your misty piney mossy caf√©-flanked Seattle townhome might have to fit only one Subaru in the garage. 
‚Äú Trump now owns whatever happens under his presidency,‚Äù writes another newly energized rebel at Daily Kos . Not Obama. Obama, like any high-status Democrat, is never responsible for what he creates, and when he is, it‚Äôs at worst a mistake. Actually existing fascism has been erected through a series of bumbles, hypocrisies, mistakes, and odd little ironies. Obama has never been culpable for what he does; today, Democrats wail that Hillary‚Äôs worse crime was being imperfect. The bourgeois elements that are the most visible Democrats can never own up to the fact that their alleged ‚Äúbase‚Äù doesn‚Äôt have any good reason to come out and vote for them. So like the Red State-bogeymen they invoke so frequently, liberals are sprinting away from reality into a bubble of comforting myths and idols. 
‚ÄúObama has never been culpable for what he does.‚Äù 
Rather than face up to the fact that Hillary Clinton has little appeal outside of Goldman Sachs and whatever the Project for a New American Century is called these days, Democrats are cursing Sanders fans, third-party voters, and non-voters with a hatred usually reserved for vegans. Since they can only imagine their own upper-middle class lives orbiting major urban centers, the loudest Democrats think that everyone who‚Äôs not exactly like them is a racist, woman-hating cretin, and hope ‚Äú that they be educated and moved to the vicinity of the major hubs in the northeast and western parts, that they die off [or] that a country would attack the United States and obliterate them.‚Äù Rather than actually learn anything of substance, liberals are doing the only thing their politics really involve: sharing and commiserating over an extremely circumscribed set of insipid pop-culture references that flatter them and insulate them from reality . Those leftist critiques of Obama or Clinton that do manage to penetrate this fantasy-world get angrily dismissed as right-wing media conspiracy theories or Kremlin propaganda. And finally, as with any good whitewash, liberals are going to pretend that Donald Trump represents something totally alien and uniquely menacing, as though Obama hasn‚Äôt done everything Trump says he will. 
‚ÄúWhen it came time to govern, Obama defended capital against ‚Äú the pitchforks ,‚Äù as he always intended.‚Äù 
And now, as soon as humanity has its first shot at finally being rid of the Clintons, and taking a small step back from the brink of ultimate atomic horror, these people want to gnash their teeth about America finally becoming fascist. 
Fuck them. 
If Trump is a fascist, them countless prominent American liberals are too, chief among them the widely beloved Barack Obama. Contemporary America doesn‚Äôt look like Nazi Germany for the simple reason that it isn‚Äôt Nazi Germany (J. Sakai argues that ‚Äú Settlerism filled the space that fascism normally occupies‚Äù). What the Democrats offer is a slightly more ‚Äúwoke fascism,‚Äù in which the slave-owning settlers are remade in entertainment media as cool black guys , with all the ‚Äúproblematic‚Äù racist history elided via a harmonious multi-ethnic makeover. It‚Äôs worth noting that Donald Trump makes overtures to the same woke fascism as Obama and Clinton: after the Pulse nightclub massacre, Trump promised to defend ‚Äú the LGBTQ community ‚Äù from foreign attackers. In other words, Trump and Clinton alike promise a typically colonialist defense of liberal values like gay rights from the swarthy hordes. 
So color me unim-fucking-pressed that now that a blatantly villainous Republican is headed for the White House, everyone is talking about a united front against fascism. Of course, given that the vast majority of the newly radicalized loved and still love the child-murdering white supremacist Barack Obama, what we‚Äôre talking about is a just another united front against the GOP. 
I know it‚Äôs ancient history to be talking about the Bush years, just like it‚Äôs hopelessly pass√© to unironically talk about ‚Äúimperialism‚Äù in 2016, but please indulge me. I remember back when George W. Bush was president, torturing people around the world, ‚Äúshredding the Constitution,‚Äù attacking Iraq and Afghanistan and threatening Iran with nukes. At the time, it was pretty common, even popular and fashionable, to call the president a fascist. Even on TV! Everyone who wasn‚Äôt a Republican was radical: it seemed like Democrats and communists alike could gripe over everything from a stolen Florida election to the invasion of Iraq. 
‚ÄúWhat the Democrats offer is a slightly more ‚Äòwoke fascism.‚Äô‚Äù 
Then sometime around 2007, a neoliberal and fundamentally conservative mediocrity named Barack Obama showed up, and while he made a lot of noise about how different he was, there was almost nothing of substance to back it up. Once he was president, all the stuff that was proof of George W.‚Äôs fascism became a trifling issue, a simple mistake, or a regrettable necessity when Obama did it. As Obama continued George Bush‚Äôs legacy, and as Dick Cheney came out in support of Hillary Clinton, liberals stopped thinking of the Bush administration as a fascist criminal enterprise and started seeing it through Sorkin-colored glasses, with a George Bush-Michelle Obama hug at the twilight of the Obama presidency marking the decisive transition. 
So I actually remember how this went down the last time the mainstream was this comfortable talking about fascism‚Äîalthough the chorus was never this deafening. I remember that all the liberals quieted down about fascism when their guy was doing it. So did a lot of the radicals, to the eternal shame and discredit of those absolute frauds. As the popular Democrat Obama brought hell to millions with the brazenness of a Duce , calling the president a fascist went back to the fringes, where it had been, and where it will be again once it‚Äôs no longer politically expedient for people at the top to have us raising hell against Trump. I know exactly how this goes, since it all happened before, and not very long ago, either. And just like with Obama, whose coronation was a sort of inversion of this, I remember that anyone who‚Äôs remotely skeptical of this obviously elite-approved narrative will get dismissed as a crank or a spoilsport. 
However, maybe for now we could have some perspective. I know he‚Äôs popular and cool, but Obama‚Äôs been in office nearly a full eight years. Maybe these last 70 days, the radicals now hyperventilating over Trump could develop some idea of what Obama‚Äôs actually been doing this entire time? 
And if the still-uncompromising black revolutionary and political prisoner Mumia Abu-Jamal can say ‚ÄúIf Trump is the price we have to pay to defeat Clintonian neoliberalism‚Äìso be it,‚Äù then maybe some of the liberals still dry-heaving can pull themselves together and learn a single thing about what America and the world are really like outside their privileged little bubbles? I mean, I know how fond these people are of pretending that they‚Äôre the only adults in the room, the only people using their inside voices. Maybe they could try to be as smart as Trevor Noah keeps telling them they are. 
‚ÄúMaybe these last 70 days, the radicals now hyperventilating over Trump could develop some idea of what Obama‚Äôs actually been doing this entire time?‚Äù 
In the meantime, I‚Äôll go ahead and be skeptical about all the no pasar√°n shit that cropped up the instant Hillary lost. Maybe if the inspiring new Credulous Dipshit Brigades could name a single fucking instance of fascism that‚Äôs not practiced by Obama, then this whole thing wouldn‚Äôt look like such an obviously astroturfed, color-revolutiony scam. 
What I know for sure is that any radicals who end up calling liberals comrade in the coming weeks are allying themselves with people who want a more violent, more genocidal , and ultimately more fascist president. Almost every liberal complaint includes references to Donald Trump weakening NATO , as though that wouldn‚Äôt be one of the most progressive developments for the good of humanity. This is where liberals give themselves away: just like they wanted Obama to restore America‚Äôs reputation after Bush so it could be the most effective fortress of capitalism, they trust Clinton to be a more capable imperial steward than Trump. If you find yourself shoulder-to-shoulder with liberals at the barricades, know that your allies are fighting on behalf of American fascism, if the word means what we keep hearing it does. 
And if you think Trump is more evil than Obama or Hillary Clinton, you‚Äôre ignorant as fuck and you‚Äôre a liberal. Dolores Vek can be contacted through her web site: https://doloresvek.wordpress.com",1
Social Justice Attorney Andrea Burton: Jailed for Refusing to Remove Black Lives Matter Lapel Pin,"Tweet Widget by Bill Quigley 
A young Black lawyer from Youngstown, Ohio, had to sue a judge who held her in contempt of court for wearing a Black Lives Matter pin. The judge said his decision had nothing to do with politics. ‚ÄúThe local NAACP chapter questioned that assertion and wondered whether the Judge would have jailed Burton if she was wearing a ‚ÄòSupport the Troops‚Äô pin.‚Äù Atty. Andrea Burton ultimately agreed to wear her pin in the courthouse, but not in the courtroom. Social Justice Attorney Andrea Burton: Jailed for Refusing to Remove Black Lives Matter Lapel Pin by Bill Quigley 
‚ÄúTo remain neutral becomes an accomplice to oppression.‚Äù 
Andrea Burton, a 30 year old Ohio criminal defense lawyer, was rocketed onto the national social justice scene this summer after she was handcuffed and jailed for refusing to take off a Black Lives Matter pin while in court. 
Burton‚Äôs stance received international attention . ‚ÄúI think that you can‚Äôt remain silent or you remain a party to oppression,‚Äù she told The Washington Post . ‚ÄúI am usually a pretty agreeable person. I‚Äôm always smiling. I‚Äôm polite. I have manners. But at some point it eats away at you how any time people see you talk about Black Lives Matter, then you‚Äôre being sensitive, you‚Äôre the person who‚Äôs racist.‚Äù In interviews with local media Burton insisted ‚ÄúI'm not anti-police, I work with law enforcement and I hold them in the highest regard, and just to say for the record, I do believe all lives matter. But at this point they don't all matter equally."" 
The Black Lives Matter pin was about one inch across , the size of a nickel . Burton refused an order to remove the Black Lives matter pin by Youngstown Ohio Judge Robert Milich . Burton told the Judge she was asserting her First Amendment rights . ‚ÄúI said I‚Äôm respecting my first amendment right, that I‚Äôm not neutral to injustice, and to remain neutral becomes an accomplice to oppression.‚Äù The judge held her in contempt of court, jailed her and sentenced her to five days. After being jailed for five hours and the NAACP was called in to help, the judge released Burton pending an appeal of his decision. 
Judge Milich, who was already famous for announcing his refusal to perform any marriages on the day the U.S. Supreme Court legalized same sex marriage, told the media that his own personal opinions had nothing to do with the decision. The local NAACP chapter questioned that assertion and wondered whether the Judge would have jailed Burton if she was wearing a ‚ÄúSupport the Troops‚Äù pin. When asked by The Daily Beast , whether he would jail a lawyer for wearing a pin that said Support Our Troops, he refused to say. ‚ÄúI can‚Äôt speculate on what a political pin might be until I look at it. I just used the definition in the Black‚Äôs Law Library Dictionary, and the standard dictionary of what‚Äôs political.‚Äù The Judge further muddied the waters when he said ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs a difference between a flag, a pin from your church or the Eagles and having a pin that‚Äôs on a political issue.‚Äù 
‚ÄúBurton told the Judge she was asserting her First Amendment rights.‚Äù 
Burton paid a high price for her convictions. After she was jailed, Burton, who had been previously regularly appointed to represent numerous Youngstown Municipal criminal defendants , said she was ‚Äúfrozen out‚Äù of the appointment process for representing criminal defendants and received no appointments at all. 
Burton then filed a federal civil rights damages actio n against Judge Milich, the other Youngstown Municipal Judge, and the City of Youngstown for violations of her constitutional rights to Freedom of Speech, Due Process and Equal Protection. In the civil rights case, filed in the Northern District of Ohio, Burton pointed out police officers were in the same courtroom with black tape over their badges and the judge did nothing to them. After court monitored settlement discussions, Burton agreed to drop her federal civil rights case. In return the Judge agreed to drop her contempt charge. Burton said she will continue to wear her BLM pin in the courthouse but not inside the courtroom. Further, the settlement provided that local judges agreed not to retaliate against her and will fully consider her requests for future appointments to court-appointed cases. 
Who is this brave lawyer? 
Beginnings 
Burton grew up in Youngstown, Ohio in a family active in the civil rights movement. ‚ÄúMy grandfather marched on Washington with Martin Luther King ,‚Äù said Burton. ‚ÄúHe was a good friend of A. Phillip Randolph . He protested in the South during the Civil Rights Movements and attended the 1963 March on Washington. He was one of the first black Councilpersons for Youngstown. My mother was pretty active in the black awakening during the 60s. She was fairly militant about civil rights as a teen and was what we know now as a feminist.‚Äù 
Some of her courage is no doubt due to her upbringing. Burton‚Äôs older brother was born with a rare genetic disorder that left him mentally disabled and very sickly as a child. Dad operated a successful business despite addiction issues until his death when Burton was 15. Mom, a legal secretary and later a court bailiff, did heroic work caring for the family. 
‚ÄúMy mother‚Äôs compassion and dedication greatly influenced how empathetic I have become. She pushed me greatly to do more than what was expected, to excel when it would be simpler to be typical. She never told me that there was anything I could not do if I set my sights on achieving it. She worked hard to make the resources available to me if I actually wanted them. Both my parents were college educated. Both were heavily invested in learning. 
‚ÄúMy parents never really treated me as a child so I was often exposed to difficult realties and frank conversations. I was conscious of the ways people were different (i.e., gender, orientation, race, or class) but how it did not matter at all in determining their worth.‚Äù 
Studies 
Burton always did well in school. ‚ÄúI was expected to be a good student. My father was relentless about math grades and performances especially. I won a sport in the Junior Statesman Program at Georgetown University to study government when I was 16 years old. It was a highly competitive program that included people from all over the world. 
Burton earned a scholarship and graduated from Youngstown State University in 2008 in pre-law and journalism. She was awarded another scholarship to study for her Masters in Library and Information Science at University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign . 
‚ÄúI decided to become a lawyer as I finished my bachelor‚Äôs degree.‚Äù So after she received her graduate degree she returned to Ohio and commuted from home to attend the University of Akron School of Law . ‚ÄúThe best part of law school was working in the legal clinic.‚Äù There she wrote appellate briefs for prisoners, provided legal research to inmates, handled applications for clemency to the governor and other pro bono services to low income individuals. She took social justice classes when she could and wrote a major paper on Kelley Williams-Bolar who was convicted of a felony for enrolling her children in another better school district. ‚ÄúI wanted to study why anyone would commit a felony to educate their kids, why was it necessary? What differences where there?‚Äù 
‚ÄúShe wrote appellate briefs for prisoners, provided legal research to inmates, handled applications for clemency.‚Äù 
After becoming a lawyer, Burton began a small private practice and spent a lot of her time working as a public defender. ‚ÄúIt was a shock,‚Äù Burton admits. ‚ÄúPeople with power and influence held some bigoted ideas. People were not treated fairly and it was quite disheartening. 
‚ÄúAs a criminal defense lawyer, I am motivated by humanity, compassion and the oath I took to uphold the Constitution of the United States. I am often asked how I could represent those accused of crimes, some heinous crimes. I see criminal defense work as an opportunity to make sure that the promise that the criminal justice system makes ‚Äúinnocent until proven guilty‚Äù is followed. Getting convictions and imparting justice are two very different things. My job is to make sure that statutes and rules are followed to guarantee a fair and impartial trial. Politics should not factor into that. I am merely an instrument of justice but I take my role extremely seriously. 
‚ÄúIt is sometimes challenging to work with other attorneys and people in the justice system who are oblivious to the discrepancies people of color and impoverished people experience within the system that is set up to eradicate those inequities. I am also disappointed in people who accept the status quo just because it is easy and convenient. We need to be willing to continually re-evaluate our role in furthering injustice. 
Justice 
‚ÄúJustice sometimes comes slowly, through time, by the changing of minds through understanding and experience. Other times it is the result of tumultuous uncertain revolutions. The problem with maintaining justice is that often we only recognize what justice is by seeing injustice. Sometimes the world needs a major event, a major catalyst to stir change. That process is often frightening. To me, living in a world where we value some more than others is unjust. Especially when some are undervalued to the point that people are systematically dying. When people are too afraid to have an informed dialogue about how factors intersect to create injustice that perpetuates injustice. Willful blindness in the face of a wealth of information is the greatest threat to civilization today. 
Sustainability 
‚ÄúOne of the ways I sustain myself is that I read continuously. I read philosophy as well as political and spiritual texts. I have a close friend that I speak with virtually every week. He has been a savior for me since I was 17 years old. We understand each other because we are both avid readers, with similar interests in philosophy and in that we both have always felt a sense of isolation and disconnection from our peers. This is important because I think that more and more people feel a sense of disconnect from the world despite the many connections created through social media. 
‚ÄúWhen someone asks me for a book recommendation, I suggest Strength to Love by Martin Luther King Jr. It is a religious book, but I do not read it simply for the Christian aspects of it. I read it because it‚Äôs empowering, powerful and because King was an extremely smart compassionate person and it shows. I also read Nietzsche religiously. 
‚ÄúI am involved in the YWCA which is dedicated to eliminating racism, empowering women and promoting peace, justice, freedom and dignity for all. 
‚ÄúMy dream is that differences in color would actually be as relevant as shoe size and that religious fanaticism would disappear.‚Äù 
Advice to Law Students 
‚ÄúLearn to see value in every human being and truly read the papers that are the foundation of this Country. Study and understand the Constitution and The Federalist Papers . They demonstrate how this democracy was formulated. Know your history because it shapes today in ways you will never appreciate fully otherwise. Be prepared to examine yourself for your own conflicts in logic and your own biases. Learn how lawyers can become accomplices to injustice, even if unintentionally. 
Role Models 
‚Äú Harriet Tubman , Sojourner Truth , Alexander Hamilton , W.E.B Du Bois , Langston Hughes , James Baldwin , Gandhi , Malala Yousafzai , Martin Luther King , A. Phillip Randolph , Rosa Parks , Thurgood Marshall , Ralph Abernathy , and Joseph Lowery inspire me. Malcolm X of course. And our President Barack Obama and the First Lady Michelle Obama . I am also inspired by the countless individuals who face oppression and injustice in their lives daily but continue to work toward a better world. I am inspired by those who fight for those who are limited in power or face nearly insurmountable odds. I think the work of those individuals is the key to making the world a place where love conquers hate and fear. 
Conclusion 
‚ÄúThe day I wore that button and was found in contempt changed my life, the effect of it are still rippling, some in destructive ways and others in very inspiring ways. I wore it because my soul was so tired from all the inequities I had seen over my 4 years of practice. I was exhausted from losing a series of small battles for understanding for my vulnerable clients. I was tired of the indifference of the prosecutorial offices. And all I could think to do was wear this button for a little joy. For a small win. To hope to change someone‚Äôs mind. Bill Quigley teaches law at Loyola University New Orleans.",1
One Treaty Could Change the Fight to Stop the Dakota Access Pipeline,"Tweet Widget by Yessenia Funes 
The fight against the Dakota Access Pipeline isn‚Äôt only about water rights and sacred sites; it‚Äôs also about the U.S. government‚Äôs historical refusal to honor treaties‚Äîwhen ‚Äúthey interfered with Manifest Destiny.‚Äù Washington violated its treaty with the Sioux in 1877, and later declared its power to void all Native treaties. ‚ÄúThere are now talks of using the treaty to legally regain land rights to end the pipeline's construction.‚Äù One Treaty Could Change the Fight to Stop the Dakota Access Pipeline by Yessenia Funes 
This article previously appeared in ColorLines and Portside . 
‚Äú Highway 1806 has become the no surrender line.‚Äù 
When activists talk about the controversial Dakota Access Pipeline [1] and the Native uprising surrounding its construction, they often frame it with regard to the environment. Water. Sacred burial grounds. Grandmother Earth. 
Opponents site potential environmental risks to water resources like the Missouri and Mississippi rivers to defend their stance against the 1,172-mile long pipeline, which would have the capacity to transport up to 570,000 barrels of crude oil a day from the Bakken oilfields of North Dakota to markets across the U.S. 
What many ignore, however, is another facet of the #NoDAPL [2] movement: Native sovereignty. 
Most of the confrontations between water protectors and law enforcement are occurring near the Standing Rock Reservation. The reservation currently takes up roughly 3,625 square miles [3] across southeastern North Dakota and into South Dakota. More than 8,000 people [4] live in scattered communities, all connected by a common history‚Äîone which includes land theft and treaty violations. 
The construction of the Dakota Access Pipeline has brought this history to the current day. ‚ÄúOur standoff is on treaty land, so we have every right to defend what is rightfully ours,‚Äù says Cody Hall, a Lakota civil rights activist with the Cheyenne River Tribe who has spent time on the frontlines in North Dakota. 
When he speaks of ‚Äútreaty land,‚Äù he‚Äôs referring to land allotted to the Great Sioux Nation by the Treaty of Fort Laramie of 1851 and 1868. 
‚ÄúOur standoff is on treaty land, so we have every right to defend what is rightfully ours.‚Äù 
The revised treaty established the Great Sioux Reservation in 1868, which the federal governement would eventually shrink to what became the Standing Rock Reservation. The treaty land crisscrossed between seven present-day states‚ÄîNorth Dakota, South Dakota, Nebraska, Kansas, Colorado, Wyoming and Montana‚Äîincluding the reservation and unceded territories reserved for hunting. 
These boundaries were created to ensure peace between Native people and colonizers. The temptations of gold, however, meant that travelers were soon in tribal territory. Almost immediately after its conception in 1851, the U.S. violated the treaty by not policing its citizens' entry onto Native land. 
For Native Americans, treaties function as the law of the land. Article VI of the U.S. Constitution clearly states: 
This Constitution, and the laws of the United States which shall be made in pursuance thereof; and all treaties made, or which shall be made, under the authority of the United States, shall be the supreme law of the land; and the judges in every state shall be bound thereby, anything in the Constitution or laws of any State to the contrary notwithstanding. 
The U.S. government would honor treaties‚Äîuntil they interfered with Manifest Destiny. ‚ÄúIt was all about colonial expansion,‚Äù says Frank Pommersheim, a professor at the University of South Dakota School of Law who specializes in Indian law. In 1877, without consent from the Sioux, the United States stole their sacred Black Hills. The land was the center of their world, their birthplace. 
This act set in stone U.S.-tribal relations. From then on, the United States slowly diminished the land it left for tribal peoples. By 1889, the Great Sioux Reservation became what it is today: 3,625 square miles tucked between North and South Dakota, stripped of ancestral burial grounds and lush buffalo populations with which the Sioux used to coexist. 
In 1903, fewer than 30 years after the Black Hills seizement, the Supreme Court ruled in Lone Wolf v. Hitchcock [5] that Congress may unilaterally break treaties between the U.S. and Native Americans using its plenary power. ‚ÄúIt is unfortunately a part of American law. That basic precept is totally unacceptable to Native people in the context of treaties,‚Äù Pommersheim explains. ""It is just a collision between cultures and different understandings and interpretation of what treaties actually mean."" 
‚ÄúAlmost immediately after its conception in 1851, the U.S. violated the treaty by not policing its citizens' entry onto Native land.‚Äù 
He is correct that a vast number of Native Americans find this unacceptable. 
‚ÄúTo us [these treaties] are very much still alive and a part of our everyday life,‚Äù says Remi Bald Eagle, the intergovernmental affairs coordinator for the Cheyenne River Sioux Tribe in South Dakota. ‚ÄúWe still honor those treaties, and I know the chairman has said that he expects America to do the same.‚Äù 
And while the U.S. has violated said treaties over the past century, it‚Äôs never declared the treaties null or void, Bald Eagle adds. 
With the Treaty of Fort Laramie in mind, water protectors opposing the Dakota Access Pipeline have tried to take action. On October 23, pipeline opponents declared eminent domain [6] over land owned by Energy Transfer, the company behind the pipeline, by citing the treaty. Joye Braun, an Indigenous Environmental Network organizer, said in a statement: 
We have never ceded this land. If DAPL can go through and claim eminent domain on landowners and Native peoples on their own land, then we as sovereign nations can then declare eminent domain on our own aboriginal homeland. We are here to protect the burial sites here. Highway 1806 has become the no surrender line. 
The Sacred Ground Camp had already existed for over a month with about 300 people camped out, but occupiers extended the camp on October 23 by creating three road blockades to prevent militarized law enforcement from entering. (This came just a day after police arrested roughly 127 water protectors [7] directly across the road from where private security for Energy Transfer had unleashed dogs [8] on activists one month earlier.) The camp also intended to halt construction where the remaining proposed pipeline route would connect with the Missouri River. 
Four days after declaring eminent domain for the camp, on October 27, law enforcement from seven states arrived there fully equipped with riot gear, all-terrain vehicles, armored vehicles and helicopters. They arrested 141 water protectors [9]‚Äîafter beating them with batons and issuing pepper spray. Law enforcement ultimately destroyed the camp, along with its tipis and sweat lodges. 
‚ÄúWe did everything in our power that we could do to defend our camp in a nonviolent approach,‚Äù says Cody Hall of the Cheyenne River Sioux Tribe. ‚ÄúBecause the only way to really defend it would have became a violent approach because you're meeting officers with a force of weaponry.‚Äù 
‚ÄúWe still honor those treaties, and I know the chairman has said that he expects America to do the same.‚Äù 
There are now talks of using the treaty to legally regain land rights to end the pipeline's construction, according to Hall and others on-site. There is a precedent for taking this approach: In May, the Lummi in Washington state called on the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers to reject a coal terminal permit on the premise that it would harm Lummi fishing grounds, which the federal government is legally mandated to protect per an 1855 treaty. The Lummi won [10]. No terminal was built, fishing grounds were not harmed and the treaty was honored. 
‚Äú[DAPL] brings to the surface all the issues dealing with treaties,"" says Bald Eagle. ""It brings up all the wrongdoings that have been happening in the past. The American government has repeatedly shoved all of their wrongdoings underneath the rug, and the issue with the Dakota Access Pipeline has pulled that rug off, and now we have to look at everything that‚Äôs been done wrong.‚Äù 
He lays out three choices for the U.S. government: correct its wrongs, put the rug back or commit another wrong. 
President Barack Obama [11], when interviewed by social media news site NowThis, stated that the Corps is figuring out [12] how to reroute the pipeline over the next several weeks, saying, ""There is a way for us to accommodate sacred lands of Native Americans."" But construction has nearly reached the Missouri River, sacred water for the Sioux. Several more weeks may be too late. Yessenia Funes is the climate justice reporter for Colorlines.

What the Clintons Did to Haiti,"Tweet Widget by Nathan J. Robinson 
Bill and Hillary Clinton‚Äôs role in the ‚Äúremaking‚Äù of Haiti after a devastating earthquake and foreign occupation is ‚Äúindefensible,‚Äù according to the author‚Äôs article, ‚ÄúSuperpredator: Bill Clinton‚Äôs Use and Abuse of Black America,‚Äù from which this piece is excerpted. ‚ÄúMany Clinton projects ‚Äúhave primarily benefited wealthy foreigners and the island‚Äôs ruling elite.‚Äù Other projects simply fizzled. ‚ÄúThe money donated and invested was extraordinary, but nobody seems to know where it has gone.‚Äù What the Clintons Did to Haiti by Nathan J. Robinson 
This article previously appeared in Global Research and Current Affairs . 
‚ÄúShe intended to ‚Äòmake Haiti the proving ground for her vision of American power.‚Äô‚Äù 
Bill and Hillary Clinton had long shared a personal interest in Haiti, dating back to the time of their honeymoon, part of which was spent in Port-au-Prince. In his autobiography, Bill says that his understanding of God and human nature were profoundly transformed when they witnessed a voodoo ceremony in which a woman bit the head off a live chicken. Hillary Clinton says the two of them ‚Äúfell in love‚Äù with Haiti and they had developed a ‚Äúdeep connection‚Äù to the country. So when Hillary Clinton became Secretary of State in 2009, she consciously made the redevelopment of Haiti one of her top priorities. The country, she announced, would be a laboratory where the United States could ‚Äúroad-test new approaches to development,‚Äù taking advantage of what she termed ‚Äúthe power of proximity.‚Äù She intended to ‚Äúmake Haiti the proving ground for her vision of American power.‚Äù Hillary Clinton selected her own chief of staff, Cheryl Mills, to run the Haiti project. 
Mills would be joined by Bill Clinton, who had been deputized by the U.N. as a ‚Äúspecial envoy‚Äù to Haiti. Bill‚Äôs role was not well-defined, and Haitians were curious about what was in store. Mills wrote in an email to Hillary Clinton that Haitians saw Bill‚Äôs appointment as ‚Äúa step toward putting Haiti in a protectorate or trusteeship status.‚Äù Soon, ‚Äújoking that he must be coming back to lead a new colonial regime,‚Äù the Haitian media ‚Äú dubbed him Le Gouverneur.‚Äù 
The project was heavily focused on increasing Haiti‚Äôs appeal to foreign corporations. As Politico reported , Clinton‚Äôs experiment ‚Äúhad business at its center: Aid would be replaced by investment, the growth of which would in turn benefit the United States.‚Äù 
‚ÄúClinton announced that Haiti would be a laboratory where the United States could road-test new approaches to development, taking advantage of ‚Äòthe power of proximity.‚Äô‚Äù 
One of the first acts in the new ‚Äúbusiness-centered‚Äù Haiti policy involved suppressing Haiti‚Äôs minimum wage. A 2009 Haitian law raised the minimum wage to 61 cents an hour, from 24 cents an hour previously. Haitian garment manufacturers, including contractors for Hanes and Levi Strauss, were furious, insisting that they were only willing to agree to a seven-cent increase. The manufacturers approached the U.S. State Department, who brought intense pressure to bear against Haitian President Ren√© Pr√©val, working to ‚Äúaggressively block‚Äù the 37-cent increase. The U.S. Deputy Mission Chief said a minimum-wage increase ‚Äúdid not take economic reality into account‚Äù and simply ‚Äúappealed to the unemployed and underpaid masses.‚Äù But as Ryan Chittum of the Columbia Journalism Review explained , the proposed wage increase would have been only the most trivial additional expense for the American garment manufacturers: 
‚ÄúAs of last year Hanes had 3,200 Haitians making t-shirts for it. Paying each of them two bucks a day more would cost it about $1.6 million a year. Hanesbrands Incorporated made $211 million on $4.3 billion in sales last year, and presumably it would pass on at least some of its higher labor costs to consumers. Or better yet, Hanesbrands CEO Richard Noll could forego some of his rich compensation package. He could pay for the raises for those 3,200 t-shirt makers with just one-sixth of the $10 million in salary and bonus he raked in last year.‚Äù 
‚ÄúU.S. Deputy Mission Chief said a minimum-wage increase ‚Äòdid not take economic reality into account‚Äù and simply ‚Äòappealed to the unemployed and underpaid masses.‚Äô‚Äù 
The truth of the ‚Äúeconomic reality‚Äù was that the Haitian undergarment sector was hardly likely to become wildly less competitive as a result of the increase. The effort to suppress the minimum wage was not solely a Clinton project. It was also a ‚Äúconcerted effort on the part of Haitian elites, factory owners, free trade proponents, U.S. politicians, economists, and American companies.‚Äù But it was in keeping with the State Department‚Äôs priorities under Clinton, which prioritized creating a favorable business climate. It was that same familiar Clinton move ‚Äúfrom aid to trade.‚Äù Bill Clinton‚Äôs program for Haitian development, designed by Oxford University economist Paul Collier, ‚Äú had garment exports at its center.‚Äù Collier wrote that because of ‚Äúpropitious‚Äù factors like ‚Äúpoverty and [a] relatively unregulated labor market, Haiti has labor costs that are fully competitive with China.‚Äù But the Clintons‚Äô role in Haiti would soon expand even further. In 2010, the country was struck by the worst earthquake in its history. The disaster killed 160,000 people and displaced over 1.5 million more. (The consequences of the earthquake were exacerbated by the ruined state of the Haitian food economy, plus the concentration of unemployed Haitian farmers in Port-au-Prince.) Bill Clinton was soon put in charge of the U.S.-led recovery effort. He was appointed to head the Interim Haiti Recovery Commission (IHRC), which would oversee a wide range of rebuilding projects. At President Obama‚Äôs request, Clinton and George W. Bush created the ‚ÄúClinton-Bush Haiti Fund,‚Äù and began aggressively fundraising around the world to support Haiti in the earthquake‚Äôs aftermath. (With Hillary Clinton as Secretary of State overseeing the efforts of USAID, the Clintons‚Äô importance to the recovery could not be overstated; Bill‚Äôs appointment meant that ‚Äúat every stage of Haiti‚Äôs reconstruction‚Äîfundraising, oversight and allocation‚Äîa Clinton was now involved.‚Äù 
Despite appearances, the Clinton-Bush fund was not focused on providing traditional relief. As they wrote , ‚Äú[w]hile other organizations in Haiti are using their resources to deliver immediate humanitarian aid, we are using our resources to focus on long-term development.‚Äù While the fund would advertise that ‚Äú100% of donations go directly to relief efforts,‚Äù Clinton and Bush adopted an expansive definition of ‚Äúrelief‚Äù efforts, treating luring foreign investment and jobs as a crucial part of earthquake recovery. On their website, they spoke proudly of what the New York Daily News characterized as a program of ‚Äúsupporting longterm programs to develop Haiti‚Äôs business class.‚Äù 
‚ÄúAt every stage of Haiti‚Äôs reconstruction‚Äîfundraising, oversight and allocation‚Äîa Clinton was now involved.‚Äù 
The strategy was an odd one. Port-au-Prince had been reduced to ruin, and Haitians were crowded into filthy tent cities, where many were dying of a cholera outbreak (which had itself been caused by the negligence of the United Nations). Whatever value building new garment factories may have had as a longterm economic plan, Haitians were faced with somewhat more pressing concerns like the basic provision of shelter and medicine, as well as the clearing of the thousands of tons of rubble that filled their streets. 
The Clinton-led recovery was a disaster. A year after the earthquake, a stinging report from Oxfam singled out Clinton‚Äôs IHRC as creating a ‚Äúquagmire of indecision and delay‚Äù that had made little progress toward successful earthquake recovery. Oxfam found that: 
‚Äú‚Ä¶less than half of the reconstruction aid promised by international donors has been disbursed. And while some of that money has been put toward temporary housing, almost none of the funds have been used for rubble removal.‚Äù 
Instead, the Clinton Foundation, IHRC, and State Department created what a Wall Street Journal writer called ‚Äúa mishmash of low quality, poorly thought-out development experiments and half-finished projects.‚Äù Haitian IHRC members lamented that the commission had produced ‚Äúa disparate bunch of approved projects. . . [that] do not address as a whole either the emergency situation or the recovery, let alone the development, of Haiti.‚Äù A 2013 investigation by the Government Accountability Office found that most money for the recovery was not being dispersed, and that the projects that were being worked on were plagued by delays and cost overruns. Many Clinton projects were extravagant public relations affairs that quickly fizzled. For example, The Washington Post reported that : 
‚Äú‚Ä¶[a] 2011 housing expo that cost more than $2 million, including $500,000 from the Clinton Foundation, was supposed to be a model for thousands of new units but instead has resulted in little more than a few dozen abandoned model homes occupied by squatters.‚Äù 
‚Äú A stinging report from Oxfam singled out Clinton‚Äôs IHRC as creating a ‚Äòquagmire of indecision and delay.‚Äô‚Äù 
Other Clinton ventures were seen as ‚Äúdisconnected from the realities of most people in the poorest country in the Western Hemisphere.‚Äù Politico reported that many Clinton projects ‚Äúhave primarily benefited wealthy foreigners and the island‚Äôs ruling elite, who needed little help to begin with.‚Äù For example, ‚Äúthe Clinton Bush Haiti Fund invested more than $2 million in the Royal Oasis Hotel, where a sleek suite with hardwood floors costs more than $200 a night and the shops sell $150 designer purses and $120 men‚Äôs dress shirts.‚Äù 
Predictably, the Royal Oasis didn‚Äôt do an especially roaring trade; The Washington Post reported that ‚Äú[o]ne recent afternoon, the hotel appeared largely empty, and with tourism hardly booming five years after the quake, locals fear it may be failing.‚Äù In a country with a 30-cent minimum wage, investing recovery dollars in a luxury hotel was not just offensive, but economically daft. Sometimes the recovery projects were accused not only of being pointless, but of being downright harmful. For instance, Bill Clinton had proudly announced that the Clinton Foundation would be funding the ‚Äúconstruction of emergency storm shelters in L√©og√¢ne.‚Äù But an investigation of the shelters that the Foundation had actually built found that they were ‚Äúshoddy and dangerous‚Äù and full of toxic mold. The Nation discovered , among other things, that the temperature in the shelters reached over 100 degrees, causing children to experience headaches and eye irritations (which may have been compounded by the mold), and that the trailers showed high levels of carcinogenic formaldehyde, linked to asthma and other lung diseases. The Clinton Foundation had subcontracted the building of the shelters to Clayton Homes, a firm that had already been sued in the United States by the Federal Emergency Management Administration (FEMA) for ‚Äúhaving provided formaldehyde-laced trailers to Hurricane Katrina victims.‚Äù (Clayton Homes was owned by Warren Buffett ‚Äôs Berkshire Hathaway, and Buffett had been a longstanding major donor to the Clinton Foundation.) The Nation ‚Äôs investigation reported on children whose classes were being held in Clinton Foundation trailers. Their semester had just been cut short, and the students sent home, because the temperature in the classrooms had grown unbearable. The misery of the students in the Clinton trailers was described: 
‚ÄúJudith Seide, a student in Lubert‚Äôs sixth-grade class [explained that] she and her classmates regularly suffer from painful headaches in their new Clinton Foundation classroom. Every day, she said, her ‚Äòhead hurts and I feel it spinning and have to stop moving, otherwise I‚Äôd fall.‚Äô Her vision goes dark, as is the case with her classmate Judel, who sometimes can‚Äôt open his eyes because, said Seide, ‚Äòhe‚Äôs allergic to the heat.‚Äô Their teacher regularly relocates the class outside into the shade of the trailer because the swelter inside is insufferable. Sitting in the sixth-grade classroom, student Mondialie Cineas, who dreams of becoming a nurse, said that three times a week the teacher gives her and her classmates painkillers so that they can make it through the school day. ‚ÄòAt noon, the class gets so hot, kids get headaches,‚Äô the 12-year-old said, wiping beads of sweat from her brow. She is worried because ‚Äòthe kids feel sick, can‚Äôt work, can‚Äôt advance to succeed.‚Äô‚Äù 
‚ÄúThree times a week the teacher gives her and her classmates painkillers so that they can make it through the school day.‚Äù 
The most notorious post-earthquake development project, however, was the Caracol industrial park . The park was pitched as a major job creator, part of the goal of helping Haiti ‚Äúbuild back better‚Äù than it was before. The State Department touted the prospect of 100,000 new jobs for Haitians, with Hillary Clinton promising 65,000 jobs within five years. The industrial park followed the Clintons‚Äô preexisting development model for Haiti: public/private partnerships with a heavy emphasis on the garment industry. Even though there were still hundreds of thousands of evacuees living in tents, the project was based on ‚Äúthe more expansive view that, in a desperately poor country where traditional foreign aid has chronically failed, fostering economic development is as important as replacing what fell down.‚Äù Much of the planning was focused on trying to lure a South Korean clothing manufacturer to set up shop there, by plying them with U.S. taxpayer funding. The Caracol project was ‚Äúthe centerpiece‚Äù of the U.S.‚Äôs recovery effort. A gala celebrating its opening featured the Clintons and Sean Penn, and it was treated as the emblem of the new, ‚Äúbetter‚Äù Haiti, that would demonstrate the country‚Äôs commitment to being ‚Äúopen for business.‚Äù In order to build the park, hundreds of poor farmers were evicted from their land, so that millions of dollars could be spent transforming it. 
But the project was a terrible disappointment. After four years, it was only operating at 10% capacity , and the jobs had failed to materialize : 
Far from 100,000 jobs‚Äîor even the 60,000 promised within five years of the park‚Äôs opening‚Äî ‚ÄúCaracol currently employs just 5,479 people full time. That comes out to roughly $55,000 in investment per job created so far; or, to put it another way, about 30 times more per job than the average [Caracol] worker makes per year. The park, built on the site of a former U.S. Marine-run slave labor camp during the 1915-1934 U.S. occupation, has the best-paved roads and manicured sidewalks in the country, but most of the land remains vacant.‚Äù 
Most of the seized farmland went unused, then, and even for the remaining farmers, ‚Äú surges of wastewater have caused floods and spoiled crops.‚Äù Huge queues of unemployed Haitians stood daily in front of the factory, awaiting jobs that did not exist. The Washington Post described the scene: 
‚ÄúEach morning, crowds line up outside the park‚Äôs big front gate, which is guarded by four men in crisp khaki uniforms carrying shotguns. They wait in a sliver of shade next to a cinder-block wall, many holding r√©sum√©s in envelopes. Most said they have been coming every day for months, waiting for jobs that pay about $5 a day. From his envelope, Jean Mito Palvetus, 27, pulled out a diploma attesting that he had completed 200 hours of training with the U.S. Agency for International Development on an industrial sewing machine. ‚ÄòI have three kids and a wife, and I can‚Äôt support them,‚Äô he said, sweating in the hot morning sun. ‚ÄòI have a diploma, but I still can‚Äôt get a job here. I still have nothing.‚Äô‚Äù 
‚Äú The interests of the market, the interest of foreigners are prioritized over the majority of people who are impoverished in Haiti.‚Äù 
For some , the Caracol project perfectly symbolized the Clinton approach: big promises, an emphasis on sweatshops, incompetent management, and little concern for the actual impact on Haitians. ‚ÄúCaracol is a prime example of bad help,‚Äù as one Haiti scholar put it . ‚ÄúThe interests of the market, the interest of foreigners are prioritized over the majority of people who are impoverished in Haiti.‚Äù 
But, failure as it may have been, the Caracol factory was among the more successful of the projects, insofar as it actually came into existence. A large amount of the money raised by Bill Clinton after the earthquake, and pledged by the U.S. under Hillary Clinton, simply disappeared without a trace, its whereabouts unknown. As Politico explained : 
‚ÄúEven Bill‚Äôs U.N. Office of the Special Envoy couldn‚Äôt track where all of [it] went‚Äîand the truth is that still today no one really knows how much money was spent ‚Äòrebuilding‚Äô Haiti. Many initial pledges never materialized. A whopping $465 million of the relief money went through the Pentagon, which spent it on deployment of U.S. troops‚Äî20,000 at the high water mark, many of whom never set foot on Haitian soil. That money included fuel for ships and planes, helicopter repairs and inscrutables such as an $18,000 contract for a jungle gym‚Ä¶ Huge contracts were doled out to the usual array of major contractors, including a $16.7 million logistics contract whose partners included Agility Public Warehousing KSC, a Kuwaiti firm that was supposed to have been blacklisted from doing business with Washington after a 2009 indictment alleging a conspiracy to defraud the U.S. government during the Iraq War.‚Äù 
The recovery under the Clintons became notorious for its mismanagement. Clinton staffers ‚Äú had no idea what Haiti was like and had no sensitivity to the Haitians.‚Äù They were reportedly rude and condescending toward Haitians, even refusing to admit Haitian government ministers to meetings about recovery plans. While the Clintons called in high-profile consulting firms like McKinsey to draw up plans, they had little interest in listening to Haitians themselves. The former Haitian prime minister spoke of a ‚Äúweak‚Äù American staff who were ‚Äúmore interested in supporting Clinton than helping Haiti.‚Äù 
‚ÄúA large amount of the money raised by Bill Clinton after the earthquake, and pledged by the U.S. under Hillary Clinton, simply disappeared without a trace, its whereabouts unknown.‚Äù 
One of those shocked by the failure of the recovery effort was Chelsea Clinton, who wrote a detailed email to her parents in which she said that while Haitians were trying to help themselves, every part of the international aid effort, both governmental and nongovernmental, was falling short. ‚ÄúThe incompetence is mind numbing,‚Äù she wrote . Chelsea produced a detailed memorandum recommending drastic steps that needed to be taken in order to get the recovery on track. But the memo was kept within the Clinton family, released only later under a Freedom of Information Act disclosure of Hillary‚Äôs State Department correspondence. If it had come out at the time, as Haiti journalist Jonathan Katz writes , it ‚Äúwould have obliterated the public narrative of helpful outsiders saving grateful earthquake survivors that her mother‚Äôs State Department was working so hard to promote.‚Äù 
The Clintons‚Äô Haiti recovery ended with a whimper. The Clinton-Bush Haiti Fund distributed the last of its funds in 2012 and disbanded, without any attempt at further fundraising. The IHRC ‚Äú quietly closed their doors‚Äù in October of 2011, even though little progress had been made. As the Boston Review ‚Äôs Jake Johnston explained , though hundreds of thousands remained displaced, the IHRC wiped its hands of the housing situation: 
‚Äú[L]ittle remained of the grand plans to build thousands of new homes. Instead, those left homeless would be given a small, one-time rental subsidy of about $500. These subsidies, funded by a number of different aid agencies, were meant to give private companies the incentive to invest in building houses. As efforts to rebuild whole neighborhoods faltered, the rental subsidies turned Haitians into consumers, and the housing problem was handed over to the private sector.‚Äù 
The Clintons themselves simply stopped speaking about Haiti. After the first two years, they were ‚Äúnowhere to be seen‚Äù there, despite Hillary‚Äôs having promised that her commitment to Haiti would long outlast her tenure as Secretary of State. Haiti has been given little attention during Hillary Clinton‚Äôs presidential campaign, even though the Haiti project was ostensibly one of great pride for both Clintons. 
‚ÄúOne of those shocked by the failure of the recovery effort was Chelsea Clinton.‚Äù 
The widespread consensus among observers is that the Haiti recovery, which TIME called the U.S.‚Äôs ‚Äúcompassionate invasion,‚Äù was a catastrophically mismanaged disappointment. Jonathan Katz writes that ‚Äúit‚Äôs hard to find anyone these days who looks back on the U.S.-led response to the January 12, 2010, Haiti earthquake as a success.‚Äù While plenty of money was channeled into the country, it largely went to what were ‚Äúlittle more than small pilot projects‚Äîa new set of basketball hoops and a model elementary school here, a functioning factory there.‚Äù 
The end result has been that little has changed for Haiti. ‚ÄúHaitians find themselves in a social and economic situation that is worse than before the earthquake,‚Äù reports a Belgian photojournalist who has spent 10 years in Haiti: 
‚ÄúEveryone says that they‚Äôre living in worse conditions than before‚Ä¶ When you look at the history of humanitarian relief, there‚Äôs never been a situation when such a small country has been the target of such a massive influx of money and assistance in such a short span of time‚Ä¶ On paper, with that much money in a territory the size of Haiti, we should have witnessed miracles; there should have been results.‚Äù 
‚ÄúIf anything, they appear worse off,‚Äù says Foreign Policy of Haiti‚Äôs farmers. ‚ÄúI really cannot understand how you could raise so much money, put a former U.S. president in charge, and get this outcome,‚Äù said one Haitian official. Indeed, the money donated and invested was extraordinary. But nobody seems to know where it has gone. 
Haitians direct much of the blame toward the Clintons. As a former Haitian government official who worked on the recovery said , ‚Äú[t]here is a lot of resentment about Clinton here. People have not seen results. . .. They say that Clinton used Haiti.‚Äù Haitians ‚Äú increasingly complain that Clinton-backed projects have often helped the country‚Äôs elite and international business investors more than they have helped poor ‚ÄòHaitians.‚Äù There is a ‚Äúsuspicion that their motives are more to make a profit in Haiti than to help it.‚Äù And that while ‚Äústriking a populist pose, in practice they were attracted to power in Haiti.‚Äù 
But perhaps we should be more forgiving of the Clintons‚Äô conduct during the Haitian recovery. After all, instead of doing true harm, the Clintons simply failed to do much good. And perhaps it‚Äôs better to have a luxury hotel than not to have one, better to have a few jobs than none at all. Thanks to Bill Clinton, there‚Äôs a gleaming new industrial park, albeit one operating at a fraction of its capacity. 
Yet it‚Äôs a mistake to measure Clinton against what would have happened if the United States had done nothing at all for Haiti. The question is what would have happened if a capable, nonfamous administrator, rather than a globetrotting narcissist, had been placed in charge. Tens of millions of dollars were donated toward the Haiti recovery by people across the world; it was an incredible outpouring of generosity. The squandering of that money on half-baked development schemes (mainly led by cronies ), and the ignoring of Haitians‚Äô own demands, mean that Clinton may have caused considerable harm through his failure. Plenty of people died in tent cities that would not have died if the world‚Äôs donations had been used effectively. 
‚ÄúDefending the Clintons‚Äô Haiti record is an impossible endeavor.‚Äù 
Democrats have bristled at recent attempts by Donald Trump to criticize Hillary Clinton over her record in Haiti. Jonathan Katz, whose in-depth reporting from Haiti was stingingly critical of the Clintons, has now changed his tune , insisting that we all bear the responsibility for the failed recovery effort. When Trump accused the Clintons of squandering millions building ‚Äúa sweatshop‚Äù in Haiti in the form of the Caracol park, media fact-checkers quickly insisted he was spewing Pinocchios. The Washington Post said that while Clinton Foundation donors may have financially benefited from the factory-building project, they benefited ‚Äúwrit large‚Äù rather than ‚Äúdirectly.‚Äù The Post cited the words of the factory‚Äôs spokesman as evidence that the factory was not a sweatshop, and pointed out that Caracol workers earned at least ‚Äúminimum wage‚Äù (failing to mention that minimum wage in Haiti remains well under a dollar). PolitiFact also rated the sweatshop claim ‚Äúmostly false,‚Äù even though Katz notes ‚Äúlong hours, tough conditions, and low pay‚Äù at the factory and PolitiFact acknowledges the ‚Äúongoing theft of legally-earned wages.‚Äù 
Defending the Clintons‚Äô Haiti record is an impossible endeavor, one Democrats should probably not bother attempting. As the Center for Economic and Policy Research, which has studied the recovery, noted , when it comes to the Clinton-led recovery mission, ‚Äúit‚Äôs hard to say it‚Äôs been anything other than a failure.‚Äù Haitians are not delusional in their resentment of the Clintons; they have good reason to feel as if they were used for publicity, and discarded by the Clintons when they became inconvenient. 
None of this means that one should vote for Donald Trump for president. His tears for Haiti are those of a highly opportunistic crocodile, and his interest in the country‚Äôs wellbeing began at the precise moment that it could be used a bludgeon with which to beat his political opponent. As we have previously noted in this publication , one does not need to be convinced that Hillary Clinton is an honorable person in order to be convinced that she is the preferable candidate. It is important, however, not to maintain any illusions, not to stifle or massage the truth in the service of short-term electoral concerns. It remains simultaneously true that a Clinton presidency is our present least-worst option and that what the Clintons did to Haiti was callous, selfish, and indefensible.",1

‚ÄúWe are witnessing the end of the neoliberal era,‚Äù said Dr. Cornel West , the nation‚Äôs most prominent Black public intellectual, assessing the import of last week‚Äôs election. West backed Bernie Sanders in the Democratic primaries, then endorsed the Green Party‚Äôs presidential ticket. The election ‚Äúdid not go left-populist, following Bernie Sanders and Jill Stein,‚Äù he said. Instead, ‚Äúit went rightwing-fascist. But the neoliberal era is coming to a close and the neoliberal establishment is being exposed. The issues of class now are becoming much more central.‚Äù Trump Supporters Mounted an ‚ÄúInsurrection‚Äù 
Duboisian scholar Dr. Anthony Monteiro was among the few observers on the Left that thought Donald Trump would win at the polls. But, even he was startled at the scope of Trump‚Äôs sweep. ‚ÄúI felt that the insurgency would grow and deepen, but I never thought that it would become an insurrection,‚Äù said Monteiro. ‚ÄúIn a certain sense, white working and poor people in these small, rust belt towns have a sense of achievement in having brought the Clintons down that Black people had in 2008 when Barack Obama was elected with a huge Black turnout,‚Äù he said. Monteiro is one of the organizers of a Conference on Political Science for Radical Times, set for December 9-10, in Philadelphia. TPP ‚ÄúOn Its Death Bed‚Äù 
With Donald Trump‚Äôs victory, President Obama‚Äôs Trans Pacific Partnership corporate rights trade deal is ‚Äúlooking like it‚Äôs on its death bed,‚Äù said Kevin Zeese , of Popular Resistance. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôve worked for five years to make TPP stand for Toxic Political Poison, and that seems to have happened,‚Äù said Zeese. Trump won in ‚Äúthe rust belt that was destroyed by NAFTA‚Äù -- Bill Clinton‚Äôs jobs-exporting bill of a generation ago -- ‚Äúand was going to be threatened again by TPP.‚Äù Zeese said Obama may make a last bid to pass TPP in the lame duck session of Congress that begins this week. Finally, a Practical Guide to Black Self-Determination 
The Black is Back Coalition for Social Justice, Peace and Reparations adopted a 19-point Black Political Agenda for Self-Determination, at a conference in Washington. The document applies the principle of self-determination to the broadest range of issues, from Black Community Control of the Police, to Mass Black Incarceration, to Nationalization of the Banks. ‚ÄúEverybody wants self-determination,‚Äù said Coalition chairman Omali Yeshitela , ‚Äúbut what does it mean, practically?‚Äù The 19 points give direction to the struggle. ‚ÄúThis isn‚Äôt something you work on every four years,‚Äù said Yeshitela. ‚ÄúThis is something you work on every day. This is our program.‚Äù 
Margaret Kimberley , an editor and senior columnist for Black Agenda Report, told the conference: ‚ÄúWhen we meet together, today, we are showing the world what self-determination looks like.‚Äù Voting for ‚Äúyour enemies‚Äù is not self-determination, and ‚Äúthinking that electoral politics is the only road to liberation is not self-determination,‚Äù said Kimberley.

None of Them Have Ever Been My President,"  by BAR   
Tens of thousands have demonstrated against the election of Donald Trump. Some are activists, continuing the struggle. Others are Democrats that are just ‚Äúmad.‚Äù ‚ÄúThe Black movement against police terror didn‚Äôt need a Donald Trump waiting in the vestibule of the White House to get ‚Äúmad.‚Äù For those who fear Trump‚Äôs ‚Äúfascism,‚Äù the threat level ‚Äúdepends on how he uses the arsenal of repressive tools bequeathed to him by the Obama administration.‚Äù None of Them Have Ever Been My President by BAR   
‚ÄúYou can‚Äôt scare people with a specter if they have already been in combat with the real thing.‚Äù 
As a revolutionary Black nationalist whose socialism predates my facial hairs, I have no problem saying Donald Trump is not my president. Neither is the current occupant of the White House, nor were any of the Democrats, Republicans and Whigs that preceded him. 
On a chilly November day in 2009 a newly-created coalition, of which I was a co-founder, marched on the White House to denounce and renounce Barack Obama as a tool of white supremacy and the imperial war machine. ‚ÄúObama, Obama, you can‚Äôt hide ‚Äì We charge you with genocide,‚Äù we shouted, indicting the First Black President for the crimes he was busily committing in service to his masters on Wall Street. The Black is Back Coalition for Social Justice, Peace and Reparations had been formed less than two months before, largely to demonstrate that not all Black people were bamboozled by the slick corporate politician from Chicago, elected one year earlier in the nation‚Äôs first billion dollar presidential campaign. As the Coalition‚Äôs founding press release stated : 
‚ÄúBlack and Brown people continue to suffer the brunt of un/under-employment and predatory loan scandal crises. Military spending under Obama has increased as have the warfare this nation continues to export to Iraq, Afghanistan, Pakistan, Venezuela and Colombia. Mass incarceration, police brutality and political imprisonment remain rampant...‚Äù 
The Black is Back Coalition warned of the ‚Äútraps set by Obama‚Äôs so-called ‚Äòpost-racial‚Äô politics that perpetuates the same oppressive militarist agenda well known during the Bush regime.‚Äù 
To paraphrase Fidel Castro, history has vindicated us. 
‚ÄúObama joined George Bush and Bill Clinton in perpetuating the 20 year-long slaughter in the Democratic Republic of Congo that has claimed more than six million lives.‚Äù 
Obama mobilized NATO air forces and jihadist proxies to destroy Libya, which had previously enjoyed the highest living standard in Africa. He redeployed these same al Qaida terrorists to Syria, killing 400,000 people, displacing half the surviving population and bringing the U.S. to the very brink of nuclear war with Russia. This so-called ‚ÄúSon of Africa‚Äù has effectively occupied most of the continent through a U.S. Military Command (AFRICOM) that was less than a year old when Obama was sworn into office. The African Union provides diplomatic cover for the CIA-run ‚Äúpeace keeping‚Äù mission in Somalia, while U.S. conventional forces have infiltrated the militaries of all but two African nations. The holdouts, Eritrea and Zimbabwe, are under constant threat of regime change. Obama joined George Bush and Bill Clinton in perpetuating the 20 year-long slaughter in the Democratic Republic of Congo that has claimed more than six million lives, the worst genocide since World War Two (‚ÄúObama, Obama, you can‚Äôt hide, We charge you with genocide!‚Äù) 
With the eager assistance of Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, Obama baldly abetted a Nazi-spearheaded coup against the elected government in Ukraine -- and then blamed Moscow when Russian-speaking Ukrainians resisted, provoking a ‚ÄúNew Cold War‚Äù that could turn hot in an instant. At the same time, Obama ‚Äúpivoted‚Äù to militarily confront China, whose economy is already, by some measures, larger than the U.S. The jihadist war in Syria should also be seen as a theater of imperialism‚Äôs last ditch offensive to encircle ‚ÄúEurasia‚Äù in hopes of preserving U.S.-based multinational corporate domination of a ‚Äúrigged‚Äù system of dollar-based world trade. 
Just as the Black is Back Coalition warned, Barack Obama was the Black face of imperialism -- a change of color without a difference. He tried to hand off the controls to Hillary Clinton, who got six million votes less than he did, and lost. 
Back in 2007, when Obama and Clinton were pretending to be ideological opponents -- as cookie-cutter corporate Democrats often do -- we at Black Agenda Report wrote that ‚Äú There‚Äôs not a dime‚Äôs worth of difference ‚Äù between the two. Every decent, peace-loving person on Earth should be glad to be rid of both of them. Humanity would probably not survive another year of either one. 
‚ÄúBarack Obama was the Black face of imperialism -- a change of color without a difference.‚Äù 
Donald Trump is also a danger to humanity, like every other U.S. chief executive since Truman nuked Hiroshima and Nagasaki. If words mean anything, Trump starts off posing less of a doomsday international menace, since he claims to want to establish talking, rather than shouting, threatening, nuke-rattling relations with Russia and China, while Clinton‚Äôs version of ‚Äúreset‚Äù was an armed confrontation with Russia over the skies of Syria. Of course, all that could quickly change. Trump may be a ‚Äúparty of one‚Äù among Republicans in Congress and even in his own cabinet. 
For those who fear Trump‚Äôs ‚Äúfascism,‚Äù the threat level depends on how he uses the arsenal of repressive tools bequeathed to him by the Obama administration. These legal, infrastructural and technological instruments of the national security state are fascist in their intent; they were made for the purpose of tracking, disorganizing, neutralizing and locking up dissidents, and disinforming the public at large. Thus, President Obama and his predecessors were fascist- minded , whether you call their administrations operatively fascist or not. The Obama administration would not have pushed a bill through Congress allowing the U.S. military to detain American citizens without trial or charge if he had not anticipating using it. He would not have feverishly upgraded an omnipresent national and global surveillance apparatus if he did not anticipate putting it to the task of martial rule. Fascist-minded is all that can be said of Trump, at this point, as well. 
Black Lives Matter activists have been under FBI surveillance since day one. Ever since Ferguson, the federal government has taken the lead in over-charging ‚Äúrioters‚Äù in rebellious cities. New York City cops have used social media surveillance as the basis for conspiracy charges against groups of more than 100 young Black people in separate sweeps in Manhattan and The Bronx. The ‚Äúfascism‚Äù that correctly described Jim Crow rule in the pre-Civil Rights South lives on at the core of the mass Black incarceration regime put in place with the crushing of the Black Liberation Movement, two generations ago. The current movement against police terror, which ultimately demands Black community control of the police, put activists in direct confrontation with the coercive arm of the State. There is no retreat from this response to the demands of Black people ‚Äúon the street,‚Äù who bear the daily brunt of repression and are also among the most effective organizers. 
‚ÄúObama would not have feverishly upgraded an omnipresent national and global surveillance apparatus if he did not anticipate putting it to the task of martial rule.‚Äù 
The Black movement against police terror didn‚Äôt need a Donald Trump waiting in the vestibule of the White House to get ‚Äúmad.‚Äù The movement has already crossed the Rubicon of confrontation with the State. The moment occurred in the second term of the First Black President, when a new generation learned that liberation cannot be vicariously experienced. The 21 st century Black movement emerged with the knowledge that Black corporate Democrats are not their allies, nor are Black police chiefs, or Black preachers whose real loyalties are to the Democratic Party and its Wall Street patrons. 
If the Black movement were afraid of the likes of Donald Trump, it never would have gone up against the militarized police that occupy Black communities. You can‚Äôt scare people with a specter if they have already been in combat with the real thing. 
To the extent that electoral activity is useful to the movement, it should be employed with special vigilance close at hand, against misleaders like the 32 members of the Congressional Black Caucus who failed to support the Grayson Amendment that would have halted Pentagon transfers of weapons and equipment to local police departments. These ‚Äú Treasonous 32 ‚Äù, comprising 80 percent of full-voting Black Democrats in the House, cast their shameful votes in June, 2014, just two months before Michael Brown was shot down in Ferguson, Missouri. (Rep. William ‚ÄúLacy‚Äù Clay, representing Michael Brown‚Äôs district, was among the 32.) If the movement is to have any special targets for electoral vengeance, it is these homegrown enemies, who turn Black people‚Äôs votes against themselves. 
Trump or no Trump, the Black movement must continue to press and refine its demands -- or Power will concede nothing. On November 6, after their annual march on the White House, the organizations of the Black is Back Coalition ratified a 19-point document that puts self-determination at the heart of the broadest range of issues confronting Black America: ‚ÄúEvery central demand, every strategy of struggle, must be formulated with the goal of self-determination in mind. Otherwise, the movement will allow itself to be drowned in reformist schemes and projects that bind Black people even more tightly to structures of outside control.‚Äù The points range from ‚ÄúBlack Community Control of Police,‚Äù to ‚ÄúHalting Gentrification,‚Äù to ‚ÄúNationalization of the Banks.‚Äù 
The points were compiled during Barack Obama‚Äôs time in the White House, and they will remain relevant under a President Donald Trump. 
We‚Äôve been mad. Let‚Äôs get organized, and get free.  ",1

As the Coalition‚Äôs founding press release stated : 
‚ÄúBlack and Brown people continue to suffer the brunt of un/under-employment and predatory loan scandal crises. Military spending under Obama has increased as have the warfare this nation continues to export to Iraq, Afghanistan, Pakistan, Venezuela and Colombia. Mass incarceration, police brutality and political imprisonment remain rampant...‚Äù 
The Black is Back Coalition warned of the ‚Äútraps set by Obama‚Äôs so-called ‚Äòpost-racial‚Äô politics that perpetuates the same oppressive militarist agenda well known during the Bush regime.‚Äù 
To paraphrase Fidel Castro, history has vindicated us. 
‚ÄúObama joined George Bush and Bill Clinton in perpetuating the 20 year-long slaughter in the Democratic Republic of Congo that has claimed more than six million lives.‚Äù 
Obama mobilized NATO air forces and jihadist proxies to destroy Libya, which had previously enjoyed the highest living standard in Africa. He redeployed these same al Qaida terrorists to Syria, killing 400,000 people, displacing half the surviving population and bringing the U.S. to the very brink of nuclear war with Russia. This so-called ‚ÄúSon of Africa‚Äù has effectively occupied most of the continent through a U.S. Military Command (AFRICOM) that was less than a year old when Obama was sworn into office. The African Union provides diplomatic cover for the CIA-run ‚Äúpeace keeping‚Äù mission in Somalia, while U.S. conventional forces have infiltrated the militaries of all but two African nations. The holdouts, Eritrea and Zimbabwe, are under constant threat of regime change. Obama joined George Bush and Bill Clinton in perpetuating the 20 year-long slaughter in the Democratic Republic of Congo that has claimed more than six million lives, the worst genocide since World War Two (‚ÄúObama, Obama, you can‚Äôt hide, We charge you with genocide!‚Äù) 
With the eager assistance of Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, Obama baldly abetted a Nazi-spearheaded coup against the elected government in Ukraine -- and then blamed Moscow when Russian-speaking Ukrainians resisted, provoking a ‚ÄúNew Cold War‚Äù that could turn hot in an instant. At the same time, Obama ‚Äúpivoted‚Äù to militarily confront China, whose economy is already, by some measures, larger than the U.S. The jihadist war in Syria should also be seen as a theater of imperialism‚Äôs last ditch offensive to encircle ‚ÄúEurasia‚Äù in hopes of preserving U.S.-based multinational corporate domination of a ‚Äúrigged‚Äù system of dollar-based world trade. 
Just as the Black is Back Coalition warned, Barack Obama was the Black face of imperialism -- a change of color without a difference. He tried to hand off the controls to Hillary Clinton, who got six million votes less than he did, and lost. 
Back in 2007, when Obama and Clinton were pretending to be ideological opponents -- as cookie-cutter corporate Democrats often do -- we at Black Agenda Report wrote that ‚Äú There‚Äôs not a dime‚Äôs worth of difference ‚Äù between the two. Every decent, peace-loving person on Earth should be glad to be rid of both of them. Humanity would probably not survive another year of either one. 
‚ÄúBarack Obama was the Black face of imperialism -- a change of color without a difference.‚Äù 
Donald Trump is also a danger to humanity, like every other U.S. chief executive since Truman nuked Hiroshima and Nagasaki. If words mean anything, Trump starts off posing less of a doomsday international menace, since he claims to want to establish talking, rather than shouting, threatening, nuke-rattling relations with Russia and China, while Clinton‚Äôs version of ‚Äúreset‚Äù was an armed confrontation with Russia over the skies of Syria. Of course, all that could quickly change. Trump may be a ‚Äúparty of one‚Äù among Republicans in Congress and even in his own cabinet. 
For those who fear Trump‚Äôs ‚Äúfascism,‚Äù the threat level depends on how he uses the arsenal of repressive tools bequeathed to him by the Obama administration. These legal, infrastructural and technological instruments of the national security state are fascist in their intent; they were made for the purpose of tracking, disorganizing, neutralizing and locking up dissidents, and disinforming the public at large. Thus, President Obama and his predecessors were fascist- minded , whether you call their administrations operatively fascist or not. The Obama administration would not have pushed a bill through Congress allowing the U.S. military to detain American citizens without trial or charge if he had not anticipating using it. He would not have feverishly upgraded an omnipresent national and global surveillance apparatus if he did not anticipate putting it to the task of martial rule. Fascist-minded is all that can be said of Trump, at this point, as well. 
Black Lives Matter activists have been under FBI surveillance since day one. Ever since Ferguson, the federal government has taken the lead in over-charging ‚Äúrioters‚Äù in rebellious cities. New York City cops have used social media surveillance as the basis for conspiracy charges against groups of more than 100 young Black people in separate sweeps in Manhattan and The Bronx. The ‚Äúfascism‚Äù that correctly described Jim Crow rule in the pre-Civil Rights South lives on at the core of the mass Black incarceration regime put in place with the crushing of the Black Liberation Movement, two generations ago. The current movement against police terror, which ultimately demands Black community control of the police, put activists in direct confrontation with the coercive arm of the State. There is no retreat from this response to the demands of Black people ‚Äúon the street,‚Äù who bear the daily brunt of repression and are also among the most effective organizers. 
‚ÄúObama would not have feverishly upgraded an omnipresent national and global surveillance apparatus if he did not anticipate putting it to the task of martial rule.‚Äù 
The Black movement against police terror didn‚Äôt need a Donald Trump waiting in the vestibule of the White House to get ‚Äúmad.‚Äù The movement has already crossed the Rubicon of confrontation with the State. The moment occurred in the second term of the First Black President, when a new generation learned that liberation cannot be vicariously experienced. The 21 st century Black movement emerged with the knowledge that Black corporate Democrats are not their allies, nor are Black police chiefs, or Black preachers whose real loyalties are to the Democratic Party and its Wall Street patrons. 
If the Black movement were afraid of the likes of Donald Trump, it never would have gone up against the militarized police that occupy Black communities. You can‚Äôt scare people with a specter if they have already been in combat with the real thing. 
To the extent that electoral activity is useful to the movement, it should be employed with special vigilance close at hand, against misleaders like the 32 members of the Congressional Black Caucus who failed to support the Grayson Amendment that would have halted Pentagon transfers of weapons and equipment to local police departments. These ‚Äú Treasonous 32 ‚Äù, comprising 80 percent of full-voting Black Democrats in the House, cast their shameful votes in June, 2014, just two months before Michael Brown was shot down in Ferguson, Missouri. (Rep. William ‚ÄúLacy‚Äù Clay, representing Michael Brown‚Äôs district, was among the 32.) If the movement is to have any special targets for electoral vengeance, it is these homegrown enemies, who turn Black people‚Äôs votes against themselves. 
Trump or no Trump, the Black movement must continue to press and refine its demands -- or Power will concede nothing. On November 6, after their annual march on the White House, the organizations of the Black is Back Coalition ratified a 19-point document that puts self-determination at the heart of the broadest range of issues confronting Black America: ‚ÄúEvery central demand, every strategy of struggle, must be formulated with the goal of self-determination in mind. Otherwise, the movement will allow itself to be drowned in reformist schemes and projects that bind Black people even more tightly to structures of outside control.‚Äù The points range from ‚ÄúBlack Community Control of Police,‚Äù to ‚ÄúHalting Gentrification,‚Äù to ‚ÄúNationalization of the Banks.‚Äù 
The points were compiled during Barack Obama‚Äôs time in the White House, and they will remain relevant under a President Donald Trump. 
We‚Äôve been mad. Let‚Äôs get organized, and get free. BAR executive editor Glen Ford can be contacted  ",1
Time For the Real Left To Double Down on Single Payer Medicare For All,"Tweet Widget A Black Agenda Radio Commentary by Bruce A. Dixon 
Under President Obama, Democrats threw away their mandate to fight for health care for. Instead they let insurance companies concoct Obamacare, sketchy policies, skimpy coverage, high deductibles and co-pays for half the uninsured and empty promises for the other half. A Gallup Poll confirms that 58% of Americans want to see Obamacare replaced with a single payer system to guarantee health care, not health insurance for everybody. Time For the Real Left To Double Down on Single Payer Medicare For All A Black Agenda Radio Commentary by Bruce A. Dixon 
The Affordable Care Act, which President elect Trump promises to repeal and replace with nobody knows what, was never all it was cracked up to be. 
The promise to deliver affordable health care was a key campaign issue in 2007 and 2008. But while most Americans demanded a single payer system to replace the private insurance companies, and guarantee health care for everyone, the 44 th president his corporate funded Democrats instead delivered Obamacare ‚Äì- billions in tax dollars to insurance companies for policies with skimpy coverage and such high co-pays and deductibles that many families cannot afford to use their new health insurance. Worse still, Obamacare only provided these sketchy policies to about half the uninsured leaving the rest to the tender mercies of state governments which control Medicaid. 
Ever since 2009 corporate Democrats have justified their treachery with claims that single payer Medicare For All was impossible to get through even the majority Democratic Congress of 2009 and 2010. Hillary Clinton also declared single payer dead on arrival should she be elected. But Hillary was not elected, and even though this is the fourth consecutive Republican dominated Congress, and Republican politicians hate Medicare For All just as much as their Democratic rivals, the popular mandate for single payer health care is very much alive. 
A May 2016 Gallup Poll confirms that ‚Äú...58% of U.S. adults favor the idea of replacing the law (Obamacare) with a federally funded healthcare system that provides insurance for all Americans.‚Äù The question for the left, however you read that term is what do we do about this? The answer has to be that we fight for what we know people want and need with all the means at our disposal. In the present era, the willingness to organize, to agitate, to educate, to demonstrate and to demand health care ‚Äì- not health insurance, but health care for everybody as a human right is one of the markers by which we can tell actual flesh and blood leftists and their organizations from those who merely fake the funk until the next Democrat takes office. It‚Äôs worth noting that the Green Party‚Äô candidates Jill Stein and Ajamu Baraka were the only ones in this election calling for single payer health care. 
A 2009 study by the National Nurses Union reveals that adoption of Medicare For All would create 2.6 million new jobs, from doctors and nurses to a host of health care professionals and technicians. That‚Äôs as many jobs as were lost in the 2007-2009 recession. It would inject #75 billion per year into the US economy, including $100 billion in wages alone. President Trump won in part because he told people he‚Äôd ‚Äúbring back the jobs.‚Äù But steel mill jobs are imaginary, fictitious. Health care jobs are real. 
The tens or hundreds of thousands in streets each night justifiably protesting the ascension of a crotch grabbing racist con man to the White House would be well advised to not repeat the mistake of Occupy a few years ago. They and others who want to be relevant in this new era urgently need to put forth some concrete demands which if struggled for will make them opinion leaders, and if won will improve the lives of millions. Quality single payer health care NOW is one of those demands. 
Trump‚Äôs threat to dismantle Obamacare is an invitation for us to reopen the struggle for health care as a human right. And this time we know we‚Äôre struggling against Republicans AND Democrats.

Freedom Rider: How Not to Protest Trump,"2016 elections by BAR editor and senior columnist Margaret Kimberley 
Donald Trump‚Äôs many evils are manifest and obvious. But let‚Äôs stop pretending that some historical line has been crossed in U.S. political and social relations. ‚ÄúThe dictates of white supremacy are ever present and the numbers of white people who do anything serious about it are small.‚Äù Newly outraged Democrats act like they‚Äôve never seen a fascist. ‚ÄúThere is an ample supply of domestic fascists. They are the people who wear police uniforms.‚Äù Freedom Rider : How Not to Protest Trump by BAR editor and senior columnist Margaret Kimberley 
‚Äú There are many unique characteristics to the Donald Trump story but the institutional evils that permeate this country persist no matter who sits in the oval office. ‚Äù 
Thousands of progressives are taking to the streets in opposition to the Donald Trump presidency. After eight years of Obama induced slumber they awoke with quite a start. Many of these individuals and organizations protested as part of the anti-war, Occupy and Black Lives Matter movements, but others weren‚Äôt concerned about very much until the reality show host became president elect. 
The awful Hillary Clinton should be inaugurated the 45 th president of the United States because she won the popular vote. But for the second time in less than twenty years a Democrat preferred by the people will instead be an historical footnote. If nothing else the Electoral College is rightly condemned. 
But where else should protesters direct their anger? If they are concerned about fascism they could protest police killings, or United States government murders committed during numerous interventions abroad. They might have risen up against the mass incarceration state. The list of outrages that should get people moving is quite long. 
White liberals here in New York City didn‚Äôt care very much when black and brown residents were subjected to nearly one million police encounters. Mayor Bloomberg‚Äôs infamous stop and frisk program was a tailor made opportunity for public anger. Yet every poll indicated that white people were in favor of this very fascist 21 st century slave patrol. Those same people are now upset but what exactly has raised their ire? 
‚ÄúTrump is no more hostile to the rights of the press than Obama was.‚Äù 
They say they are concerned about the rights of undocumented people but they didn‚Äôt say much when Obama acted as the Deporter-in-Chief. The so-called Muslim registry of men from 25 countries under the auspices of the NSEERS program lasted from 2002 to 2011. That is to say during two years of the Obama administration. They may be concerned about climate change and Trump‚Äôs promise to end America‚Äôs participation in the most recent climate agreement. But that agreement allows for a rise in carbon production and thus in world temperatures. They would have been smarter to challenge the phony climate change process itself. 
They say they are afraid that Trump will muzzle the press. His shouting match with network executives should not be a cause for alarm. Eventually they‚Äôll start saying good things about him so he was foolish to be so hostile. But he is no more hostile to the rights of the press than Obama was. When he used the Espionage Act to punish leakers and whistle blowers many of the now distraught progressives didn‚Äôt say much. 
So what has gotten progressives so angry? There is nothing new about the so-called alt-right movement. There is always a way to brand white nationalism. They may be the Tea Party one day and alt-right the next but it all amounts to the same thing. The dictates of white supremacy are ever present and the numbers of white people who do anything serious about it are small. 
If the sight of naziesque salutes to Trump are upsetting just keep in mind that there is an ample supply of domestic fascists. They are the people who wear police uniforms. They may not ‚Äúhail Trump‚Äù or anyone else but they kill three people in this country every day. 
‚Äú Barack Obama and Eric Holder quite literally kept thousands of black people in jail who could have been freed.‚Äù 
Donald Trump should be given credit for providing so much low hanging fruit. His appointment of Jefferson Beauregard Sessions to the post of attorney general provides ready made ingredients for fear and anger. Sessions was once denied a federal judgeship in part because of racist remarks directed at a black attorney. And who can ignore the glorification of the Confederacy in his name. But what did Obama and his two black attorney generals do? There were no prosecutions of killer police. That fact is a curious one in the age of murder caught on video. The Obama Justice Department argued against giving the right to request resentencing for those convicted during the years of draconian drug crime prosecution. Barack Obama and Eric Holder quite literally kept thousands of black people in jail who could have been freed. 
It is difficult to take protesters seriously when they won‚Äôt even direct their anger at the party which displayed such gross incompetence during the recent campaign. The inability to defeat the man who seemed so unsuited to the presidency should stir anger towards the people whose hubris brought him to the White House. 
There is always a need to engage in struggle, whether a Republican or Democrat is president. There are many unique characteristics to the Donald Trump story but the institutional evils that permeate this country persist no matter who sits in the oval office. We can gauge the true level of concern about justice when a Democrat next emerges victorious. A president who provides a greater opportunity for scorn should not be the last one who faces opposition.

Obama's Departure is One Reason to Feel Optimism for Trump's Arrival,"2016 elections by Danny Haiphong 
Fears of Trump should not obscure the fact that Barack Obama‚Äôs reign was a disaster. ‚ÄúBlack America is in a worse condition than before, working class people as a whole have lost ground to a low-wage economy, and the world is closer to a World War III scenario than at any point prior.‚Äù The struggle continues, but ‚Äúit is important to ensure that the protests against Trump are not allowed to be channeled back into the Democratic Party graveyard.‚Äù Obama's Departure is One Reason to Feel Optimism for Trump's Arrival by Danny Haiphong 
‚ÄúOnly gridlock saved Social Security and Medicare from being privatized during his Presidency.‚Äù 
Thousands have taken to the streets across the country to protest Donald Trump's victory in the 2016 elections. The protests have mainly centered on Trump's racism, sexism, and anti-LGBTQ rhetoric spewed during his campaign. Protesters have yet to wrestle with Trump's positions on foreign policy and trade that made him a pariah to the majority of the ruling class. The struggle against capitalism and imperialism in the US remains immature even in the midst of positive growth in the movement against police brutality and racism in recent years. While Trump's overt bigotry gives cause for protest, there is one benefit of the Trump moment that should not be understated. That benefit is the much needed conclusion of the Obama era. 
Democrats across the US are in a state of mourning over the departure of Obama. Democrats heralded Obama as the quintessential professional and consummate politician. His celebrity was peppered by the appearance of intelligence and rationality in the face of so-called Republican ""obstructionism."" Obama's rule was advertised as a victory for the Black Freedom movement. His Administration possessed a vast marketing apparatus that defended him as the lesser-evil alternative to the racist vitriol of the White Man's Republican Party. 
‚ÄúObama's rule was advertised as a victory for the Black Freedom movement.‚Äù 
Black Agenda Report was one of the few on the left that warned of the dangers of Obama in 2008. Once elected, Obama became virtually untouchable. Criticisms of his policies were condemned as racist and insensitive to the needs of Black America. The needs of Black America and the entire left for that matter suddenly became aligned with whatever Obama did. Obama moved forward to protect the banks, escalate war, and erect the largest national security state ever assembled. He instantly became the austerity President, waging a war of privatization on public education with the expressed plans to do the same to Social Security. Only gridlock saved Social Security and Medicare from being privatized during his Presidency. 
The full scope of Obama's legacy has been discussed in earlier issues and will not be analyzed here. What is important is that the left will no longer have Obama to defend its alignment with US imperialism. No longer will the left be able to fall back on the first Black President to sanitize his record. Obama's immigration policies deported nearly 3 million undocumented immigrants with little protest. His Administration painted itself as a friend of women and LGBTQ identified people despite the fact that his policy of proxy and drone warfare murdered tens of thousands of women and children in Yemen, Syria, Libya, and Honduras. 
‚ÄúThe left will no longer have Obama to defend its alignment with US imperialism.‚Äù 
Obama was able to conduct a greater assault on oppressed people than the prior Bush Administration, making him the most effective evil Wall Street could buy. Obama took over as President in a period where the US was mired in two unpopular occupations abroad and an economic crisis at home. These conditions prompted the ruling class to choose Obama as the required form of counterinsurgency necessary to crush resistance before it started. After making a number of promises to end ""dumb wars"" and institute a single payer healthcare system, Obama entered office ready to the bidding of the ruling class. Eight years later, Black America is in a worse condition than before, working class people as a whole have lost ground to a low-wage economy , and the world is closer to a World War III scenario than at any point prior. 
The massive protests to Trump's victory are in part a release of popular energy brought on by the departure of Obama. Unrest began with the formation of the Occupy Wall Street and Black Lives Matter movements. However, neither of these movements articulated Obama's role in creating the conditions for social insurgency and movement. The 2016 elections changed the landscape dramatically. The Sanders and Trump campaigns set millions into motion in protest of the two-party establishment. Obama's departure will be another breath of fresh air into the internal rot of the imperialist system. It is thus important to ensure that the protests against Trump are not allowed to be channeled back into the Democratic Party graveyard. 
‚ÄúAfter making a number of promises to end ""dumb wars"" and institute a single payer healthcare system, Obama entered office ready to the bidding of the ruling class.‚Äù 
Obama will leave Trump a set of conditions that he cannot possibly maintain without popular unrest. Obama departs office only inches from World War III with Russia and China. Poverty and wealth inequality worsened under his administration . Not even clever distortions of statistics could hide the large number of workers currently unemployed or underemployed in the low-wage economy. School closures, food stamp cuts, and bank bailouts have unleashed the neo-liberal wasteland that Trump spoke about in his campaign. 
It appears early on that the left has rejected the viability of Trump's calls to regulate the banks and renegotiate trade deals in favor of working people. Many have ignored Trump‚Äôs ‚Äúpopulist‚Äù rhetoric and have focused all the energy of resistance on his white supremacist proposals to ban Muslims and deport millions of undocumented people. However, this moment is just as much about Obama's departure as it is Trump's arrival. The US imperialist system is facing multiple crises that relate directly back to the economic stagnation of global capitalism. It would be a mistake not to demand Trump stay true to his ‚Äúpopulism‚Äù just as it was a mistake when the left failed to demand Obama stay true to his promises. Whatever the case, the departure of Obama is a welcome site, and the left should use the room afforded by it to wage an intensified effort to build the organizational basis for social revolution in our time.

No More American Thanksgivings,"Thanksgiving by Glen Ford 
‚ÄúThe core ideological content of the holiday serves to validate all that has since occurred on these shores ‚Äì a national consecration of the unspeakable, a balm and benediction for the victors, a blessing of the fruits of murder and kidnapping, and an implicit obligation to continue the seamless historical project in the present day.‚Äù No More American Thanksgivings by Glen Ford 
This article originally appeared in the November 27, 2003 , issue of The Black Commentator, which Glen Ford co-founded and edited. 
Nobody but Americans celebrates Thanksgiving. It is reserved by history and the intent of ‚Äúthe founders‚Äù as the supremely white American holiday, the most ghoulish event on the national calendar. No Halloween of the imagination can rival the exterminationist reality that was the genesis, and remains the legacy, of the American Thanksgiving. It is the most loathsome, humanity-insulting day of the year ‚Äì a pure glorification of racist barbarity. 
We at are thankful that the day grows nearer when the almost four centuries-old abomination will be deprived of its reason for being: white supremacy. Then we may all eat and drink in peace and gratitude for the blessings of humanity‚Äôs deliverance from the rule of evil men. 
Thanksgiving is much more than a lie ‚Äì if it were that simple, an historical correction of the record of events in 1600s Massachusetts would suffice to purge the ‚Äúflaw‚Äù in the national mythology. But Thanksgiving is not just a twisted fable, and the mythology it nurtures is itself inherently evil. The real-life events ‚Äì subsequently revised ‚Äì were perfectly understood at the time as the first, definitive triumphs of the genocidal European project in New England. The near-erasure of Native Americans in Massachusetts and, soon thereafter, from most of the remainder of the northern English colonial seaboard was the true mission of the Pilgrim enterprise ‚Äì Act One of the American Dream. African Slavery commenced contemporaneously ‚Äì an overlapping and ultimately inseparable Act Two. 
The last Act in the American drama must be the ‚Äúroot and branch‚Äù eradication of all vestiges of Act One and Two ‚Äì America‚Äôs seminal crimes and formative projects. Thanksgiving as presently celebrated ‚Äì that is, as a national political event ‚Äì is an affront to civilization. 
Celebrating the unspeakable 
White America embraced Thanksgiving because a majority of that population glories in the fruits, if not the unpleasant details, of genocide and slavery and feels, on the whole, good about their heritage: a cornucopia of privilege and national power. Children are taught to identify with the good fortune of the Pilgrims. It does not much matter that the Native American and African holocausts that flowed from the feast at Plymouth are hidden from the children‚Äôs version of the story ‚Äì kids learn soon enough that Indians were made scarce and Africans became enslaved. But they will also never forget the core message of the holiday: that the Pilgrims were good people, who could not have purposely set such evil in motion. Just as the first Thanksgivings marked the consolidation of the English toehold in what became the United States, the core ideological content of the holiday serves to validate all that has since occurred on these shores ‚Äì a national consecration of the unspeakable, a balm and benediction for the victors, a blessing of the fruits of murder and kidnapping, and an implicit obligation to continue the seamless historical project in the present day. 
The Thanksgiving story is an absolution of the Pilgrims, whose brutal quest for absolute power in the New World is made to seem both religiously motivated and eminently human. Most importantly, the Pilgrims are depicted as victims ‚Äì of harsh weather and their own na√Øve yet wholesome visions of a new beginning. In light of this carefully nurtured fable, whatever happened to the Indians, from Plymouth to California and beyond, in the aftermath of the 1621 dinner must be considered a mistake, the result of misunderstandings ‚Äì at worst, a series of lamentable tragedies. The story provides the essential first frame of the American saga. It is unalloyed racist propaganda, a tale that endures because it served the purposes of a succession of the Pilgrims‚Äô political heirs, in much the same way that Nazi-enhanced mythology of a glorious Aryan/German past advanced another murderous, expansionist mission. 
Thanksgiving is quite dangerous ‚Äì as were the Pilgrims. 
Rejoicing in a cemetery 
The English settlers, their ostensibly religious venture backed by a trading company, were glad to discover that they had landed in a virtual cemetery in 1620. Corn still sprouted in the abandoned fields of the Wampanoags , but only a remnant of the local population remained around the fabled Rock. In a letter to England, Massachusetts Bay colony founder John Winthrop wrote, ""But for the natives in these parts, God hath so pursued them, as for 300 miles space the greatest part of them are swept away by smallpox which still continues among them. So as God hath thereby cleared our title to this place, those who remain in these parts, being in all not 50, have put themselves under our protection."" 
Ever diligent to claim their own advantages as God‚Äôs will, the Pilgrims thanked their deity for having ‚Äúpursued‚Äù the Indians to mass death. However, it was not divine intervention that wiped out most of the natives around the village of Patuxet but, most likely, smallpox-embedded blankets planted during an English visit or slave raid. Six years before the Pilgrim landing, a ship sailed into Patuxet‚Äôs harbor, captained by none other than the famous seaman and mercenary soldier John Smith , former leader of the first successful English colony in the New World, at Jamestown, Virginia. Epidemic and slavery followed in his wake, as Debra Glidden described in IMDiversity.com : 
In 1614 the Plymouth Company of England, a joint stock company, hired Captain John Smith to explore land in its behalf. Along what is now the coast of Massachusetts in the territory of the Wampanoag, Smith visited the town of Patuxet according to ""The Colonial Horizon,"" a 1969 book edited by William Goetzinan. Smith renamed the town Plymouth in honor of his employers, but the Wampanoag who inhabited the town continued to call it Patuxet. 
The following year Captain Hunt, an English slave trader, arrived at Patuxet. It was common practice for explorers to capture Indians, take them to Europe and sell them into slavery for 220 shillings apiece. That practice was described in a 1622 account of happenings entitled ""A Declaration of the State of the Colony and Affairs in Virginia,"" written by Edward Waterhouse. True to the explorer tradition, Hunt kidnapped a number of Wampanoags to sell into slavery. 
Another common practice among European explorers was to give ""smallpox blankets"" to the Indians. Since smallpox was unknown on this continent prior to the arrival of the Europeans, Native Americans did not have any natural immunity to the disease so smallpox would effectively wipe out entire villages with very little effort required by the Europeans. William Fenton describes how Europeans decimated Native American villages in his 1957 work ""American Indian and White relations to 1830."" From 1615 to 1619 smallpox ran rampant among the Wampanoags and their neighbors to the north. The Wampanoag lost 70 percent of their population to the epidemic and the Massachusetts lost 90 percent. 
Most of the Wampanoag had died from the smallpox epidemic so when the Pilgrims arrived they found well-cleared fields which they claimed for their own. A Puritan colonist, quoted by Harvard University's Perry Miller, praised the plague that had wiped out the Indians for it was ""the wonderful preparation of the Lord Jesus Christ, by his providence for his people's abode in the Western world."" 
Historians have since speculated endlessly on why the woods in the region resembled a park to the disembarking Pilgrims in 1620. The reason should have been obvious: hundreds, if not thousands, of people had lived there just five years before. 
In less than three generations the settlers would turn all of New England into a charnel house for Native Americans, and fire the economic engines of slavery throughout English-speaking America. Plymouth Rock is the place where the nightmare truly began. 
The uninvited? 
It is not at all clear what happened at the first ‚Äì and only ‚Äì ‚Äúintegrated‚Äù Thanksgiving feast. Only two written accounts of the three-day event exist, and one of them, by Governor William Bradford, was written 20 years after the fact. Was Chief Massasoit invited to bring 90 Indians with him to dine with 52 colonists, most of them women and children? This seems unlikely. A good harvest had provided the settlers with plenty of food, according to their accounts, so the whites didn‚Äôt really need the Wampanoag‚Äôs offering of five deer. What we do know is that there had been lots of tension between the two groups that fall. John Two-Hawks, who runs the Native Circle web site, gives a sketch of the facts: 
‚ÄúThanksgiving' did not begin as a great loving relationship between the pilgrims and the Wampanoag, Pequot and Narragansett people. In fact, in October of 1621 when the pilgrim survivors of their first winter in Turtle Island sat down to share the first unofficial 'Thanksgiving' meal, the Indians who were there were not even invited! There was no turkey, squash, cranberry sauce or pumpkin pie. A few days before this alleged feast took place, a company of 'pilgrims' led by Miles Standish actively sought the head of a local Indian chief, and an 11 foot high wall was erected around the entire Plymouth settlement for the very purpose of keeping Indians out!‚Äù 
It is much more likely that Chief Massasoit either crashed the party, or brought enough men to ensure that he was not kidnapped or harmed by the Pilgrims. Dr. Tingba Apidta, in his ‚Äú Black Folks‚Äô Guide to Understanding Thanksgiving ,‚Äù surmises that the settlers ‚Äúbrandished their weaponry‚Äù early and got drunk soon thereafter. He notes that ‚Äúeach Pilgrim drank at least a half gallon of beer a day, which they preferred even to water. This daily inebriation led their governor, William Bradford, to comment on his people's ‚Äònotorious sin,‚Äô which included their ‚Äòdrunkenness and uncleanliness‚Äô and rampant ‚Äòsodomy.‚Äô‚Äù 
Soon after the feast the brutish Miles Standish ‚Äúgot his bloody prize,‚Äù Dr. Apidta writes: 
‚ÄúHe went to the Indians, pretended to be a trader, then beheaded an Indian man named Wituwamat. He brought the head to Plymouth, where it was displayed on a wooden spike for many years, according to Gary B. Nash, ‚Äòas a symbol of white power.‚Äô Standish had the Indian man's young brother hanged from the rafters for good measure. From that time on, the whites were known to the Indians of Massachusetts by the name ‚ÄòWotowquenange,‚Äô which in their tongue meant cutthroats and stabbers.‚Äù 
What is certain is that the first feast was not called a ‚ÄúThanksgiving‚Äù at the time; no further integrated dining occasions were scheduled; and the first, official all-Pilgrim ‚ÄúThanksgiving‚Äù had to wait until 1637, when the whites of New England celebrated the massacre of the Wampanoag‚Äôs southern neighbors, the Pequots. 
The real Thanksgiving Day Massacre 
The Pequots today own the Foxwood Casino and Hotel , in Ledyard, Connecticut, with gross gaming revenues of over $9 billion in 2000. This is truly a (very belated) miracle, since the real first Pilgrim Thanksgiving was intended as the Pequot‚Äôs epitaph. Sixteen years after the problematical Plymouth feast, the English tried mightily to erase the Pequots from the face of the Earth, and thanked God for the blessing. 
Having subdued, intimidated or made mercenaries of most of the tribes of Massachusetts, the English turned their growing force southward, toward the rich Connecticut valley, the Pequot‚Äôs sphere of influence. At the point where the Mystic River meets the sea, the combined force of English and allied Indians bypassed the Pequot fort to attack and set ablaze a town full of women, children and old people. 
William Bradford, the former Governor of Plymouth and one of the chroniclers of the 1621 feast, was also on hand for the great massacre of 1637: 
""Those that escaped the fire were slain with the sword; some hewed to pieces, others run through with their rapiers, so that they were quickly dispatched and very few escaped. It was conceived they thus destroyed about 400 at this time. It was a fearful sight to see them thus frying in the fire...horrible was the stink and scent thereof, but the victory seemed a sweet sacrifice, and they gave the prayers thereof to God, who had wrought so wonderfully for them, thus to enclose their enemies in their hands, and give them so speedy a victory over so proud and insulting an enemy."" 
The rest of the white folks thought so, too. ‚ÄúThis day forth shall be a day of celebration and thanksgiving for subduing the Pequots,"" read Governor John Winthrop‚Äôs proclamation. The authentic Thanksgiving Day was born. 
Most historians believe about 700 Pequots were slaughtered at Mystic. Many prisoners were executed, and surviving women and children sold into slavery in the West Indies. Pequot prisoners that escaped execution were parceled out to Indian tribes allied with the English. The Pequot were thought to have been extinguished as a people. According to IndyMedia , ‚ÄúThe Pequot tribe numbered 8,000 when the Pilgrims arrived, but disease had brought their numbers down to 1,500 by 1637. The Pequot ‚ÄòWar‚Äô killed all but a handful of remaining members of the tribe.‚Äù 
But there were still too many Indians around to suit the whites of New England, who bided their time while their own numbers increased to critical, murderous mass. 
Guest‚Äôs head on a pole 
By the 1670s the colonists, with 8,000 men under arms, felt strong enough to demand that the Pilgrims‚Äô former dinner guests the Wampanoags disarm and submit to the authority of the Crown. After a series of settler provocations in 1675, the Wampanoag struck back, under the leadership of Chief Metacomet, son of Massasoit, called King Philip by the English. Metacomet/Philip, whose wife and son were captured and sold into West Indian slavery, wiped out 13 settlements and killed 600 adult white men before the tide of battle turned. A 1996 issue of the Revolutionary Worker provides an excellent narrative. 
In their victory, the settlers launched an all-out genocide against the remaining Native people. The Massachusetts government offered 20 shillings bounty for every Indian scalp, and 40 shillings for every prisoner who could be sold into slavery. Soldiers were allowed to enslave any Indian woman or child under 14 they could capture. The ""Praying Indians"" who had converted to Christianity and fought on the side of the European troops were accused of shooting into the treetops during battles with ""hostiles."" They were enslaved or killed. Other ""peaceful"" Indians of Dartmouth and Dover were invited to negotiate or seek refuge at trading posts ‚Äì and were sold onto slave ships. 
It is not known how many Indians were sold into slavery, but in this campaign, 500 enslaved Indians were shipped from Plymouth alone. Of the 12,000 Indians in the surrounding tribes, probably about half died from battle, massacre and starvation. 
After King Philip's War, there were almost no Indians left free in the northern British colonies. A colonist wrote from Manhattan's New York colony: ""There is now but few Indians upon the island and those few no ways hurtful. It is to be admired how strangely they have decreased by the hand of God, since the English first settled in these parts."" In Massachusetts, the colonists declared a ""day of public thanksgiving"" in 1676, saying, ""there now scarce remains a name or family of them [the Indians] but are either slain, captivated or fled."" 
Fifty-five years after the original Thanksgiving Day, the Puritans had destroyed the generous Wampanoag and all other neighboring tribes. The Wampanoag chief King Philip was beheaded. His head was stuck on a pole in Plymouth, where the skull still hung on display 24 years later. 
This is not thought to be a fit Thanksgiving tale for the children of today, but it‚Äôs the real story, well-known to the settler children of New England at the time ‚Äì the white kids who saw the Wampanoag head on the pole year after year and knew for certain that God loved them best of all, and that every atrocity they might ever commit against a heathen, non-white was blessed. 
There‚Äôs a good term for the process thus set in motion: nation-building. 
Roots of the slave trade 
The British North American colonists‚Äô practice of enslaving Indians for labor or direct sale to the West Indies preceded the appearance of the first chained Africans at the dock in Jamestown, Virginia, in 1619. The Jamestown colonists‚Äô human transaction with the Dutch vessel was an unscheduled occurrence. However, once the African slave trade became commercially established, the fates of Indians and Africans in the colonies became inextricably entwined. New England, born of up-close-and-personal, burn-them-in-the-fires-of-hell genocide, led the political and commercial development of the English colonies. The region also led the nascent nation‚Äôs descent into a slavery-based society and economy. 
Ironically, an apologist for Virginian slavery made one of the best, early cases for the indictment of New England as the engine of the American slave trade. Unreconstructed secessionist Lewis Dabney‚Äôs 1867 book ‚Äú A Defense of Virginia ‚Äù traced the slave trade‚Äôs origins all the way back to Plymouth Rock: 
The planting of the commercial States of North America began with the colony of Puritan Independents at Plymouth, in 1620, which was subsequently enlarged into the State of Massachusetts. The other trading colonies, Rhode Island and Connecticut, as well as New Hampshire (which never had an extensive shipping interest), were offshoots of Massachusetts. They partook of the same characteristics and pursuits; and hence, the example of the parent colony is taken here as a fair representation of them. 
The first ship from America, which embarked in the African slave trade, was the Desire , Captain Pierce, of Salem; and this was among the first vessels ever built in the colony. The promptitude with which the ""Puritan Fathers"" embarked in this business may be comprehended, when it is stated that the Desire sailed upon her voyage in June, 1637. [Note: the year they massacred the Pequots.] The first feeble and dubious foothold was gained by the white man at Plymouth less than seventeen years before; and as is well known, many years were expended by the struggle of the handful of settlers for existence. So that it may be correctly said, that the commerce of New England was born of the slave trade; as its subsequent prosperity was largely founded upon it. The Desire , proceeding to the Bahamas, with a cargo of ""dry fish and strong liquors, the only commodities for those parts,"" obtained the negroes from two British men-of-war, which had captured them from a Spanish slaver. 
Thus, the trade of which the good ship Desire , of Salem, was the harbinger, grew into grand proportions; and for nearly two centuries poured a flood of wealth into New England, as well as no inconsiderable number of slaves. Meanwhile, the other maritime colonies of Rhode Island and Providence Plantations, and Connecticut, followed the example of their elder sister emulously; and their commercial history is but a repetition of that of Massachusetts. The towns of Providence, Newport, and New Haven became famous slave trading ports. The magnificent harbor of the second, especially, was the favorite starting-place of the slave ships; and its commerce rivaled, or even exceeded, that of the present commercial metropolis, New York. All the four original States, of course, became slaveholding. 
The Revolution that exploded in 1770s New England was undertaken by men thoroughly imbued with the worldview of the Indian-killer and slave-holder. How could they not be? The ‚Äúcountry‚Äù they claimed as their own was fathered by genocide and mothered by slavery ‚Äì its true distinction among the commercial nations of the world. And these men were not ashamed, but proud, with vast ambition to spread their exceptional characteristics West and South and wherever their so-far successful project in nation-building might take them ‚Äì and by the same bloody, savage methods that had served them so well in the past. 
At the moment of deepest national crisis following the battle of Gettysburg in 1863, President Abraham Lincoln invoked the national fable that is far more central to the white American personality than Lincoln‚Äôs battlefield ‚ÄúAddress.‚Äù Lincoln seized upon the 1621 feast as the historic ‚ÄúThanksgiving‚Äù ‚Äì bypassing the official and authentic 1637 precedent ‚Äì and assigned the dateless, murky event the fourth Thursday in November. 
Lincoln surveyed a broken nation, and attempted nation-rebuilding, based on the purest white myth. The same year that he issued the Emancipation Proclamation, he renewed the national commitment to a white manifest destiny that began at Plymouth Rock. Lincoln sought to rekindle a shared national mission that former Confederates and Unionists and white immigrants from Europe could collectively embrace. It was and remains a barbaric and racist national unifier, by definition. Only the most fantastic lies can sanitize the history of the Plymouth Colony of Massachusetts. 
‚ÄùLike a rock‚Äù 
The Thanksgiving holiday fable is at once a window on the way that many, if not most, white Americans view the world and their place in it, and a pollutant that leaches barbarism into the modern era. The fable attempts to glorify the indefensible, to enshrine an era and mission that represent the nation‚Äôs lowest moral denominators . Thanksgiving as framed in the mythology is, consequently, a drag on that which is potentially civilizing in the national character, a crippling, atavistic deformity. Defenders of the holiday will claim that the politically-corrected children‚Äôs version promotes brotherhood, but that is an impossibility ‚Äì a bald excuse to prolong the worship of colonial ‚Äúforefathers‚Äù and to erase the crimes they committed. Those bastards burned the Pequot women and children, and ushered in the multinational business of slavery. These are facts. The myth is an insidious diversion ‚Äì and worse. 
Humanity cannot tolerate a 21st Century superpower, much of whose population perceives the world through the eyes of 17th Century land and flesh bandits. Yet that is the trick that fate has played on the globe. We described the roots of the planetary dilemma in our March 13 commentary, ‚Äú Racism & War, Perfect Together. ‚Äù 
The English arrived with criminal intent - and brought wives and children to form new societies predicated on successful plunder. To justify the murderous enterprise, Indians who had initially cooperated with the squatters were transmogrified into ""savages"" deserving displacement and death. The relentlessly refreshed lie of Indian savagery became a truth in the minds of white Americans, a fact to be acted upon by every succeeding generation of whites. The settlers became a singular people confronting the great ""frontier"" - a euphemism for centuries of genocidal campaigns against a darker, ""savage"" people marked for extinction. 
The necessity of genocide was the operative, working assumption of the expanding American nation. ""Manifest Destiny"" was born at Plymouth Rock and Jamestown, later to fall (to paraphrase Malcolm) like a rock on Mexico, the Philippines, Haiti, Nicaragua, etc. Little children were taught that the American project was inherently good, Godly, and that those who got in the way were ""evil-doers"" or just plain subhuman, to be gloriously eliminated. The lie is central to white American identity, embraced by waves of European settlers who never saw a red person. 
Only a century ago, American soldiers caused the deaths of possibly a million Filipinos whom they had been sent to ‚Äúliberate‚Äù from Spanish rule. They didn‚Äôt even know who they were killing, and so rationalized their behavior by substituting the usual American victims. Colonel Funston , of the Twentieth Kansas Volunteers, explained what got him motivated in the Philippines: 
""Our fighting blood was up and we all wanted to kill 'niggers.' This shooting human beings is a 'hot game,' and beats rabbit hunting all to pieces."" Another wrote that ""the boys go for the enemy as if they were chasing jack-rabbits .... I, for one, hope that Uncle Sam will apply the chastening rod, good, hard, and plenty, and lay it on until they come into the reservation and promise to be good 'Injuns.'"" 
Last week in northern Iraq another American colonel, Joe Anderson of the 101st Airborne (Assault) Division, revealed that he is incapable of perceiving Arabs as human beings. Colonel Anderson, who doubles as a commander and host of a radio call-in program and a TV show designed to win the hearts and minds of the people of Mosul, had learned that someone was out to assassinate him. In the wild mood swing common to racists, Anderson decided that Iraqis are all alike ‚Äì and of a different breed. He said as much to the Los Angeles Times . 
""They don't understand being nice,"" said Anderson, who helps oversee the military zone that includes Mosul and environs. He doesn't hide his irritation after months dedicated to restoring the city: ""We spent so long here working with kid gloves, but the average Iraqi guy will tell you, 'The only thing people respect here is violence‚Ä¶. They only understand being shot at, being killed. That's the culture.' ‚Ä¶ Nice guys do finish last here."" 
Col. Anderson personifies the unfitness of Americans to play a major role in the world, much less rule it. ""We poured a lot of our heart and soul into trying to help the people,‚Äù he bitched, as if Americans were God‚Äôs gift to the planet. ""But it can be frustrating when you hear stupid people still saying, 'You're occupiers. You want our oil. You're turning our country over to Israel.'‚Äù He cannot fathom that other people ‚Äì non-whites ‚Äì aspire to run their own affairs, and will kill and die to achieve that basic right. 
What does this have to do with the Mayflower? Everything. Although possibly against their wishes, the Pilgrims hosted the Wampanoag for three no doubt anxious days. The same men killed and enslaved Wampanoags immediately before and after the feast. They, their newly arrived English comrades and their children roasted hundreds of neighboring Indians alive just 16 years later, and two generations afterwards cleared nearly the whole of New England of its indigenous ‚Äúsavages,‚Äù while enthusiastically enriching themselves through the invention of transoceanic, sophisticated means of enslaving millions. The Mayflower‚Äôs cultural heirs are programmed to find glory in their own depravity, and savagery in their most helpless victims, who can only redeem themselves by accepting the inherent goodness of white Americans. 
Thanksgiving encourages these cognitive cripples in their madness, just as it is designed to do.",1
"Trump Says Go Back, We Say Fight Back","2016 elections by Robin D.G. Kelley 
The author writes: ‚ÄúI am not suggesting that white racism alone explains Trump‚Äôs victory. Nor am I dismissing the white working class‚Äôs very real economic grievances. It is not a matter of disaffection versus racism or sexism versus fear. Rather, racism, class anxieties, and prevailing gender ideologies operate together, inseparably, or as Kimberl√© Crenshaw would say, intersectionally.‚Äù Trump Says Go Back, We Say Fight Back by Robin D.G. Kelley 
This article previously appeared in Boston Review . 
‚ÄúWe need to reject a thoroughly bankrupt Democratic Party leadership that is calling for conciliation and, in Obama‚Äôs words, ‚Äúrooting for [Trump‚Äôs] success.‚Äù 
‚ÄúIf we are to keep the enormity of the forces aligned against us from establishing a false hierarchy of oppression, we must school ourselves to recognize that any attack against Blacks, any attack against women, is an attack against all of us who recognize that our interests are not being served by the systems we support. Each one of us here is a link in the connection between antipoor legislation, gay shootings, the burning of synagogues, street harassment, attacks against women, and resurgent violence against Black people.‚Äù ‚Äî Audre Lorde, ‚ÄúLearning from the 60s‚Äù 
Donald J. Trump‚Äôs election was a national trauma, an epic catastrophe that has left millions in the United States and around the world in a state of utter shock, uncertainty, deep depression, and genuine fear. The fear is palpable and justified, especially for those Trump and his acolytes targeted‚Äîthe undocumented, Muslims, anyone who ‚Äúlooks‚Äù undocumented or Muslim, people of color, Jews, the LGBTQ community, the disabled, women, activists of all kinds (especially Black Lives Matter and allied movements resisting state-sanctioned violence), trade unions. . . . the list is long. And the attacks have begun; as I write these words, reports of hate crimes and racist violence are flooding my inbox. 
The common refrain is that no one expected this. (Of course, the truth is that many people did expect this, just not in the elite media.) At no point, this refrain goes, could ‚Äúwe‚Äù imagine Trump in the Oval office surrounded by a cabinet made up of some of the most idiotic, corrupt, and authoritarian characters in modern day politics‚ÄîRudolph Giuliani, Chris Christie, Newt Gingrich, Sarah Palin, John Bolton, Ben Carson, Jeff Sessions, David ‚ÄúBlue Lives Matter‚Äù Clarke, Joe Arpaio, to name a few. Meanwhile, paid professional pundits are scrambling to peddle their analyses and to normalize the results‚Äîon the same broadcast media that helped deliver Trump‚Äôs victory by making him their ratings-boosting spectacle rather than attending to issues, ideas, and other candidates (e.g., Bernie Sanders or Jill Stein). They deliver the same old platitudes: disaffected voters, angry white men who have suffered economically and feel forgotten, Trump‚Äôs populist message represented the nation‚Äôs deep-seated distrust of Washington, ad infinitum. Some liberal pundits have begun to speak of President-Elect Trump as thoughtful and conciliatory, and some even suggest that his unpredictability may prove to be an asset. The protests are premature or misplaced. All of this from the same folks who predicted a Clinton victory. 
‚ÄúTrump‚Äôs followers are attracted to his wealth as metonym of an American dream that they, too, can enjoy once America is ‚Äògreat‚Äô again.‚Äù 
But the outcome should not have surprised us. This election was, among other things, a referendum on whether the United States will be a straight, white nation reminiscent of the mythic ‚Äúold days‚Äù when armed white men ruled, owned their castle, boasted of unvanquished military power, and everyone else knew their place. Henry Giroux‚Äôs new book America at War With Itself made this point with clarity and foresight two months before the election. The easy claim that Trump appeals to legitimate working-class populism driven by class anger, Giroux argues, ignores both the historical link between whiteness, citizenship, and humanity, and the American dream of wealth accumulation built on private property. Trump‚Äôs followers are not trying to redistribute the wealth, nor are they all ‚Äúworking class‚Äù‚Äîtheir annual median income is about $72,000. On the contrary, they are attracted to Trump‚Äôs wealth as metonym of an American dream that they, too, can enjoy once America is ‚Äúgreat‚Äù again‚Äîwhich is to say, once the country returns to being ‚Äúa white MAN‚Äôs country.‚Äù What Giroux identifies as ‚Äúcivic illiteracy‚Äù keeps them convinced that the descendants of unfree labor or the colonized, or those who are currently unfree, are to blame for America‚Äôs decline and for blocking their path to Trump-style success. 
For the white people who voted overwhelmingly for Trump, their candidate embodied the anti-Obama backlash. Pundits who say race was not a factor point to rural, predominantly white counties that went for Obama in 2008 and 2012, but now went for Trump, and to the low black and Latinx voter turnout. However, turnout was down overall, not just among African Americans. Post-election analysis shows that as a percentage of total votes the black vote dropped only 1 percent compared with the 2012 election, even while the number of black ballots counted decreased by nearly 11 percent. (Why this happened is beyond the scope of this essay, but one might begin with Greg Palast‚Äôs findings about voter suppression and the use of ‚Äúcrosscheck‚Äù to invalidate ballots.) Moreover, claims that nearly a third of Latinxs went for Trump have been disputed by the website Latino Decision, whose careful research puts the figure at 18 percent. The turnout does not contradict the fact that Trump drew the clear majority of white votes. This is not startling news. 
‚ÄúWe cannot ignore the fact that the vast majority of white men and a majority of white women, across class lines, voted for a platform and a message of white supremacy.‚Äù 
If history is our guide, ‚Äúwhitelash‚Äù usually follows periods of expanded racial justice and democratic rights. In the aftermath of Reconstruction, there were many instances in which southern white men switched from the biracial, abolitionist Republicans to the ‚Äúredeemers,‚Äù whether it be the Democrats or, in states like Texas, the ‚ÄúWhite Man‚Äôs Party.‚Äù (No ambiguity there.) Or in the 1880s and ‚Äô90s, when white Populists betrayed their Black Populist allies in a united struggle to redistribute railroad land grants to farmers, reduce debt by inflating currency, abolish private national banks, nationalize railroads and telegraphs, and impose a graduated income tax to shift the burden onto the wealthy, among other things. Many of these one-time white ‚Äúallies‚Äù joined the Ku Klux Klan, defeated the Lodge Force Bill of 1890 which would have authorized federal supervision of elections to protect black voting rights, and led the efforts to disfranchise black voters. Or the late 1960s, when vibrant struggles for black, brown, American Indian, Asian American, gay and lesbian, and women‚Äôs liberation, the anti-war movement, and student demands for a democratic revolution were followed by white backlash and the election of Richard Nixon‚Äîwhose rhetoric of ‚Äúlaw and order‚Äù and the ‚Äúsilent majority‚Äù Trump shamelessly plagiarized. 
Of course, Hilary Clinton did win the popular vote, and some are resorting to the easy lament that, were it not for the arcane Electoral College (itself a relic of slave power), we would not be here. One might add, too, that had it not been for the gutting of the Voting Rights Act opening the door for expanded strategies of voter suppression, or the permanent disfranchisement of some or all convicted felons in ten states, or the fact that virtually all people currently in cages cannot vote at all, or the persistence of misogyny in our culture, we may have had a different outcome. This is all true. But we cannot ignore the fact that the vast majority of white men and a majority of white women, across class lines, voted for a platform and a message of white supremacy, Islamophobia, misogyny, xenophobia, homophobia, anti-Semitism, anti-science, anti-Earth, militarism, torture, and policies that blatantly maintain income inequality. The vast majority of people of color voted against Trump, with black women registering the highest voting percentage for Clinton of any other demographic (93 percent). It is an astounding number when we consider that her husband‚Äôs administration oversaw the virtual destruction of the social safety net by turning welfare into workfare, cutting food stamps, preventing undocumented workers from receiving benefits, and denying former drug felons and users access to public housing; a dramatic expansion of the border patrol, immigrant detention centers, and the fence on Mexico‚Äôs border; a crime bill that escalated the war on drugs and accelerated mass incarceration; as well as NAFTA and legislation deregulating financial institutions. 
Still, had Trump received only a third of the votes he did and been defeated, we still would have had ample reason to worry about our future. 
‚ÄúWhite privilege is taken for granted to the point where it need not be named and can‚Äôt be named.‚Äù 
I am not suggesting that white racism alone explains Trump‚Äôs victory. Nor am I dismissing the white working class‚Äôs very real economic grievances. It is not a matter of disaffection versus racism or sexism versus fear. Rather, racism, class anxieties, and prevailing gender ideologies operate together, inseparably, or as Kimberl√© Crenshaw would say, intersectionally. White working-class men understand their plight through a racial and gendered lens. For women and people of color to hold positions of privilege or power over them is simply unnatural and can only be explained by an act of unfairness‚Äîfor example, affirmative action. White privilege is taken for granted to the point where it need not be named and can‚Äôt be named. So, as activist/scholar Bill Fletcher recently observed, even though Trump‚Äôs call to deport immigrants, close the borders, and reject free trade policies appealed to working-class whites‚Äô discontent with the effects of globalization, Trump‚Äôs plans do not amount to a rejection of neoliberalism. Fletcher writes, ‚ÄúTrump focused on the symptoms inherent in neoliberal globalization, such as job loss, but his was not a critique of neoliberalism. He continues to advance deregulation, tax cuts, anti-unionism, etc. He was making no systemic critique at all, but the examples that he pointed to from wreckage resulting from economic and social dislocation, resonated for many whites who felt, for various reasons, that their world was collapsing.‚Äù Yet Fletcher is quick not to reduce white working-class support for Trump to class fears alone, adding, ‚ÄúThis segment of the white population was looking in terror at the erosion of the American Dream, but they were looking at it through the prism of race.‚Äù 
A New York Times poll shows that Trump supporters identified immigration and terrorism, not the economy, as the two most important issues in the campaign. Immigration and terrorism are both about race‚ÄîMexicans and Muslims. That there are ‚Äúillegal‚Äù immigrants from around the globe, including Canada, Israel, and all over Europe doesn‚Äôt matter: anti-immigrant movements target those who can be racially profiled. And while Trump‚Äôs America fears ‚Äúterrorism,‚Äù it does not disavow homegrown terrorist organizations such as the Ku Klux Klan, despite the fact that white nationalist movements are responsible for the majority of violent terrorist attacks on U.S. soil. On the contrary, Trump was not only endorsed by white nationalists and U.S.-based fascists, but during the campaign he refused to renounce their support, and Trump‚Äôs leading candidate for attorney general, Rudy Giuliani, has openly called Black Lives Matter ‚Äúterrorists.‚Äù 
So where do we go from here? If we really care about the world, our country, and our future, we have no choice but to resist. We need to reject a thoroughly bankrupt Democratic Party leadership that is calling for conciliation and, in Obama‚Äôs words, ‚Äúrooting for [Trump‚Äôs] success.‚Äù Pay attention: Trump‚Äôs success means mass deportation; massive military spending; the continuation and escalation of global war; a conservative Supreme Court poised to roll back Roe v. Wade, marriage equality, and too many rights to name here; a justice department and FBI dedicated to growing the Bush/Obama-era surveillance state and waging COINTELPRO-style war on activists; fiscal policies that will accelerate income inequality; massive cuts in social spending; the weakening or elimination of the Affordable Care Act; and the partial dismantling and corporatization of government. 
What must resistance look like? There are at least five things we have to do right now: 
1. Build up the sanctuary movement. 
In the 1980s, when nearly one million refugees fled U.S.-backed dictatorships in Guatemala and El Salvador, churches offered shelter, sanctuary, and assistance to those seeking political asylum, and over thirty cities were subsequently designated ‚Äúsanctuary cities‚Äù by their local governments. The Obama administration‚Äôs deportations of undocumented workers rebooted the sanctuary movement, along with a vibrant immigrant rights movement that pushed the president to use executive authority to launch the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program and the Deferred Action for Parents of Americans and Lawful Permanent Residents (DAPA). Trump has vowed to end both programs, leaving some five million immigrants vulnerable to deportation and identifiable through their applications, and he has promised to immediately cut all federal funding for sanctuary cities. To those who argue that millions of undocumented people are not ‚Äúpolitical refugees,‚Äù I counter that Trump‚Äôs war on immigrants is driven entirely by his quest to take power‚Äîthey will become casualties of his political machinations. Some states have already outlawed the longstanding principle of sanctuary status, but this should not deter us from strengthening and expanding the sanctuary movement to other institutions. For example, many of us who work in the University of California system are working to turn our campuses into sanctuaries‚Äîpreferably with legal and administrative backing. But even without the law behind us, we must act on moral principle. 
2. Defend all of our targeted communities. 
We must defend against hate crimes, Islamophobia, anti-black racism, attacks on queer and trans people, and the erosion of reproductive rights. There is no need to reinvent the wheel since there are already hundreds of organizations across the country dedicated to the fight, including INCITE: Women of Color Against Violence, Radical Women, the Immigrant Solidarity Network, the Praxis Project, the Praxis Center, CAAAV: Organizing Asian Communities, the Coalition for Humane Immigrant Rights of Los Angeles (CHIRLA), the African American Policy Forum, the Network Against Islamophobia, and Causa Justa, to name only a few. One of the main targets of attack, of course, is the Movement for Black Lives, along with the dozens of organizations upon which it was built‚ÄîBlack Lives Matter, the Dream Defenders, Million Hoodies, Black Youth Project 100, Malcolm X Grassroots Movement, We Charge Genocide, and Black Organizing for Leadership and Dignity (BOLD), among others. We need to support these movements and institutions, financially and by doing the work. And we must defend the political and cultural spaces that enable us to plot, plan, build community and sustain social movements. Here in Los Angeles this means spaces such as the L.A. Black Workers Center, the Labor/Community Strategy Center and its new community space, Strategy and Soul, the L.A. Community Action Network, the Southern California Library for Social Studies and Research, the Community Coalition, and Revolutionary Autonomous Communities, among many others. In New York we can point to Decolonize This Place; in Detroit, the Boggs Center; in St. Louis, Organization for Black Struggle, and so on. There are literally hundreds of centers around the country building for local power, and while none were immune to state surveillance in the past, we can expect heightened monitoring and outright attacks under this extreme right-wing regime. Now is not the time to retreat to our identity silos. We need solidarity more than ever, recognizing that all solidarities are imperfect, often fragile, temporary, and always forged in struggle and sustained through hard work. In our state of emergency, political disagreements, slights, misunderstandings, and microaggressions should not prohibit us from fighting for peoples rights, privileges, and lives. 
3. Stop referring to the South as a political backwater, a distinctive site of racist right-wing reaction. 
First, white supremacy, homophobia, and anti-union attitudes are national, not regional, problems. Second, black and multiracial groups in the South are at the forefront of resisting Trump‚Äôs authoritarian agenda and building power outside the mainstream Democratic Party. Among them are Project South, Southerners on New Ground (SONG), the Moral Mondays Movement, Kindred: Southern Healing Justice Collective, Jackson Rising in Mississippi, Showing Up for Racial Justice (SURJ) in Louisville, Asian Americans Advancing Justice in Atlanta, and the Georgia Latino Alliance for Human Rights. 
The frontline battles that preceded Trump‚Äôs election must not be abandoned. On the contrary, they need to be strengthened. We must redouble our fight against the Dakota Access Pipeline and support the Standing Rock Sioux Nation‚Äôs historic resistance. There is no question that Trump‚Äôs election has further empowered the corporation behind the pipeline‚Äîthe Texas-based Fortune 500 company Energy Transfer Partners‚Äîto continue to build no matter what the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers or the Obama Justice Department says. We need to recognize Standing Rock as not only a struggle for environmental justice but an episode in Native people‚Äôs five-hundred-year resistance to colonialism. And speaking of colonialism, the crisis in Puerto Rico has not abated‚Äînot in the least. As I write, Puerto Ricans on the island and in the U.S. mainland are using every means at their disposal to resist PROMESA, the U.S. plan that empowers a seven-member, unelected board to impose austerity measures as a way of restructuring its debt‚Äîmeasures that include wage reductions, selling off public assets, altering retirement plans for public employees, and fast-tracking changes even if they violate existing laws. 
4. Support and deepen the anti-Klan and anti-fascist movement. 
We must especially support groups such as Southern Poverty Law Center, which has been on the frontlines of this movement for decades. Although the fight against white supremacist organizations has been continual since the 1860s, the federal government has never successfully outlawed the Klan and similar vigilante groups (although in the 1950s the state of Alabama succeeded in outlawing the NAACP). With Trump‚Äôs election we are likely to see a surge in white nationalist and other right-wing terrorism, including attacks on black churches, synagogues, mosques, abortion clinics; and against non-white, queer, and trans people and immigrants. Some on the left will argue that resisting the so-called ‚Äúalt-right‚Äù is a secondary issue since these are fringe movements and building class unity across racial lines ought to be our priority. But with the memory of Colorado Springs and Charleston seared into our memory, this argument rings hollow. And while President Obama‚Äôs poignant rendition of ‚ÄúAmazing Grace‚Äù at Reverend Clementa Pinckney‚Äôs funeral moved much of the nation, the truth is that it is easier to pass laws criminalizing organizations that support the boycott of businesses and institutions complicit in Israel‚Äôs illegal occupation of Palestine than it is to outlaw the Ku Klux Klan. 
5. Rebuild the labor movement. 
As obvious as this may seem, the entire labor movement is under attack on a global scale. Today labor unions are portrayed as corrupt, bloated, a drain on the economy, and modern-day cartels that threaten workers‚Äô ‚Äúliberty.‚Äù Corporations and the CEOs who run them are portrayed as the most efficient and effective mode of organization. In our neoliberal age, emergency financial managers are sent in to replace elected government during real or imagined economic crises; charter schools organized along corporate lines are replacing public schools; universities are being restructured along corporate lines with presidents increasingly functioning like CEOs; and a businessman with a checkered record, a history of improprieties and legal violations and allegations of sexual assault, and no experience whatsoever in government is elected president. 
Today‚Äôs economic debates focus not on alternatives to capitalism but on what kind of capitalism‚Äîcapitalism with a safety net for the poor or one driven by extreme free-market liberalization? A capitalism in which the state‚Äôs role is to bail out big banks and financial institutions, or one where the state imposes (or rather restores) greater regulation in order to avoid economic crises? In both of these scenarios, a weakened labor movement is a given. The once-powerful unions are doing little more than fighting to restore basic collective bargaining rights and deciding how much they are going to give back. Union leaders are struggling just to participate in crafting austerity measures. In the New Deal era, the state‚Äôs efforts to save capitalism centered on Keynesian strategies of massive state expenditures in infrastructure, job creation, a social safety net in the form of direct aid and social security, and certain protections for the right of unions to organize. All these measures were made possible by a strong labor movement. There was a level of militant organization that we did not see in our post-2008 collapse, in spite of Occupy Wall Street. While Occupy was massive, international, and built on preexisting social justice movements, it lacked the kind of institutional power base and political clout that organized labor had in the 1930s. Of course, labor unions have also been powerful engines of racial and gender exclusion, working with capital to impose glass ceilings and racially segmented wages, but the twenty-first-century labor movement has largely embraced principles of social justice, antiracism, immigrant rights, and cross-border strategies. 
‚ÄúI am talking about opening a path to freeing white people from the prison house of whiteness.‚Äù 
Obviously there is much missing here, like abolishing the Electoral College and continuing to wage a fight for local power in the legislative and electoral arenas as well as in the streets. Local campaigns to raise the minimum wage, for example, have not only produced key victories but served to mobilize people around issues of injustice and inequality. The sites of resistance will become clearer as the political situation becomes more concrete, especially after January 20. 
But I want to return to the white working class and how we might break the cycle of ‚Äúwhitelash.‚Äù First, we cannot change this country without winning over some portion of white working people, and I am not talking about gaining votes for the Democratic Party. I am talking about opening a path to freeing white people from the prison house of whiteness. True, with whiteness comes privilege, but many of the perceived privileges are inaccessible to most, which then generates resentment. Exposing whiteness for what it is‚Äîa foundational myth for the birth and consolidation of capitalism‚Äîis fundamental if we are to build a genuine social movement dedicated to dismantling the oppressive regimes of racism, heteropatriarchy, empire, and class exploitation that is at the root of inequality, precarity, materialism, and violence in many forms. I am not suggesting we ignore their grievances, but that we help white working people understand the source of their discontent‚Äîreal and imagined. 
Is this possible? The struggle to recruit the white working class is an old story. Black movement leaders have been trying to free white working people from the paltry wages of whiteness since Reconstruction, at least, and it seems to always end badly. This history is not necessarily legible because we tend to conflate populism and fascism with what Henry Giroux astutely identifies as authoritarianism. Populism is the idea that ordinary people ought to have the power to control their government and their communities, especially along lines that benefit the collective. In the 1880s and ‚Äô90s, the black populist movement adopted a vision of a new society based on cooperative economics. The great writer and activist Timothy Thomas Fortune gave their unique vision eloquent voice and plans for action in his book Black and White: Land, Labor and Politics in the South (1884), which offered a path for the emancipation of the nation as a whole, not just black people. He attacked America‚Äôs betrayal of Reconstruction, identified monopoly and private ownership of land as the central source of inequality, and articulated a vision of a democratic, caring political economy based on equity and fairness. The National Colored Alliance members had advanced beyond printing more money or demanding free silver, adopting instead a more radical redistribution of wealth and power. They wanted more than a short-term alliance just to raise wages for picking cotton or reducing debt. But Fortune understood that a genuine cooperative commonwealth is not possible unless white workers and farmers join the movement. ‚ÄúThe hour is approaching,‚Äù he wrote, ‚Äúwhen the laboring classes of our country, North, East, West and South, will recognize that they have a common cause, a common humanity and a common enemy; and that, therefore, if they would triumph over wrong and place the laurel wreath upon triumphant justice, without distinction of race or of previous condition they must unite!‚Äù Whatever unity they managed to create proved ephemeral. As in so many other scenarios, most whites chose white supremacy over liberation. 
The lessons here are crucial. We cannot build a sustainable movement without a paradigm shift. Stopgap, utilitarian alliances to stop Trump aren‚Äôt enough. I concur with Giroux, who calls on all of us to wage ‚Äúan anti-fascist struggle that is not simply about remaking economic structures, but also about refashioning identities, values, and social relations as part of a democratic project that reconfigures what it means to desire a better and more democratic future.‚Äù Robin Davis Gibran Kelley is the Gary B.
