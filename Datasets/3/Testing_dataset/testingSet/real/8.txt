Port Perry dogs poisoned with antifreeze
A popular Port Perry park was closed when several dogs became sick after eating cupcakes apparently laced with antifreeze today.

Durham Police were called to Poplar Park on Ash St. around 11:30 p.m. after three dog owners took their pets to a clinic and were diagnosed as being poisoned. The dogs had been in the park earlier Monday evening and had eaten cupcakes found on the ground near a tree.

The dogs are in a stable condition, said Durham police spokesperson Dave Selby.

A veterinarian said the animals had ingested a "poison-like antifreeze injected into the cupcakes," said Selby.

Police are currently at Poplar Park and have searched other nearby parks, but have found no other poisonous food. The park is expected to open sometime today.

"I don't remember it (poisoning) happening in years and years," Selby said.

About six dogs were poisoned in Toronto's High Park last summer, two of them fatally.

Toronto Police recovered a bag of flax bread from the park, believed to be soaked in antifreeze.
