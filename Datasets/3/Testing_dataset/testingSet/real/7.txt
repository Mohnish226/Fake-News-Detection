1.15 Million Americans Have Been Killed by Guns Since John Lennon’s Death
Some 1.15 million people have been killed by firearms in the United States since Lennon was gunned down, according to data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, confirmed by New Yorkers Against Gun Violence. (The figure includes estimates for the two most recent years.)

Since 1968 — the year the Beatles released the White Album — more Americans have been killed by gun violence than in all U.S. wars throughout history, combined.

Hillary Clinton was in Florida last week, giving a speech citing the staggering statistics about American gun violence, as the San Bernardino shooting was taking place. 

“Ninety Americans a day die from gun violence, homicide, suicides, tragic avoidable accidents — 33,000 Americans a year die,” Clinton told the crowd. “It is time for us to say we are going to have comprehensive background checks, we are gonna close the gun show loopholes.”
