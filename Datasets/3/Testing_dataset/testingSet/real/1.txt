Best Buy has announced they will be using “Happy Holidays” this coming Christmas shopping season, and they will not be using “Merry Christmas.”
Dawn Bryant, a spokeswoman at Best Buy Co. Inc., says their advertising will not be using the term “Merry Christmas.”

“We are going to continue to use the term holiday because there are several holidays throughout that time period, and we certainly need to be respectful of all of them,” Bryant said. Click here for reference article.

While many other retailers have decided to return to the traditional “Merry Christmas”, Best Buy will not be among them. Best Buy considers the use of “Merry Christmas” to be disrespectful.
