Country Music Legend Willie Nelson Dies at Age 81
Legendary country music star Willie Nelson was found dead today in his Maui home. He was 81 years old. Rumors of Nelson’s death first circulated early July 21, 2015 on social media outlets but was later confirmed by police.

A groundskeeper scheduled to perform yard maintenance on Nelson’s property reportedly found the singer/songwriter unresponsive on the front lawn and immediately called 911.

“There was no evidence of drug abuse or alcohol and no signs of foul play,” said Det. Aldeson.

“Determining an official cause of death could take as long as 3 weeks,” said County Coroner Frank Shultz. “It’s just too early to tell what caused his tragic death.”

The shocking news comes just days after a recent “60 Minutes” interview where Nelson was quoted as saying “Life is good and I have never felt better or been happier.”

This story is still developing and all information is not yet officially verified.
