Kim Kardashian Changed Her Password Again After Kanye West Used Her Phone To Tweet
The beef between Kanye West and Drake is far from over, just hours after Kanye West appeared to settle their beef, the Chicago rapper hopped back on Twitter with over 80 tweets, claiming Drake “called trying to threatened me.” Kanye West Tweeted “So drake if anything happens to me or anyone from my family you are the first suspect— So cut the tough talk,”.
Kanye even went as far as saying Drake wouldn’t even be where he is today without him.
“I’m the guy with the pink polo that made a way for him,” Kanye wrote. “There would never be a drake without a Kanye west so never come out your mouth with a threat.”
Kanye’s phone must’ve died from tweeting so much that he took Kim Kardashians phone and tweeted pretending to be her but she later tweeted “DAMN NOW I GOTTA CHANGE MY PASSWORD AGAIN” giving us the assumption that it was Kanye West was tweeting and not Kim herself.
