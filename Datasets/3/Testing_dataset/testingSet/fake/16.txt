Hobby Lobby Stones Gay Employee to Death
Managers at a Hobby Lobby store in Arkansas stoned to death an employee today for being gay.

According to a report in the Ozark Post-Gazette, the store’s management decided to execute Jeremy Gleason, 43, in an alley behind the store in accordance with the Biblical verseLeviticus 20:13, which commands believers to kill homosexual men.

The assailants reportedly tied Gleason to a pole and threw large chunks of granite and whole bricks at his body. An autopsy later revealed the adoptive father of 2 young children died of blunt force trauma to the head.

Although Gleason’s family have called for Hobby Lobby’s managers to be charged with murder, police say they do not intend to make any arrests in the case because the store was simply exercising its religious beliefs.

“I don’t really see the problem here,” says Mark Patterson, Wilson County sheriff, “I mean stoning gays to death is in the Bible. And Hobby Lobby is a Christian company.

“What am I supposed to do? Arrest the people who killed him? Last I checked this was America. We don’t put people in jail for exercising their religion.”

Gleason’s unusual execution comes just days after the US Supreme Court ruled that his employer may be exempted from a federal law requiring employers to provide contraceptive coverage to their employees.
