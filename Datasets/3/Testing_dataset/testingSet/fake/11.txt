Bart Simpson elected mayor of LA town
The Simpsons star Nancy Cartwright has been elected mayor of Northridge in Los Angeles.

Cartwright, who voices tearaway child Bart Simpson in the cartoon series, is determined to make her mark following her election victory on Tuesday and plans to clamp down on rampaging youths immediately.

The 47-year-old mother-of-two says: "Everyone finds it funny that Bart is the new mayor. I can influence people because I'm Bart Simpson.

"I live in a nice neighbourhood. But down the road there's drugs and gangs, stealing and illiteracy."
