First Lady Michelle Obama to Propose National Hug a Muslim Day
First Lady Michelle Obama will unveil a proposal Monday that she hopes will ease tensions and work to counteract an ever growing Islamophobia gripping the nation. In an effort to strengthen relations and help build mutual trust with our two million Muslim Americans citizens, Michelle Obama is set to propose national “Hug a Muslim Day”.
The proposed new federal holiday would eliminate and replace Columbus Day, first observed as a state holiday in 1906, and became federal in 1937. From now on, every second Monday in October would be recognized and observed as national, “Hug a Muslim Day.”

The proposed new federal holiday is already drawing mixed reactions from Americans, and conservatives warn this is just another step in the Obama Administration’s pledge to “fundamentally transform” America.
