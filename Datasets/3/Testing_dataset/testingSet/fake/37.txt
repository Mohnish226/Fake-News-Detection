Have Residents of Clint, Texas, been forcibly implanted with microchips by Jade Helm operatives?
People in the town of Clint, Texas are reporting that American soldiers have rounded up hundreds of civilians and forced them to submit to RFID implantation.

Currently Jade Helm 15 is operating just miles outside of Clint, Texas, leaving many to wonder if the two are related.

Jade Helm has been steeped in controversy since it was first announced by the military on March 23 2015, and concerned Texans have been on high alert for a potential gun-grab, or martial law scenario ever since. The governor of Texas has even deployed the National Guard to defend against any potential hostile takeover attempts. The US government has described Jade Helm as a military training exercise which focuses on specific terrains, but folks remain skeptical, and with good reason.

Several eye witness reports state that residents in the small town were rounded up and brought to an abandoned shopping mall in the area. There they were given the choice between RFID implantation, or imprisonment in the makeshift military base.
