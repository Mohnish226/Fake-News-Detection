Wi-Fi Microscopes Help Texas Students With Science


CORPUS CHRISTI, Texas (AP) - Once students began opting to trade in precious recess time for more time in the classroom, Teri Gonzalez knew the school's investment had paid off. 
"If it helps them to begin nurturing that love for science, I'm willing to allow them more time to learn," the fifth-grade teacher at Magee Elementary School said.

The Corpus Christi Caller-Times (http://bit.ly/2gdcS3V) reports the investment comes in the form of 57 Wi-Fi microscopes purchased by officials at the school for its K-5 student curriculum.
