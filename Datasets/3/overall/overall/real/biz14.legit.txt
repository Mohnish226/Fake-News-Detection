Amazon has made its first move into the Middle East after agreeing to buy the region's largest online retailer  Souq.com  for an undisclosed amount. Souq was launched in 2005 and offers more than 8.4 million products. It sells across 31 categories including consumer electronics  fashion  health and beauty  household goods and baby. "Amazon and Souq share the same DNA. We're driven by customers  invention and long-term thinking  said Amazon senior vice-president Russ Grandinetti. Some reports have suggested Amazon is paying about $650m (£517m) for the company. The deal was revealed a day after Emaar Malls, the operator of Dubai's biggest mall, made an offer of $800m (£636m) for Souq.
