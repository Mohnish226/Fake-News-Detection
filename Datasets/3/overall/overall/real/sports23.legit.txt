 F1: Resurgent Ferrari finally takes fight to Mercedes

The champagne flowed  cheers rang out and "il Tricolore" flags were enthusiastically waved. But behind the scenes there was probably a huge collective sigh of relief. Sebastian Vettel's win at Sunday's Australian Grand Prix has been a long time coming for Ferrari -- Formula One's most successful team. The 16-time world champion hadn't won in Melbourne since 2007 and its last victory of any description came back in 2015  when Vettel won the Singapore Grand Prix.
