Exchange students say U.S. high schools easier and puzzle over all the sports


A funny thing happened on the way to making U.S. high schools harder: The rest of the industrialized world made theirs even harder.

A new survey of foreign exchange students who spent time in U.S. high schools last year finds that nine in 10 of them think school back home is more challenging. And the percentage who think so has grown.

That's according to a new study out Wednesday from the Brookings Institution's Brown Center on Education Policy. Researcher Tom Loveless in 2001 surveyed foreign exchange students, then revisited the questions in 2016. He found that the new crop of students believe more strongly that school here is easier than in their native country - and that students here don't work as hard.
