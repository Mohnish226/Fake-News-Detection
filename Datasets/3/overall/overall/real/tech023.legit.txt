Following YouTube gaffe, AT&T, Verizon may pull most of their ads from Google

After their ads appeared next to extremist content on YouTube, telecom companies AT&T and Verizon said they were going to pull their ads from the video site. But the fallout may go further than just YouTube.

Google's Chief Business Officer Phillip Schindler issued an apology on the company's blog on Monday, saying the practice is unacceptable. "We know that this is unacceptable to the advertisers and agencies who put their trust in us," Schindler wrote in the blog statement.
