Betsy DeVos's Education Hearing Erupts Into Partisan Debate


WASHINGTON - At her confirmation hearing on Tuesday to be education secretary, Betsy DeVos vigorously defended her work steering taxpayer dollars from traditional public schools, arguing that it was time to move away from a "one size fits all" system and toward newer models for students from preschool to college.

The hearing quickly became a heated and partisan debate that reflected the nation's political divide on how best to spend public money in education.
