Netflix is testing a 'Skip Intro' button, and viewers love it

No more watching the same minute-long intro song and credits before every episode of "Orange is the New Black." Netflix told CNNMoney Friday that some Netflix members recently began seeing a "Skip Intro" button while streaming, but wouldn't say when it first appeared.  

Netflix  spokesperson Smita Saran said the feature is one of "hundreds" of A-B tests that the company conducts each year to try out new features. "We're looking at what does or doesn't enhance the viewing experience," Saran said.
