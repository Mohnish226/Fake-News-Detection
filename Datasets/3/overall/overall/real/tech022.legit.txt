GPS device to prevent false Everest claims by climbers

Nepal will provide GPS tracking devices to some mountaineers who attempt to scale Mount Everest this year to prevent them from making false summit claims and to track climbers in distress, an official said on Monday.

Climbers who reach the 8,850-metre (29,035-feet) Everest summit must produce photographs showing them at the top as proof of their ascent, as well as a report from their liaison official who stays at base camp.

The government banned an Indian couple from mountaineering in Nepal for 10 years last year after they faked a photograph to show them atop the world's tallest peak.
