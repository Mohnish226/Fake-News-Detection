U.S. Travel Industry Fears a 'Lost Decade' Under Trump


Like many Washington lobby groups, the U.S. Travel Association was quick to congratulate the new president on his victory last November.

"We are encouraged that Mr. Trump's extensive business and hospitality background ...will make him a ready and receptive ear," the trade organization said. On the Republican's inauguration, the USTA's chief executive officer, Roger Dow, pledged the industry as a "capable, willing partner."

But almost immediately things started to go sideways. A steady drumbeat of news and policy proclamations seemed likely to damage America's $250 billion travel industry and its roughly 15 million U.S. employees.
