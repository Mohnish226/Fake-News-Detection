Toyota teams up with Microsoft to bring voice recognition to cars


Toyota owes Microsoft a big ol' "thank you" when it comes to the future of the automaker's connected cars.

Microsoft will license a good deal of its connected car patents to Toyota, Automotive News reports. Toyota will have access to a number of intellectual properties covering operating systems, voice recognition, artificial intelligence and gesture control. It has not been disclosed how much money Toyota paid for this access, but it probably wasn't cheap.
