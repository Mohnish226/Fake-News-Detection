Good news for fans hopelessly devoted to "Grease" stars John Travolta and Olivia Newton-John. Newtwon-John told Britain's The Mirror that a reunion could be in the works next year to mark the 1978 film's 40th anniversary. The Australian actress and singer  68  confirmed that she and Travolta have been discussing ideas for a reunion  but she didn't divulge any details. Speaking ahead of the Fame Awards at Hard Rock Live in Las Vegas  where she was receiving the Icon Award  Newton-John told The Mirror  "We are thinking up ways. Nothing to announce yet." "Forty years anniversary of 'Grease ' which I can't believe  she continued. Time goes so fast. It is so exciting." Marking the 40th anniversary could be one of Newton-John's last performances before she retires from 50 years in show business. "As time goes on I think of doing less and having more time off  she said. But it wouldn't be the first time the thought has crossed her mind. Every year for the last 20 years  I thought I was retiring and then somebody would say  'How about this?' and it's like  'Oh  that looks fun ' or 'How about this?'" Newton-John admitted. "Things that I would never think about."
