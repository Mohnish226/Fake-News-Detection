 The writing on the wall

A new exhibition explores the history of modern urban graffiti - from its roots in the inner cities of Philadelphia and New York  through to the present day global graffiti movement. Masters of Invention - at the Lettering Arts Centre in Suffolk - looks at the emergence of simple personal tags in the late 1960s  to highly intricate contemporary forms of this urban art. It is curated by Errol Donald - a former graffiti artist whose work below was displayed in the UK's first exhibition dedicated to graffiti  in Bristol  more than 30 years ago.
