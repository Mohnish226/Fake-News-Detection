Lewis Hamilton believes he can beat Sebastian Vettel to world title

Britain's Lewis Hamilton says he is confident he can beat Sebastian Vettel to the world title this year despite defeat at the Australian Grand Prix. Hamilton finished second to the German in the season opener in Melbourne after losing the lead following pressure from the Ferrari driver's superior pace. Hamilton said: "It is going to be a close race. I truly believe we can beat them. It's great to see Ferrari there. "It's good we had this close battle. I'm looking forward to the next." Hamilton led from pole position but struggled for pace in the opening laps and after an early pit stop was held up by Red Bull's Max Verstappen  allowing Vettel to get ahead. Hamilton said: "I wouldn't say I'm happy. But all things in perspective. To see where we have come from  with massive rule changes and to come here and be battling so close for a win and missing out marginally  there are a lot of things to be proud of. "We could have won the race but I gave it everything I could and you can't do more. Take the strength of the weekend."
