Macron and Le Pen Spar

Anticipating French Election Runoff  "With more than three weeks still to go before the first round of voting  Marine Le Pen and Emmanuel Macron are already campaigning like they were the only candidates left in the race to become France's next president. With most recent polls suggesting anti-euro Le Pen and the centrist Macron are more than five points ahead of their nearest challenger for the two slots in the May 7 runoff  the front-runners traded barbs over the weekend as the other candidates faded into the background. Macron called Le Pen a "a liar" over a pledge to eliminate immigration  while the nationalist portrayed her rival as a puppet of the French elite. On Europe 1 radio on Monday  she said he's soft on migration.
