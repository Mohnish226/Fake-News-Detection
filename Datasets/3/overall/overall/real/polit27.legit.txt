Meet James Robart, the judge who halted Trump's immigration ban


The federal judge who blocked President Trump's immigration ban spent more than 30 years in private practice before taking the bench, giving up a lucrative career that saw him representing breweries, energy companies and Southeast Asian immigrants.

Trump tweeted Saturday morning that he thought U.S. District Senior Judge James Robart's temporary restraining order was "ridiculous," and declared it would be overturned.

Robart, who Trump demeaned as a "so-called judge," was appointed to the bench by President George W. Bush in 2004 after receiving unanimous support from the U.S. Senate.
