 Channel 4 'could move out of London'

Proposals on whether to move Channel 4 out of London will be considered as part of a government consultation. Plans to privatise the TV company have been shelved  but where it spends its money is also under review  Culture Secretary Karen Bradley has announced. She said the government wants "the benefits of this national asset to be spread far and wide  not just in London". Channel 4 said a "substantial relocation would be highly damaging". The government carried out an 18-month review of the publicly-owned channel  which has more than 800 staff but fewer than 30 based outside central London. Ms Bradley will outline the consultation plans at the Nations and Regions Media Conference in Salford on Wednesday.
