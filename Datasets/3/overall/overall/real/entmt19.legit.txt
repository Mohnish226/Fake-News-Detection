Ex-Fox News CFO offered immunity in Roger Ailes investigation

The federal investigation stemming from sexual harassment allegations made against former Fox News chief Roger Ailes took a dramatic turn on Tuesday with a report that prosecutors have offered a former network executive immunity. Mark Kranz  Fox News' chief financial officer until his retirement last August  has been offered immunity from prosecution in exchange for his cooperation with the investigation  two sources with knowledge of the matter confirmed to CNNMoney. The investigation centers on questions about whether 21st Century Fox misled investors by hiding payments to Fox News employees who alleged that they were sexually harassed by Ailes. As CFO  Kranz was directly involved in preparing the company's financial statements and is thus potentially a key witness in the investigation  the sources said. Kranz's lawyer declined to comment on the matter. Spokespeople for the Department of Justice and the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York  which is handling the investigation  also declined to comment.
