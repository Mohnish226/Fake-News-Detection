Brexit talks will fail without compromise: José Manuel Barroso

Brexit negotiations are on course to fail unless both Britain and the European Union ditch their winner-takes-all approach to the coming talks  the former president of the European commission José Manuel Barroso has said. With just days to go before Theresa May formally notifies Brussels of the UK's intention to leave the EU  Jean-Claude Juncker's predecessor said the two sides were playing a dangerous game. The UK's prime minister has said she believes "no deal is better than a bad deal"  and some in her cabinet have openly talked up the prospect of walking away from the negotiating table.
