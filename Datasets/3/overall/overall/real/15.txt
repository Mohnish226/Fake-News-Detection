Starbucks’ ‘Collapse into Cool’ Campaign
There appears to be no limit on what Starbucks will do to capitalize on the misforturnes of others.
A regular contributor to one of the online forums I participate in was appalled to walk into the Starbucks nearest the WTC site and see the attached poster on a wall. He complained to the staff and was basically told to get lost.

This is the same Starbucks that charged EMT workers $130 for water immediately following the collapse of the towers. (Note that word “collapse.”)

He wrote to the group about his experience and other members across the country went to their local Starbucks and saw the poster. Many were disgusted while others didn’t see what the fuss was about. Eventually, though, enough people from the group (as well as others) wrote and called to Starbucks national headquarters in Seattle that they announced last week that local stores have been instructed to take down the poster.

I not only understand what upset everyone but I think it is disgusting and between this and Starbucks’ behavior on September 11, I will never go there again. What do you think?
