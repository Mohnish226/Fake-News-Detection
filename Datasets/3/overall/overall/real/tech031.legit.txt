Instagram adds two-factor authentication, security features

Instagram just made your account harder to hack.

On Thursday, Instagram added two-factor authentication to the photo- and video-sharing social network, increasing security measures for its 600 million active users.

You can activate two-factor authentication by going to your settings and turning on the feature.

Twitter, Facebook and Google already offer two-factor authentication.
