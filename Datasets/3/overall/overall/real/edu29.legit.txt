STEM Students Create Winning Invention

STREAMWOOD, Ill. (AP) -- It's a small generator that could power a small light, but the invention could pay some big dividends for a group of Streamwood High School students.

Their wind-powered generator idea won the state competition in the Samsung Solve for Tomorrow contest, which encourages teachers and students to solve real-world issues using classroom skills in science, technology, engineering, arts and mathematics. The 16 students will compete this spring for 10 national finalist slots and ultimately a prize of up to $200,000.
