Body Is Mistaken for a Halloween Display
LOS ANGELES — The body of a man slumped over patio furniture on his balcony in Marina del Rey was mistaken for Halloween décor last week and remained undisturbed for five days.

Sheriff’s deputies were called to the complex Thursday evening and found the man, Mostafa Mahmoud Zayed, 75, dead. He had been shot through the eye.

“He looked fake,” said Austin Raishbrook, 33, who lives nearby. “It looked like somebody had thrown a dummy over the back of a chair.”

Sheriff’s deputies believe that Mr. Zayed committed suicide, said Steve Whitmore, a spokesman for the Los Angeles County Sheriff’s Department. “Our investigators don’t think there was any foul play here,” he said.

Mr. Raishbrook said he had just returned home from work at the news-gathering agency he owns when sirens began to wail along Bora Bora Way, a residential street overlooking boat slips and a main waterway.

“I ran over there with my camera equipment,” he said. “There was blood on the balcony, and he was visible from the street. But it really did not look like a real person up there.”

The coroner’s autopsy report, released Saturday, showed that Mr. Zayed probably died last Sunday. Mr. Whitmore said neighbors “reported hearing popping noises on Sunday.”

Most people in the complex of 800 units may not have noticed Mr. Zayed, Mr. Whitmore said. Hard rain and cold winds kept many indoors for most of the week. The buildings in the complex are turned so that the third floor — where Mr. Zayed’s body was slouched toward a railing — is partly obscured from the street.

“I finally took a walk last night with my dog, and I saw the ambulance there,” said Victoria Sepe, 61, who lives nearby but did not see the body. “It’s terrible.”

The apartment complex sits on a narrow strip of land leading to the sea, said residents reached on the phone Friday. It is a quiet street, they said, with upscale apartment buildings.

The most pressing security matters are usually “seals jumping on the docks and making too much noise,” Ms. Sepe said.

“This is a little creepy,” she added.
