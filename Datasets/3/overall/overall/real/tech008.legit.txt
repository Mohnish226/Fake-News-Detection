Are Autonomous Cars Ready to Go It Alone?

Training wheels for autonomous vehicles come in the shape of a human behind the wheel. But when you remove the safety driver from a robotic car, two tons of metal is let loose.

The cars would be required to have a remote operator capable of keeping an eye on the car, but nevertheless, as the Guardian correctly points out, the news feels like a defining moment for the technology. Has it matured enough to finally let us place our faith in the ability of the robot?
