 House sends bill rolling back Internet privacy protections to Trump

Congress sent proposed legislation to President Trump on Tuesday that wipes away landmark online privacy protections  the first salvo in what is likely to become a significant reworking of the rules governing Internet access in an era of Republican dominance.  In a party-line vote  House Republicans freed Internet service providers such as Verizon  AT&T and Comcast from restrictions approved just last year that had sought to limit what companies could do with information such as customer browsing habits  app usage history  location data and Social Security numbers. The rules had also required providers to strengthen safeguards for customer data against hackers and thieves.
