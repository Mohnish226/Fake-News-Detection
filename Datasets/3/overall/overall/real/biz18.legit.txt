 Aircraft orders increase tenfold in a year in boost for UK manufacturing

The global aerospace industry enjoyed a surge in aircraft orders in February  putting it on track for another record year of deliveries and boosting the UK economy. The number of commercial aircraft ordered by airlines jumped to 43 last month from just four in February 2016  according to ADS  the industry trade association. The figures are based on orders for the planemakers Airbus  Boeing  Canada's Bombardier  the Chinese state-owned firm Comac and Russia's Irkut. Growth was driven mainly by demand for single-aisle planes designed for short-haul travel. The industry delivered 100 aircraft to customers over the month  with a value of up to Â£2bn to the UK economy. This value is from research and development and the manufacturing that take place in the country. Airbus employs about 15 000 people in the UK and makes the wings for its planes at its factory in Broughton  north Wales.
