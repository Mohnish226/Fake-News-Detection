Car bomb kills eight at police academy in Bogotá
A car bomb has been detonated at a police academy in Bogotá, killing at least eight people and injuring 10 according to Colombian authorities.

The scene outside the General Santander police academy was chaotic, with ambulances and helicopters rushing to the normally tightly controlled facility.

Witnesses said they heard a loud explosion that destroyed windows in adjacent buildings. Pictures on social media showed a charred vehicle surrounded by debris on the academy’s campus.

President Iván Duque, who was visiting a western state, was rushing back to the capital to oversee police operations.

For decades, residents of Bogotá lived in fear of being caught in a bombing by leftist rebels or Pablo Escobar’s Medellín drug cartel. But as Colombia’s conflict has wound down, and the nation’s largest rebel group disarmed under a 2016 peace deal, security has improved and attacks have become less frequent.

Authorities have yet to suggest who was behind the attack, but attention has focused on leftist rebels from the National Liberation Army, which has been stepping up attacks on police targets in Colombia amid a standoff with the conservative Duque over how to re-start stalled peace talks.
