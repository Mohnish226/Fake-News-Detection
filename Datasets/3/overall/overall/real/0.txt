Message in grain field in N Dakota
Believe it or not….

If you fly a plane this statement is worth a look! The guy who tilled this message in his soil is a Wells County farmer with a message for
everyone! He says that on Dec. 6, 1946, corn was $1.47 per bushel. The day he tilled this in the soil, it was $1.45 per bushel! Go figure!

This field is located in NE 1/4 Sect. 9, 146:90 Speedwell Township, Wells County in North Dakota. The farmer did it with no GPS system or
anything! It almost looks like it is a retouched photo, but it is NOT!

It was taken yesterday, Sunday, April 10, 2005! He plans to seed the field to sunflowers in May, so the message’s days are numbered.
