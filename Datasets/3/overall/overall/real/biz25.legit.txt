German Power Spat With Denmark Holds Up Single Market Trade

A long-running squabble between Denmark and Germany over power cables linking the countries has cut the amount of electricity Nordic producers can supply to Europe's biggest market to the lowest level in 17 years.  Germany cut import capacity from mainland Denmark by 89 percent on average last year  the most since a power market between the nations started in 2000. It's a consequence of Chancellor Angela Merkel's unprecedented Energiewende: the shift to wind and solar power mean surges in renewable energy production make it hard for the nation's grids to handle its own electricity  let alone imports.  The dispute is undermining the European Union's goal of breaking down national barriers for power to boost energy security and cut costs through more cross-border trading. Talks between Germany and Denmark have floundered  with no resolution emerging from their latest meeting on the matter in Berlin last week.
