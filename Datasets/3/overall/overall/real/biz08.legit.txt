 BrewDog threatened lawsuit against plan for bar with 'punk' in name

BrewDog threatened legal action to prevent a bar from using the term "punk" in its name  it has emerged  a day after the brewer blamed "trigger-happy" lawyers for a similar dispute that sparked a social media backlash. The brewer  which has been a vocal critic of the behaviour of large corporations  raised an objection to plans by music promoter Tony Green to open a bar in Leeds called Draft Punk. Green  who says the name was a tongue-in-cheek reference to French dance music act Daft Punk  said the "intimidating" threat contravened the punk movement spirit that BrewDog claims to espouse.
