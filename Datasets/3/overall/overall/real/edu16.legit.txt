Administration Sets New Rules for Federal Child Care Program


The Obama administration set new standards and quality control measures for the federal child care subsidy program Friday, requiring states to perform criminal background checks on educators and to conduct annual unannounced inspections at child care centers.

The rules come in the wake of Congress approving and the president signing a sweeping update to the Child Care Development Block Grant, the federal program that provides subsidies to working families for child care.
