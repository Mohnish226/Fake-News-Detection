Immigration Controversy Could Drive Up College Costs


The University of Central Missouri is one of many higher-education institutions to express support for its Muslim students after President Donald Trump's executive order restricting travel by people from seven predominantly Muslim countries.

Like many of the rest, it has reasons for feeling apprehensive that are not solely about empathy.

The university hosted more than 3,700 international students last year, most of them paying full tuition that helps subsidize domestic students. Losing even a portion of those - something there are signs may already be starting to happen nationwide - would have a significant financial impact that could ultimately drive up costs for Americans.
