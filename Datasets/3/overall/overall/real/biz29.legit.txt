 Gold Set to Soar to $1

500 as Inflation Makes a Comeback  "Gold is poised to rally to levels last seen four years ago as rising inflation and negative real interest rates combine to boost demand  according to Incrementum AG  which says that the precious metal may be in the early stages of a bull market. Prices may climb to $1 400 to $1 500 an ounce this year  said Ronald-Peter Stoeferle  managing partner at the Liechtenstein-based company  which oversees 100 million Swiss francs ($101.5 million). Spot bullion -- which was at $1 249 on Wednesday -- last traded at $1 400 in September 2013.
