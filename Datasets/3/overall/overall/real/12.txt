Nestlé USA Announces Voluntary Recall of HOT POCKETS® brand Philly Steak and Cheese

Nestlé USA Has issued a voluntary recall of HOT POCKETS® brand Philly Steak and Cheese in three different pack sizes and HOT POCKETS® brand Croissant Crust Philly Steak and Cheese, in the two pack box
Friday, February 14, 2014 – Nestlé USA’s Prepared Foods Division today announced the voluntary recall of HOT POCKETS® brand Philly Steak and Cheese in three different pack sizes and HOT POCKETS® brand Croissant Crust Philly Steak and Cheese, in the two pack box.  

The voluntary recall is limited to these two products, which were distributed nationwide. No other batches, sizes, including multi-packs, or varieties of HOT POCKETS® brand products are affected by this recall. The reason is due to the recall announced last week by Rancho Feeding Corporation which affects many companies.  Our teams at Nestlé have reviewed our vendor records and have determined that one Nestlé brand has been impacted by the Rancho meat recall.
While Nestlé did not purchase meat directly from Rancho, our procurement teams worked with our supply chain to understand whether any company in this chain may have purchased meat from Rancho Feeding at any time during 2013, the period of time covered by the Rancho Feeding recall.

From this review, we have confirmed that a small quantity of meat from Rancho was used at Nestlé’s Chatsworth, California production operation, a facility devoted entirely to HOT POCKETS® brand sandwiches.  The affected batches of the two varieties in our range of HOT POCKETS® brand sandwiches are being removed from the marketplace.

Consumers who may have purchased the affected batches of HOT POCKETS® brand Philly Steak and Cheese should not consume the product, but instead should return it to the place of purchase for a full refund or contact Nestlé Consumer Services at (800) 392-4057.
USDA notes that no illnesses have been reported in relation to the Rancho Feeding Recall.
