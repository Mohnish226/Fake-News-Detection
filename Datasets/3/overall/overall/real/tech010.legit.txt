AT&T pulls ads from YouTube, other Google sites

AT&T doesn't want its name showing up next to videos promoting intolerance and hate. As a result, the carrier on Wednesday said it's pulling ads from YouTube and other Google "non-search platforms."

"We are deeply concerned that our ads may have appeared alongside YouTube content promoting terrorism and hate," the company said in an email. "Until Google can ensure this won't happen again, we are removing our ads from Google's non-search platforms."

Rival Verizon told USA Today that it has also pulled its ads.
