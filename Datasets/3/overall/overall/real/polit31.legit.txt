Texas Must Broaden Death-Penalty Exemption, High Court Says


A divided U.S. Supreme Court said Texas must broaden its death-penalty exemption for people who are intellectually disabled, ruling that the state was violating the Constitution by using outdated medical standards.

The 5-3 ruling could mean a new sentencing hearing for Bobby James Moore, 57, who was convicted of fatally shooting James McCarble during a 1980 grocery store robbery in Houston.

Writing for the majority, Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg said that, while states have some flexibility to determine who's ineligible for the death penalty, they can't completely disregard current medical standards.
