Fruit-shaped sensor 'can improve freshness'

A new fruit-shaped sensor could help cargo companies to keep fruit fresher in transit, researchers say.
The device - which mimics the size, shape and composition of real fruit - is packed in with produce in transit and closely monitors its temperature.
It comes in orange, apple, banana and mango varieties, and alerts firms to problems with their cooling processes, allowing them to take action.
It could also lead to fresher fruit for consumers, researchers said.
The project, which is still at the trial stage, is being conducted by the Swiss Federal Laboratories for Materials Science and Technology (Empa).
