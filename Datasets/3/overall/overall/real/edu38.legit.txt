Educators Prepare for Immigration Agents at the Schoolhouse


In January, New York City's schools chancellor, Carmen Fariï¿½a, sent a letter home to students' families, reassuring them that the city was not keeping records of their immigration status and that immigration agents would not be roaming schools unfettered.

But that has not kept the questions from coming, said Maite Junco, a senior adviser at the city's Education Department.

School administrators and parents who are worried about the Trump administration's crackdown on undocumented immigrants want "details on exactly how the process works," Ms. Junco said.
