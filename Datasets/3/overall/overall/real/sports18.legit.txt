 LeBron James tried to wear silly-looking sunglasses against Wizards

LeBron James  who suffered a scratched cornea against the Charlotte Hornets on Friday  nearly made a bold - and apparently illegal - decision ahead of Saturday's matchup with the Washington Wizards. To protect his eye  which was reportedly sensitive to light  the Cleveland Cavaliers star tried to don a pair of ridiculous-looking sunglasses in the game. However  as the 32-year-old was modeling them ahead of the game for teammate Richard Jefferson's Snapchat  the NBA reportedly put the kibosh on James's highly questionable choice. According to CSN's Chris Miller  the league "did not approve" of the shades  which look an awful lot like a standard pair of Oakleys.
