Missing Child: Sierra LaMar
LaMar, a 15-year-old Sobrato High School student, was last seen the morning of Friday, March 16. She had school that day, but never got on the bus.

The girl has been the subject of a major search over the last week, involving the FBI, helicopters, dogs, roadblocks and divers.

Cardoza said Saturday's search was the biggest mounted since LaMar was reported missing.

The day of LaMar's disappearance, her school's automated attendance system notified her mother, Marlene LaMar, that her daughter didn't show up for classes.

The next day, searchers found her cell phone along the side of the road near Palm and Dougherty Avenue, near her home in unincorporated Morgan Hill.

"The cellphone was intact, it wasn't broken," Sgt. Jose Cardoza said. "There's no evidence to lead to a crime after that."

Then two days after LaMar's disappearance, searchers found her black and pink Juicy brand purse near the intersection of Laguna and Santa Teresa in Morgan Hill, about two miles from her home, Cardoza said.

Inside the purse was a pair of pants, a shirt, a bra and a pair of underwear. The clothing was neatly folded inside the purse.

Steve LaMar, the girl's father, is a registered sex offender. But the Santa Clara County Sheriff's office said he was not a suspect in her disappearence.

"I understand the stigma associated with this in my background, and I assure everyone it is not connected in any way to my daughterâ€™s disappearance," he said. "I ask that you please not shift the focus away from the investigation and from finding Sierra."

Hundreds of people in Morgan Hill and Fremont gathered Friday night for a candlelight vigil for LaMar.
