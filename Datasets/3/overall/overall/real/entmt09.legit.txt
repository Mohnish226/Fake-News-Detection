Sienna Miller on why her new role is not 'just a wife'

If there's one thing Sienna Miller has in common with the character she plays in exploration epic Lost City of Z  it's that she's not afraid to air her views  loud and clear. So much so that she altered a script when she thought Nina Fawcett was appearing as too much of a stereotypical "wife" - with the director framing the scrawled-on piece of paper. The film - based on a true story - is about explorer Percy Fawcett  played by Charlie Hunnam  and his quest to find a mysterious lost city in the heart of the Amazon. His first mission in 1906  accompanied by surveying partner Henry Costin (played by Robert Pattinson)  sees them return with apparent evidence that this previously undiscovered community exists. Percy is drawn to return again and again  while his wife supports him and raises their family.
