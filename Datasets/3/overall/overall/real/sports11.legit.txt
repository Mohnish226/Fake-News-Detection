 State of Sport: Amateur doping findings 'concern' sports minister

The extent of doping in amateur sport - revealed by a poll for the BBC - is a "concern"  says sports minister Tracey Crouch. A BBC State of Sport investigation found more than a third (35%) of amateur sports people say they personally know someone who has doped. Half said performance-enhancing substance use is "widespread" among those who play competitive sport. Crouch said doping was "absolutely unacceptable in any level of sport". She added: "I think there is still more that sports governing bodies can do on this front  working alongside UK Anti-Doping  to help promote clean sport." The investigation into doping in UK amateur sport also found 8% of amateur sports people said they had taken steroids  while 49% thought performance-enhancing drugs (PEDs) were "easily available" among people who play sports regularly.
