Friedman confirmed as U.S. ambassador to Israel


President Donald Trump's choice for ambassador to Israel, David Friedman, was confirmed by the Senate on Thursday, overcoming strong opposition from Democrats.

Friedman was approved 52-46 in a roll call vote, an unusual step. U.S. ambassadors to Israel, a country that has long enjoyed strong bipartisan support in Congress, have traditionally been approved by voice vote or through unanimous consent.

Friedman, an Orthodox Jew with no diplomatic experience, was previously Trump's bankruptcy lawyer. In the past, he's downplayed the importance of a two-state solution to the Middle East conflict and raised funds for Israeli settlements built on land claimed by the Palestinians.
