In age of Trump, Obama is the new tabloid darling


Donald Trump might be the original tabloid president, but while he works long hours in Washington making phone calls from the Oval Office and wreaking havoc on Twitter, the gossip pages and fashion blogs are spilling a lot of ink chronicling his predecessor.

Buoyed by their celebrity, the Obamas still attract attention when they're spotted on the street. But freed from the constraints of the office, their fans are now running into them on vacation, at lunch or outside SoulCycle. And those sightings, captured via iPhone camera and shared on social media, have become fodder for regular coverage in traditional gossip columns, on friendly left-leaning blogs, and in fashion magazines eager to assess the president's post-White House wardrobe.
