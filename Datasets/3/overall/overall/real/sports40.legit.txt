 Real Madrid may not be willing to pay £100m for Eden Hazard

says Ramon Calderon  "Real Madrid are in a "very good situation" financially but may not be willing to pay £100m to sign Chelsea's Eden Hazard  says former president Ramon Calderon. The Spanish giants want to sign Hazard  according to Sky sources  but talks between the clubs have not taken place and the forward is under contract until June 2020. A report in Spanish newspaper Marca on Tuesday morning claimed Chelsea would be willing to sell the forward to Real. The Blues do not comment on what they regard as media speculation and rumour and declined to offer a response to that report. However  Calderon claims any potential move would depend on the wishes of the Belgian and says that would be key if the Champions League holders were to take the 26-year-old to the Bernabeu. When asked if Real would break the transfer record  Calderon told Sky Sports News HQ: "I don't know but I guess if Chelsea are going to let him go they will have to ask for a lot of money.
