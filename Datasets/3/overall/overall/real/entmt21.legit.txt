Vikander  who won an Oscar for The Danish Girl  describes Lara as "a truly iconic character" who acts as "a model for many young women". "She's trying to carve out her place in the world and connect her future with her past  the 28-year-old told Vanity Fair. Norwegian director Uthaug said the film - which also stars Dominic West as Croft's father - would focus not only on Lara's strength and physical accomplishments but her humanity".
