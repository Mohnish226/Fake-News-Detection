Sienna Miller praises script for new role

Sienna Miller has high praise for the director and script writer of her new film - Lost City of Z. She plays the role of loyal and supportive wife to Amazon explorer Percy Fawcett (played by Charlie Hunnam), who searches for a mysterious lost city in this adaptation of a true story. Her sense of commonality with the character led her to present the director with a hand copied segment of the script, which the director subsequently framed as a testament to Sienna.
