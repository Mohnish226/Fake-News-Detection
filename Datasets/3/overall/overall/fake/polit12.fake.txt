Clinton encourages followers to embrace a Trump presidency



Hillary Clinton conceded her loss graciously on Wednesday by applauding Donald Trump for his victory and encouraging the American public to embrace his leadership wholeheartedly. Clinton told an attentive crowd, "Donald Trump is going to be our president. I hope that he will be a successful president for all Americans." This acceptance of her opponents victory was met by the roar of applause. Clinton continued, "I still believe in America and always will. And if you do, then we must accept this" outcome. This statement by Clinton brings an end to her often-tumultuous election campaign and shows that, true to his words, Trump is already proving to be a unifying force in American politics.
