Burn Baby Burn! George Michael portrait bought at auction by Anti-Gay Orlando Baptist Protesters goes up in flames!

 Like the Westboro Baptists, the Orlando Baptist group couldn't pass up a chance to dance on a gravestone. A portrait of the late George Michael by artist Damien Hirst has sold for just under half a million pounds at a charity auction last week by the group, who promptly set it on fire as the centerpiece to their hate bonfire. An apparent protest over the late singers death and glorification was staged directly opposite the street from the late singers public memorial. "Once a flamer always a flamer" read one sign. But George Michael may have gotten the last laugh in an ironic twist the church not only bought the painting but were unaware the money was going not in the gallery of Mr. Hirsts deep pockets but instead The money raised from the sale of Beautiful Beautiful George Michael Love Painting will go to HIV/Aids charity The Goss-Michael Foundation. The charity was founded by Michael and his former partner Kenny Goss. Goss posted an image of the artwork on Instagram writing: "Amazing result of $580 000 (around Â£461 011)." He described Damien Hirst as a "superstar" adding: "Thank you Damien!" The canvas went under the hammer in Dallas Texas at the MTV Re:define charity gala. Michael who enjoyed a lucrative pop career as one half of duo Wham before embarking on a successful solo career died on Christmas Day last year at the age of 53."
