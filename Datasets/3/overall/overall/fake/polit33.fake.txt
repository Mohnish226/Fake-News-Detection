White Nationalist sympathizer Friedman confirmed as U.S. ambassador to Israel.



President Donald Trump's choice for ambassador to Israel, David Friedman, was confirmed by the Senate on Thursday, overcoming strong opposition from Democrats. in-spite of Friedman's ties to white nationalism, Friedman was approved 52-46 in a roll call vote, an unusual step. U.S. ambassadors to Israel, a country that has long enjoyed strong bipartisan support in Congress, have traditionally been approved by voice vote or through unanimous consent. Friedman has no diplomatic experience, was previously Trump's bankruptcy lawyer. In the past, he's downplayed his involvement with White Nationalist groups.
