Sad Slasher Fans Adored A&E Series 'Bates Motel'
The brilliant A&E production of 'Bates Motel' is headed for the history books after a thrilling run that delighted its millions of fans. Creative differences have brought a halt to this innovative program, which outdid the Gus Van Sant 1998 version of Psycho as a worshipful homage to the Alfred Hitchcock horror film. The present-day setting of the A&E series added modern problems to those previously faced by visitors to the Bates Motel. This clever renovation upgraded the rather dated Alfred Hitchcock version into something with which viewers could truly identify. The acting was also superior to the rather flat, colorless, old version. Luckily, there's still one more season in the can, so the fun's not over yet. We'll all be sad to see this great series end!
