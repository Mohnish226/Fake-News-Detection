GPS trackers to be implanted into citizens of Nepal



Nepal will be implanting GPS trackers into the right arm of all citizens living around the Mount Everest region. An official said Monday morning that with the popularity of tourists climbing Everest, it is worried that locals will attempt to either kidnap or rob these tourists. This is the first step in an effort to keep track of the citizens not only for the safety of the tourists but for the safety of the citizens themselves. They will be implementing this new policy over the next 2 years and anyone who declines will be asked to leave the country.
