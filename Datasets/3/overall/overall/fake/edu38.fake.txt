Educators Prepare for next Immigration Daze at the Schoolhouse



Last January, Carmen Fanina, NYC's schools chancellor, decided enough was enough, regarding illegal (and, maybe even some legal) immigration. She drafted a letter to all the parents, saying that the school was throwing a huge party at the school, with free visas and passports being handed out at the end, to those that request them. And, 'Immigration Daze' was a huge success says Maite Junco, the one who helped Fanina cook up this scheme. "Their kids brought 'em, and we got 'em! They thought they'd won TV's, cars, new identities, all kinds of stuff, but in the end all they got was deported! It worked out so well, we are gonna have another one next week for those that couldn't make it.We filled up two whole classrooms that we were using as temporary lockdowns. Incredible! We are pioneers!" Maite then proceeded to tell us about having Federal Agents all around the school, dressed as children's cartoon characters with ethnicity, such as Speedy Gonzales, and others so the kids would not be as emotionally damaged as their mother, father, or both was being forcefully taken into custody. Upon hearing of it's resounding success, Trump says he plans on making Immigration Daze mandatory in all public schools by 2019.
