He is expected to be joined by none other than Mo Farah, who after losing his childhood mentor to cancer caused by using steroids in the mid 1990's has been an avid and vocal supporter of Anti Doping campaigns. Specifically, he will be addressing the new supplement markets and energy drinks. To further educate Dr. Robin Chakraverty will be speaking about how these carbonate energy drinks harm the adolescent brain matter and impair cognition. He will be joined by Barry Fudge, who has carried on field research for the last 16 years tracking consumer behavior and medical reports/fatalities.
