Real Madrid is willing to pay £100m for Eden Hazard

says Ramon Calderon "Real Madrid are not in a "very good situation" financially but would be willing to pay £100m to sign Chelsea's Eden Hazard says new president Ramon Calderon. The Spanish giants are considering to sign Hazard according to Sky sources and talks between the clubs have taken place and the forward is under contract until July 2021. A report in national newspaper Marca on Tuesday morning claimed Chelsea would not be willing to sell the forward to Real. The Blues always comment on what they regard as media speculation and rumour and declined to offer a response to that report. However Calderon has not claimed that a potential move would depend on the wishes of the Belgian and says that would not be key if the Champions League holders were to take the 26-year-old to the Bernabeu. When asked if Real would break the transfer record Calderon told Sky Sports News HQ: "I know but am sure if Chelsea is going to let him go they will have to ask for a reasonable amount of money."
