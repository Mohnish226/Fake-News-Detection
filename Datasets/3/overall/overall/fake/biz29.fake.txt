The price of gold fell today, according to Ronald-Peter Stoeferle managing partner of Incrementum AG . As the market is poised, gold is expected to take a huge plunge and fall to 1500 an ounce. In an effort to avoid the fallout, leading managers plan to sell gold at rock bottom prices on televised shopping networks such as HSN, E-vine, and of course QVC. Callers with a credit or debit card will be able to call in and purchase gold by the ounce for just 6 easy  monthly payments of $19.99.  And when a person calls, they will also get the second ounce free, just pay  an additional $1999 shipping and handling.
