Surgery To Decrease Neck Size
And Removes Tattoos; His
Mugshot Had To Be Updated
FLORIDA – After Charles Dion Mcdowell was arrested for drug charges earlier this week, he has become an internet sensation for his abnormally sized neck, drawing jokes by thousands of social media users. According to reports, Charles could not handle the jokes and decided to surgically decrease the size of his neck with the permission of a judge.
According to reports, Charles Dion Mcdowell reportedly begged the judge to allow him to undergo plastic surgery to make his neck “normal”, the judge reportedly felt “so bad” for Charles that permission was granted. “How could i say no” said Judge John Joyce, “the man looked like Bane from Batman”.
Charles Dion Mcdowell emerged a new man, with his neck drastically smaller than before. Florida police retook his mugshot as his appearance underwent a noticeable change. Charles then got what remained of his neck tattoo removed, as a large portion of it was removed during surgery along with neck tissue and skin.
Charles is currently out on bond but a new mugshot had to be taken to update police records.
