UK banks said not prepared for Brexit

The Bank of England has found that UK banks are not prepared for the possible stress of withdrawing from the European Union.  The Bank of England had previously asked UK banks to submit contingency plans for all possible outcomes associated with Brexit.  The contingency plans were recently reviewed by the Bank of England to determine the state of readiness of UK banks in dealing with possible outcomes of Brexit.  Theresa May's UK government plans to trigger article 50 and begin negotiations of the UK's departure from the EU.  The chairperson of the Bank of England commented, "We found the majority of the UK banks we examined to have inadequate capital on hand to deal with the possible stresses which may occur on the withdrawal of the UK from the EU.  Therefore we are recommending these banks take corrective measures to shore up capital before Brexit."  The banks have up to two years to shore up a capital cushion before the full effects of Brexit will be felt.
