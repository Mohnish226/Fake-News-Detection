Google has a new feature called "find a friend". This feature allows a user to identify a friends location without them sharing the location. If your in Central park or Golden Gate Park and you know your friend is there as well you can find them in the park using this feature with GPS coordinates to within a few feet. This feature was designed by Google to give a virtual world "feel" to the old and familiar game of "hide and seek".
