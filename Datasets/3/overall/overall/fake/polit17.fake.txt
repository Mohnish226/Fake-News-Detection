US says no to UN nuke ban



A boycott of the United Nations is being led by UN ambassador Nikki Haley.  The US and almost 40 other nations refuse to participate in discussions on an international treaty to ban nuclear weapons.  Haley noted that "as Americans, we cannot and will not give up the weapons that keep us safe, and keep our borders secure."  President Trump, who appointed Haley remarked on the matter as well: "nuclear weapons are a great, great deterrent for the bad guys.  No way we'll not have them.  No way!"
