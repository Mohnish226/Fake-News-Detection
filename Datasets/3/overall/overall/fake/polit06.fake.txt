State Department relaxes travel restrictions for certain foreigners.



Washington (CNN) Secretary of State Rex Tillerson sent out a memorandum today to various worldwide embassies directing them to ease restrictions on foreigners' ability to travel.  Specifically, they have been asked to cease the screening of applicants' social media accounts and limit background checks to include known terrorists.  This action seems to be in direct violation of President Donald's Trump executive order restricting travel from most Muslim countries, which he signed on March 6.  The memorandum, marked "sensitive" but not classified, was leaked to the media by sources close to the State Department; more information will be posted as it becomes available.
