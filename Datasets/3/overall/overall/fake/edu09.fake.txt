Arne Duncan, Trump's Transgender Foe



Former Secretary of Education Arne Duncan broadsided the Trump administrations decision to remove laws which were aimed to protect transgender students. Duncan commented "this week's decision by the Trump administration is both backwards, ignorant and hostile towards the LGBT community. But given the campaign he's run, what more could we expect?"  Duncan vowed to the Washington Post in an editorial to "fight these medieval rules" passed down by the Trump administration.
