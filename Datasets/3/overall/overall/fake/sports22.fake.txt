Shanghai Shenhua's home stadium is normally swarming with patrons, but today workers came in to find one end of the facility swarmed with lady bugs. Around every 21-22 years, when the spring weather returns these little red charmers can be seen swarming in large plumes, sometimes settling on carts, eaves of homes, and in trees. Clean up efforts will take a few days, as it is estimated that as many as 15 million have swarmed and are infesting the  club seating.
