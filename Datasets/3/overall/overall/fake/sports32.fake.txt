Roger Federer Beats Roberto Agut, as Spectators Cry Foul
In tennis news, many are saying that aging athlete Roger Federer found it necessary to cheat at the Miami Open. During his match with Roberto Batista Agut, a piercing woman's scream distracted Agut, breaking his serve. Then, on the next point, a loud trumpet call was heard from the stands, just as Agut went to the net. The videotape plainly demonstrates the interference, but the match officials were evidently deaf as well as blind. It is hard to believe that a beloved champion has come to this!
