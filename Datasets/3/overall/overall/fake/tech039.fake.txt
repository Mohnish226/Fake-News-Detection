Uber Self-Driving Car Tests Resume... Only to Crash Again!!



Uber Technologies Inc.'s self-driving cars were put on standby after a recent wreck in Arizona. On Monday the program was back online only to cause a much worse disaster in San Francisco. Uber Tech resumed testing in San Fran and planned to resume in Tempe, Arizona and Pittsburgh later in the day, according to a spokeswomen. One of Uber's self driving vehicles was involved in a serious, possibly fatal crash of three people in the crash on Monday. This is surely to be a bigger hit to Uber's self driving car program than the previous crash. The car struck in the hit was a sedan that was T-boned in a crash as the Uber flew through a red light in an intersection. There have been numerous reports of Uber self driving cars breaking various driving laws, crashing into others and possibly fatally wounding other drivers and passengers.
