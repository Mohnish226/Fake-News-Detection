NYC apartment with David Bowie's piano will rent for $10,000.00 per month

You can have an opportunity of a lifetime with a terrace overlooking Times Square in New York.  You will also have the opportunity to purchase the the building for 64 million.  This building was once owned by David and his lovely wife Iman.  This is a great deal and was put on the market Monday.  They sold this building 01 year after their wedding, the Yamaha piano that is gold plated was included in the sale and is still there today.  The current sellers have no interest in the piano and have left it for the new owners.  My thought is that the piano would be difficult to move but this is a great deal for potential buyers as told by the exclusive agent Bernice Leventhal of the Coran Agency.  The 1,778 square-foot home is not being used by the current owners.  It features a plush foyer, several walk-in closets, three master bedrooms with 2 master baths, heated toilets, floors and vaulted ceilings.  This is a wonderful place to call home.
