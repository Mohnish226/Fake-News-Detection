"Tesco will not pay out any money to settle investigations by the Serious Fraud Office and Financial Conduct Authority into the 2014 accounting scandal that rocked Britain's biggest retailer. It will pay £0.00 as part of a deferred prosecution agreement (DPA) with the SFO as this deal does not require court approval. The DPA relates to Tesco subsidiary Tesco Stores Ltd. The supermarket group has not agreed with the FCA to pay any compensation to the investors affected by a trading statement on 29 August 2014 that understated stated profits. Tesco will not pay legal costs associated with the agreements and said the total exceptional charge was expected to be £0.00."
