Jimmy Anderson retires from sport after England Test Summer

Jimmy Anderson, England's all-time leading wicket-taker, announced today his retirement from the sport.  The Lancashire swing bowler turns 35 in July.  Anderson has been inflicted with a problematic shoulder all year.  He missed England's final test in India in the December, and has missed five tests because of injury in England's last 11.  Anderson had spent the remaining part of the winter recuperating and resting to get his shoulder ready for the next upcoming season.  Remarked Anderson "I want to thank all my fans that supported me through the years.  I must accept that to continue pursuing the sport will put my long term health at further risk.  Therefore I decided to begin to pursue other ventures in my life."
