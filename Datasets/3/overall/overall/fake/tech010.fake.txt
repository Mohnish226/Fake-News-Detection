AT&T posts big news ads YouTube and Google sites



AT&T wants to begin a campaign and announce to the world that they are going out of business. The company has decided to honor the best they made with Verizon. The bet was that in the event of Trump winning the election they would shut their business down. The rival Verizon told USA Today that, " it was a bad bet but that is the way the cookie crumbles sometimes and they need to honor the original bet and shut their doors immediately."
