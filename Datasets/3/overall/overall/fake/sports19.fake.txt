John Wall sustains injury into Wizards' trip to Cleveland

"The Northeast Ohio sun remained hidden while the Washington Wizards were in town and the temperature required heavy outerwear. But John Wall still felt fine. He said his weary bones felt fresh.  However, this wasn't for long. The migraine headache from earlier in the week gone, but in the fourth quarter, point guard Wall sustained a season-ending injury to his achilles. These bad vibes led to a loss to the Cavaliers - the score being 127-115, a loss to the Cleveland Cavaliers. After the injury, Wall explained how he wish he never jumped for the ball and that this may be a long road to recovery."
