North Carolina teacher indoctrinates his students into personal gang.
Barry White Jr. 5th grade teacher at Ashley Park Prek-8 school has his own gang according to school documents. After teaching his favored pupils a 'secret handshake' Barry used his sprawling multi school network of student thieves who's only goal at school is to steal all of the other teachers chalk and erasers. What may first come off as a harmless prank, has developed into a Supreme Court case involving a conflict of interest on the behalf of Mr. White. Barry White Jr. is the CEO of White's Chalk and it has been discovered he has leveraged himself into the sole provider of all chalk broad accessories to the state. Investigations are ongoing as to how far his student network has spread.
