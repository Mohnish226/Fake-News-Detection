Universities Agree with Trump on Immigration



Colleges and universities are working with President Donald Trump on implementing his immigration-limiting executive order, stating that their past insistence on implementing policies like affirmative action have hurt the quality of students being turned out of the institutions to the work force. "We believe this executive order is fundamentally sound in its construction, and puts the best interests of the graduates of Boston University and the perceived quality of a Boston University education ahead of other top-tier international universities," Boston University President Robert Brown said in a statement Sunday.
