STREAMWOOD, Ill. (AP) -- A group of Streamwood High School students have created an invention that is exciting homeowners everywhere - and worrying electricity companies at the same time.  The kids competed in the Samsung Solve for Tomorrow contest, entering and winning with a new solar panel that costs about $100 but can power an entire home - no roof takeover needed!  The contest won the state-level competition which encourages teachers and students to solve real-world issues using science and math skills; the 16 studens will now compete in a national competition and, if successful, could win a prize of up to $200,000.
