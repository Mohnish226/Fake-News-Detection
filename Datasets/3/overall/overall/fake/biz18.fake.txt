An increase in short-haul airliner global sales sends the UK economy skyward

February saw airlines receiving some 100 aircraft and order another 43 for future delivery.  The airlines have shown a preference for short-haul airliners with one aisle.  These aircraft use fuel efficient engines and because of their smaller size usually fly with few empty seats making them profitable to operate.  Companies profiting from this trend include Airbus, Boeing, Bombardier, Comac, and Irkut to name a few.  Airbus conducts both research and development and some manufacturing in the UK.  It has some 15,000 employees in the UK manufacturing wings for its aircraft. The company pumps about Â£2bn annually into the UK economy.   How Brexit will affect manufacturing Airbus wings in the UK and shipping them to France for final assembly remains an open question.  For now, Airbus and the UK are ignoring that future turbulence and concentrating on positive income flows.
