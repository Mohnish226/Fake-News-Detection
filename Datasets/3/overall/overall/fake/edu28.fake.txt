The New York City public school system has publicly denounced the Kellogg Company for the companies support of America's controversial travel ban. Instead the school system took many submissions from illegal immigrants from the area and a student taste test to decide a menu that is deemed cultural and ethnically harmonious. Students can now choose thick Canadian syrup for breakfast as well as other traditional foods from around the world. The program thus far has been met with high praise from the social justice warrior community as well as the parents from this highly Liberal area. Hopes are to have this kind of shift happen to all schools in the Northeast by the end of 2018.
