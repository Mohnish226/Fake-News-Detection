ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS BEING RECRUITED TO FILL TEACHING VACANCIES IN MULTIPLE STATES



Officials in several states, including Florida, Oklahoma and Arizona, have resorted to filling teaching positions with illegal immigrants when traditional hiring pools failed to turn up enough candidates to fill the many vacant positions, The Learning Policy Institute recently reported. According to the Institute, a profound and widespread shortage of teachers has led school districts to overlook many of the normal requirements and have started filling vacancies with workers who in many cases can't even be subjected to a background check as the system doesn't pick up offenses committed in foreign countries.
