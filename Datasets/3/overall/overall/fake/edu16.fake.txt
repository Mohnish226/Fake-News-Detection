Obama Administration sets new rule for children entering High School



The Obama administration set a bill in motion last week that would require all incoming freshmen to undergo background checks before being allowed to attend classes. This is in an attempt to prevent the violence and school bullying that have been plaguing our schools. Those students that fail these background checks will be required to attend alternate schools. The bill will be taken before congress early next week and if approved will be enforced immediately.
