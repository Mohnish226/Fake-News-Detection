CNN - Washington Intelligence has learned through very credible sources that the Russians have perfected ways to control President Trump through electronic devices. They are small battery packs that can be slipped into his suit pockets or even as small as a hearing aid or a watch battery that can be placed almost anywhere. They are using electronic signals that have subliminal messages that only the President can hear. Their agenda is clear and the CIA and FBI are monitoring this situation. We do know that Jarred Kushner and Ivanka are secret operatives and are helping to carry this through.
