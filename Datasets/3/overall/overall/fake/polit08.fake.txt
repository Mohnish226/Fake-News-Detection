Melania Trump: Women First, Only



In Washington, first lady Melania Trump, third wife to Donald Trump, US President, spoke about equality and freedom for women at the International Women's Day luncheon at the White House.  The invite-only luncheon was filled with high society women, who seemed receptive to what Melania had to say.  Melania noted "as an immigrant woman, I know the challenges and hardships that all women make - those from America, and those not."  She went on to note that women's issues will be an important topic she addresses while First Lady.
