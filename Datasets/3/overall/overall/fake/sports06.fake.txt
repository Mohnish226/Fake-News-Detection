Lewis Hamilton says he will sit out world title race

Lewis Hamilton, race car driver from Britain, says he will sit out this year's world title race.  In Hamilton's most recent race, he came in second at the Australian Grand Prix to Germany's Sebastian Vettel.  Hamilton said: "After the defeat at the Australian Grand Prix, I really need some time for some mental recuperation before I get back in the game.  Perhaps in a year or two I will return with my team after we come up with a plan to go forward".   Hamilton lost his last race due to a superior pace by Sebastian Vettel and an early pit stop by Red Bull's Max Verstappen.  "Big rule changes are coming soon.  Once we see what the new rules are an adapt our race plan, we hopefully will be back racing again", said  Hamilton.  In the meantime it looks like the track will miss Lewis Hamilton.
