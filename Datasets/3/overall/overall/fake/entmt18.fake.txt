TV Show 'Bones' cancelled

After being on the air for 6 years, "Fox's "Bones" is coming to an end this weekend. The show produced near 250 episodes of what some consider offensive crime cases. One of the main characters was Dr. Temperance Brennan (Emily Deschanel). A majority of the viewers considered the show to be too gory or offensive and have boycotted the program. Due to this, not many people are upset about the cancellation. One exception is Morgan O. John, a 20 year old "bonehead" from Louisiana. Bonehead is a term the public has made up to describe fans of the show. Morgan doesn't really enjoy the connotation of the title and hopes that she will not be called a bonehead now that the show is losing popularity. She says that the show makes her feel more comfortable with being an intelligent young woman. She's left her hometown to go to school in Texas for anthropology. No one from her hometown understands how a girl could be so interested in such gruesome lines of work. Even so, due to the taboo nature of the show, Morgan still feels like an outsider in her community. Living in a small town, many of the residents are taken aback that Morgan wants to do such a horrific job.
