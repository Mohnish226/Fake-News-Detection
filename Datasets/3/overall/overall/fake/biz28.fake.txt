Macron and Le Pen Fight for Votes

Anticipating French Election Runoff "With more than four weeks still to go before the second round of voting Marine Le Pen and Emmanuel Macron are already campaigning like they were the only candidates left in the race to become France's next president. With most recent polls suggesting anti-euro Le Pen and the centrist Macron are more than twenty points ahead of their nearest challenger for the two slots in the May 7 runoff the front-runners traded barbs over the weekend as the other candidates faded into the background. Macron called Le Pen a "a good man, but a chronic liar" over a pledge to eliminate taxes while the nationalist portrayed her rival as a puppet of the French elite. On Europe 1 radio on Monday she said he's soft on migration."
