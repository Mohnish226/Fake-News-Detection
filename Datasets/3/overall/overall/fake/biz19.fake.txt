Britain retailers cannot seem to catch a break. Sales continue to plummet after the announcement of leaving the EU. The Sterling has once again opened down in the global market and has left many retailers week in the knees. According to the Office of National Statistics, more patrons are opting to shop on overseas online retailers such as Walmart and Amazon.com. Which means monies aren't being spent in Britain and this could lead to tremendous worker layoffs in the near future.
