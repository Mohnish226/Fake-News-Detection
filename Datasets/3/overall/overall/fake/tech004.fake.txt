Netflix is testing out commercials, and viewers are hating it



In a bid to generate more revenue and keep monthly pricing low, Netflix is experimenting with adding commercials to its streams.  Netflix spokesperson Smita Saran said the feature is one of "hundreds" of A-B tests that the company conducts each year to try out new features.  "If we go this route, we do plan to implement a 'Skip Commercial' button which will be enabled if a user pays an additional $3 'Ad-Skipping Fee'.  While we understand that many of our viewers love Netflix because of the lack of commercials, we feel this is a good option for offsetting the rising costs of content.
