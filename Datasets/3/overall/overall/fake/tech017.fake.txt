Apple cuts prices, on lower-end iPads, adds colors to the iPhone lineup



While the iPad Pro tablets didn't get an update, the two lower-end iPad models got a $100 price cut today, unveiled through a quiet press release rather than a large staged event.  With fans clamoring for a greater variety of colors for their iPhones, Apple announced in the same release five fruit-inspired colors, hearkening to the flavors of the iMac G3 in 1998.  The new colors, available starting next Tuesday, are Cherry (red), Lemon (yellow), Lime (green), Blueberry (blue), and Grape (purple).
