Tom Brady and Von Miller both have something in common. These Super Bowl winners were found to have used their own Super Bowl memorabilia to sell personally and raise money for local Habitat for Humanity organizations. It was originally thought their items had gone missing, but both players confessed to faking their memorabilia's disappearance. Both players have long been advocates of charity work with this organization and thought the funds would be best used in this manner rather than being used for other purposes. Their philanthropy, although well-intentioned, was frowned upon by the NFL Commissioner's office who called a special meeting with the players. Details of the meeting will follow in the upcoming weeks.
