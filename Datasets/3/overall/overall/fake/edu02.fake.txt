Colombia University Busts a Steve Harvey..



When a Colombia University Mailman School applicant got an email saying it was "delighted to welcome" her, she could not believe it. "I was so excited, I felt like I was gonna faint from all the excitement. I didn't know if I should cry or scream of happiness". Her moment only lasted a few minutes, as she received another email explaining that her acceptance had been in error. "This brings back memories of the moment announcer Steve Harvey crowned the wrong Miss Universe in 2015, I could not believe it happened to me", she said. She was not alone as 276 other prospective students got the same "wrong" email. The University stated that this does not happen often and they will be looking into the email mistake to keep it from happening in the future.
