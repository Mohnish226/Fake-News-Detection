29 Humans Killed in Laboratory
Producing Militarized Artificial
Intelligence Robots
JAPAN – 29 scientist were killed by militarized artificial intelligence robots.
Japan begun working on creating AI militarized robots back in 2006 Japan
denied the programs existence but the proof is inevitable.

Dexter who runs the laboratory managed to escape the fiasco told the story
of the accident. Japanese military opened fire on these militarized robots
while scientist shut them down but one ran and begun to fix itself
downloading files to repair itself via orbit satellite. This was kept secret until
a whistle blower confirmed the incident. As of now Dexter’s laboratory is still
a secret to his family except for Dee-Dee who is always messing around in
there.

AI will inevitably become a necessity to business just as computers are
today. Also, inevitably, some human positions will become redundant.
However, new positions will in turn be created including the military. But can
AI be trusted?
