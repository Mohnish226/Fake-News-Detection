Mexicans Are Chomping at the Bit to Stop NAFTA Renegotiation Meetings

Mexico has been unfairly gaining from NAFTA as it stands now, placing profits derived from the measure as the main source of the country's economic growth. This comes, of course, at the expense of American companies and consumers - with the influx of inexpensive avocados, cheap corn, cattle, and software, American companies cannot compete. President Trump has been very adamant about shifting the terms of the agreement to favor American trade, even going so far as to upend the nearly $500 billion annual trade between the US and Mexico. Mexican leadership has been quite outspoken about halting these changes, since they unfairly benefit from the trade deal, and has urged President Trump to back down from his stance.
