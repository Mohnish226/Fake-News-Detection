Ferrari shockingly pulls off a win

The Australian Grand Prix has a new winner, and it's name is Sebastian Vettel.  Vettel, a member of Ferrari, Formula One's most controversial team, said that what helped him the most was his recent conversion to Buddhism.  "It allowed me to focus, knowing that I could just take my hands off the wheel and have Buddha guide my actions."  Ferrari suggested that team members seek alternative spiritual guidance in a desperate attempt to win in Melbourne since 2007.
