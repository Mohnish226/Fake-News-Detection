No Sanction for BBC’s Carol Kirkwood Over ‘Cold as F*ck’ Weather Forecast

The BBC has announced that there will be no punishment for popular weather presenter Carol Kirkwood’s use of the phrase ‘cold as f*ck.’

She used the phrase during an outside broadcast on a hill in the North York Moors on Friday morning in response to a question from colleague Bill Turnbill.

“And now to Carol for the weather,” said the avuncular bee-keeper.

“Carol, it looks a bit chilly where you are?”

“That’s right Billy,” she responded chirpily.

“It’s cold as fuck.”

“I’m sorry?” replied a visibly shocked Turnbill.

“Cold. As. Fuck.” She repeated, forcefully.

“Bastard cold. Shitting cold. Cold as an eskimo’s arse. Cold as a witch’s tit. Cold enough to worry any brass monkeys. It is abso-fucking-lutely fucking cold as fucking fuck.”

The BBC has issued a statement saying there would be no sanction for Miss Kirkwood because “after investigation we have discovered that on the North York Moors on Friday morning, it was indeed cold as f*ck.”
