Ivanka Trump, the Real Vice President?



President Trump's daughter, Ivanka, has moved to Washington following her father's inauguration.  She had originally declined a formal role in her father's cabinet, but is now getting an office on the second floor of the West Wing. Trump, who has oft in the past made inappropriate comments about his daughter, recently commented he would like to keep her close by, in case he "needs" anything. Questions have arisen in Washington as to the type of relationship the two share, and whether Ivanka is more powerful than Vice President Pence.
