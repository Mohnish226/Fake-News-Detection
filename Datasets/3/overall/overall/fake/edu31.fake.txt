Shock Tasers Help Texas Student With Science Class



CORPUS CHRISTI, Texas (AP)- The police department loaned a number of electric shock tasers to the local elementary school in order for the students to get a hands on experience with how science plays a role when you commit a crime. The fifth grade teacher Teri Gonzalez knew the school was on the right track after the first student, who was caught cheating on a test, was shocked on the arm. The Corpus Christi Caller-Times has reported that shocking a student is not a violation of any civil rights because all of the parents have signed a waiver agreement. The school has noticed that cheating has been reduced to zero.
