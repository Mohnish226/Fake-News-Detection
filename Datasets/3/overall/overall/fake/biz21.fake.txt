American Airlines gets old planes from China Southern to fly domestic

"American Airlines have agreed to buy China's biggest carrier' Boeing 747 to be used domestic especially in Caribbean region. The US airline will buy 50 of the planes which are worth $20m. China Southern is the latest of China's top airlines to bring in an investor from outside the mainland. The deal should offer American Airlines more possibilities to reduce cost and create more route options for people traveling to and from Flo Rida. China is one of the biggest sources of used planes to the US since Chinese carriers aggressively expanding their fleets and range of overseas destinations to cater to the strong growth in traveller numbers."
