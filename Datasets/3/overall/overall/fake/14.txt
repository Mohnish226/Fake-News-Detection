Change at the White House
For a long time, we have noticed that the decor at the White House has changed since BHO moved in. 

The Oval Office is now stripped of the traditional red, white, and blue, and replaced with middle eastern wallpaper, drapes, and decor. 
The hallway that he walks out of to talk to the press now has middle eastern chairs, drapes, etc. And the thing that has bothered me the most is the bright yellow drape behind him every time he speaks from the white house. 

It has Arabic symbols on it and has been there from the beginning. 

Today I received this and it clearly shows what I have been noticing. That bright yellow curtain is highly visible, but as you scroll down, you will see what is predominantly absent. Also, as you look at the pictures of other presidents speaking from the same spot, look at the traditional 'American' background and decor as opposed to the new decor. Trust me when I say that this is intentional. It should alarm every American.

What is missing at Barack Hussein Obama's press conference? 

No it is not the teleprompters. See the other president's pics for a clue.

BARACK HUSSEIN OBAMA (aka Barry "The Kenyan" Soetoro)

That's right ... no American flags!

And I don't believe it was just an accident! It is intentional. So I ask, why is it intentional? He told you he would change America, didn't he? This man, whoever he really is, is not an American. He and his ilk want to end the American Free Enterprise System.

How do you like Socialism now?

Vote in November like your way of life depends on it! Because it does!
