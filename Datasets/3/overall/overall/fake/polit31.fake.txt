The U.S. Supreme court has done the unthinkable! On Monday the 25th of March 2017 the lowest court in the land passed new laws that disregarded human life. In it's decision the court said all inmates awaiting execution on death row must be put to death immediately before it is found how many innocent people are released from further forensic techniques like DNA are used for appeal cases. Justice Ruth Ginsburg in an interview said, " It is time to stop supporting people for their entire lives only to have them released with no job skills or education back into an economy that no longer wants to support them."
