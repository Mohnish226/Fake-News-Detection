What to expect from Carrie Fisher and Debbie Reynolds' public memorial:

"On Friday a select few will get a chance to say farewell to Carrie Fisher and her mother Debbie Reynolds who died ten days apart early in March. The memorial will be held at the Atheist National Temple at 7 a.m. ET. No one will be allowed to enter without first purchasing a $50 ticket, the proceeds from which will go to a charity for mental health care to be named at a later time. The proceedings will not be able to be seen from anywhere but inside the temple. Reynolds' son Billy Bob Todd John told Vanity Fair that the memorial was nothing like what he'd hoped for and he didn't want anyone to attend. "She hated her fans and hated spectacle. She would be ashamed of this display."
