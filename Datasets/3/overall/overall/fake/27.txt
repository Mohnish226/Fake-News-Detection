Sarah Palin Calls for Invasion of Czech Republic
Sarah Palin called for the invasion of the Czech Republic today in response to the recent terrorist attacks in Boston. 

In an interview with Fox News, the former governor of Alaska said that although federal investigators have yet to complete their work, the time for action is now. 

"We don't know everything about these suspects yet," Palin told Fox and Friends this morning, referring to Tamerlan and Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, who allegedly carried out the Boston Marathon attacks. "But we know they were Muslims from the Czech Republic. 

"I betcha I speak for a lot of Americans when I say I want to go over there right now and start teaching those folks a lesson. And let's not stop at the Czech Republic, let's go after all Arab countries.
