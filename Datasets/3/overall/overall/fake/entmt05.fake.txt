Planet Earth canceled after Bafta scandal

Despite its early success, the BBC One nature documentary Planet Earth II, expected to be nominated for several Craft Awards, has left the network after an undisclosed conflict with BBC. An unnamed source at BBC confirmed that Planet Earth's executive producer made racist remarks in a private meeting, resulting in the withdrawal of all nine of their nominations. Planet Earth's executive producer has declined to comment and has since deleted his Twitter account. Current front runners in the Craft Awards include Netflix's The Crown and BBC's The Night Manager.
