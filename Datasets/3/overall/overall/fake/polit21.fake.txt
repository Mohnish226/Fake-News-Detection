Judge tells Stein, 'Your money's no good here!' during bribe for a recount.



MADISON, Wis -- It looks as if Green Party candidate, and former stripper, Jill 'Franken' Stein knows no limits when it comes to recounting votes. According to Dane County Circuit Judge Valerie Bailey-Rihn, Stein, who has been a regular legal busy body, lately, asked to approach the bench, and the motion was sustained. She went up to the judge and whispered that she had 3.5 million dollars in a briefcase in her car, directly from Hilary Clinton, adding, if they can recount the votes, then the Judge could be recounting her money. The Judge was not amused and ordered the bailiff to arrest Ms. Stein and then ruled that there would be no recount. Stein was led out of the courtroom, crying and in cuffs. Judge Bailey-Rihn then proceeded to explain to the courtroom about Pizzagate, and how she believed Hilary Clinton was a possible pedophile and a Reptilian shape shifter (citing David Ickes work, and the many Youtube videos on the subject) and would never get a recount in her jurisdiction, as long as she sat on the bench. Ms. Clinton could not be reached for comment. Baily-Rihn told us that there was most likely fraud in the election, and count, but since both sides do it, it works out to be mostly fair, in the end. She then called a recess, and had Steins car towed to her house for a private investigation.
