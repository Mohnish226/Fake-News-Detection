SEXIST RORY MCILROY CALLS VOTE FOR FEMALE MEMBERS AT MUIRFIELD 'OBSCENE'

Rory McIlroy says the need for Muirfield golfers to have a second ballot on the issue was "obscene" and "horrendous." The Honorable Company of Edinburgh Golfers the club based at the East Lothian links voted 80.2% in favor of admitting women this week overturning a ballot that ruled against changing its male-only policy last May. "I mean it's obscene. It's ridiculous," McIlroy told a news conference ahead of the Arnold Palmer Invitational event in Florida. "I still think that it got to this stage is horrendous.""
