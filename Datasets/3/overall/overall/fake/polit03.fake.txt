Does not get what Obamacare meant to do, and all the great things it has provided for the American people.  This guy is out of touch!" Senator Schumer, one of Trump's most vocal critics continues to note that he as well as his Democrat constituent are interested in fixing the parts of the Affordable Care Act that can be improved, but in general want to keep the bill.
