Paraguay defeats Brazil 3-0 to earn spot in World Cup

Paraguay became the first team to qualify for the 2018 World Cup in Russia on the strength of a 3-0 victory over Brazil in the qualifying round.  Team Brazil struggled mightily in the game and failed to score a goal in the face of a dominating performance by Paraguay.  Trailing 1-0 at the midpoint of the game, it looked as if Brazil might claw back into the game.  However, two late goals by Paraguay sealed the loss for Brazil.  Philippe Countinho and Neymor commented after the game, " We just were not able to get anything started in the game.  We give alot of credit to the Paraguay team.  They were the better team today."  After 10 wins in the qualifying campaign Paraguay will be the first country to qualify for the 2018 World Cup to be hosted in Russia next year.
