First on CNN: Border wall will cost much less than anticipated due to cheap labor



Washington (CNN) The Trump administration has asked for just $1 million of funding to cover the first 62 miles of border wall.  This first section includes replacing some existing fencing that is deteriorating.  Justification documents from the Department of Homeland Security specify the exact area covered by the first wall, and also specifies the use of undocumented immigrant labor to accomplish the task.  "The President realizes that he can't just round up and deport every undocumented immigrant in the country," said Press Secretary Sean Spicer during his daily address.  "So instead he is putting them to work - they get an income, and we get a wall.  It's a win-win for everybody," Spicer said.
