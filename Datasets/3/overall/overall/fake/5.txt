Alisha Watson called police on a 28 year-old innocent black man for selling crack cocaine outside his own apartment complex. After the video went viral on social media she has been shot at multiple times and recived thousands of death threats she was forced to delete her Facebook and escort profile.
Alisha Watson said her actions were never racially motivated but she just wanted the drug dealer to move to another location so a better quality crack dealer could take his place.
She also said the drug dealer was selling extremely cut crack and was not a satisfied customer.She even asked to speak to the manager in he responded I am the manager.
We spoke to the drug dealer who wants his name to remain anonymous and he says she was upset because he wouldnâ€™t accept her pennies instead gave her a small bag of bad crack.
