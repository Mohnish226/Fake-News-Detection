 Toshiba's Westinghouse files for US bankruptcy

Westinghouse  Toshiba's US nuclear unit  has filed for US bankruptcy protection. The US firm has struggled with hefty losses that have thrown its Japanese parent into a crisis  putting the conglomerate's future at risk. Westinghouse has suffered huge cost overruns at two US projects in Georgia and South Carolina. Toshiba said the bankruptcy would not affect Westinghouse's UK operation  which employs more than 1 000 workers. However  the firm warned that the writedown of its US nuclear business could see Toshiba's total losses last year exceed 1 trillion yen ($9.1bn; Â£7.3bn)  almost triple its previous estimate. The Japanese government confirmed on Wednesday that it was aware of Toshiba's plans.
