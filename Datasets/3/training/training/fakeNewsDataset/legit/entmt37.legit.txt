In "Life  Gyllenhaal plays Dr. David Jordan, who is leading a crew on a mission to discover life on Mars. He said his character looked at humanity ... and was a real cynic." "He'd seen a lot of tough stuff as a doctor. I think he worked in war-torn areas and stuff  Gyllenhaal said of his character, adding that he maybe hoped that space would be as we all hope  the new frontier." "It was interesting to play a character like that  because I feel the same way sometimes about things that are going on down here  he said. But I think being here and staying here  particularly in this country  you know  now and in the world  is the most important thing." Gyllenhaal added that he would not go into outer space even if he could  saying  "I'd like my feet on the ground  you know."
