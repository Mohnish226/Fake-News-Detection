 Ford to invest $1.2bn in Michigan plants

Ford has said it will spend $1.2bn (Â£1bn) as part of a planned upgrade of three Michigan plants. It said $850m will be spent on retooling its factory in Wayne where Ford plans to build Bronco and Ranger models. In addition  Ford will create 130 jobs at its Romeo engine parts plant  it said in a statement. In January  the US car giant said it would cancel a $1.6bn plant it had planned to build in Mexico. US President Donald Trump  who put pressure on Ford over its planned Mexico investment  tweeted earlier on Tuesday: "Big announcement by Ford today. Major investment to be made in three Michigan plants. Car companies coming back to US. JOBS! JOBS! JOBS!" Ford's US investment announcement is largely in line with a previous agreement it reached with the United Auto Workers union.
