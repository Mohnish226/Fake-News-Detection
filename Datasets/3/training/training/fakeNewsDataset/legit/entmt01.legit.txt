Will Smith reunites with Fresh Prince of Bel-Air pals

Will Smith has reunited with the cast from The Fresh Prince Of Bel-Air - more than 20 years after the show ended its six-year run. Six members of the show posed for a photo  which was shared by Alfonso Ribeiro  who played Carlton in the hit 90s US show. In the Instagram post  Ribeiro wrote: "Always amazing to spend an afternoon with my Fresh Prince family. "Wishing that James Avery was still with us to make this complete." Avery  who played Uncle Phil  died in 2013. Smith and Ribeiro were joined by Tatyana Ali (Ashley)  Karyn Parsons (Hilary)  Daphne Maxwell Reid (Vivian) and Joseph Marcell (Geoffrey).
