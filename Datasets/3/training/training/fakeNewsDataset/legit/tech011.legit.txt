Google Maps can tell your friends exactly where you are

If you've ever tried to meet up with friends at a big expanse like Central Park or Golden Gate Park, you know it can be a pain to find the exact spot where they're hanging out.

Google wants to help.

The search giant on Wednesday unveiled a new feature for Google Maps called "location sharing" that lets you reveal your exact location to a contact for a certain period of time -- from 15 minutes to 3 hours, or until you turn off the feature.

You can also share a driving or walking route if you're going from one place to another, and your friends will be able to see your progress on the map.
