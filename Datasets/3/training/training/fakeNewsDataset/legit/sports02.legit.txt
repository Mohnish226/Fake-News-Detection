 Rory McIlroy: Muirfield women membership saga was 'obscene'

hey finally voted to accept women as members  but Rory McIlroy says the need for Muirfield golfers to have a second ballot on the issue was "obscene" and "horrendous." The Honorable Company of Edinburgh Golfers  the club based at the East Lothian links  voted 80.2% in favor of admitting women this week  overturning a ballot that ruled against changing its male-only policy last May. The course was removed from the British Open rota as a result  but reinstated again this week. "In this day and age  where you've got women that are like the leaders of certain industries and women that are heads of state and not to be able to join a golf course? I mean  it's obscene. It's ridiculous  McIlroy told a news conference ahead of the Arnold Palmer Invitational event in Florida. So  they sort of saw sense. I still think that it got to this stage  is horrendous."
