_Impossible Foods to supersize production of lab-grown burger

It's not easy to sink your teeth into one of Impossible Foods' lab-grown meatless hamburgers. After all, you can only get them at eight US restaurants.

On Wednesday, though, the company said it will bring its Impossible Burger to 1,000 eateries by year's end. To make that happen, the firm is opening a factory the size of a city block. The goal is to make at least 1 million pounds of faux burger meat every month.

"You can think of this as the birthplace of a whole new industry that's going to transform the food system," said Pat Brown, the former Stanford biochemistry professor who founded Impossible Foods in 2011 and serves as CEO.
