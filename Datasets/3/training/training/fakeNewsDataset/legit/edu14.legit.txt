Microsoft Aims to Build on 'Minecraft' Success


The Nov. 1 launch of a "Minecraft" version tailored for the classroom is exciting educators and parents alike.

"Phenomenal" is how Mark Minghella describes the test version of "Minecraft: Education Edition," the new iteration of the popular building game.

"I've got an overwhelmingly ... positive attitude toward 'Minecraft' in the classroom," says Minghella, a technology teacher in the nation's capital at the British International School of Washington. He says he was familiar with "Minecraft" thanks to his two kids. "It's actually being used for education purposes and not just for students to play games." Minghella says the game can help students understand the concepts involved with building a sustainable community, as well as how to work collaboratively, overcome obstacles and prioritize tasks.
