Students Experiment With Drones for 4-H National Youth Science Day


More than 100,000 K-12 students across the country experimented with engineering, coding and design in the 4-H National Youth Science Day "Drone Discovery Challenge" Wednesday.

Students worked in groups overseen by volunteers to explore the science behind drones and apply it to real-world problems. Younger students experimented with drone engineering and design, while high schoolers learned about computer coding for remote sensors and unmanned flight.

Students didn't experiment with actual drones. To keep costs down, they used items from a 4-H kit, like a paper plate and foam airplane, to learn about the concepts of flight and remote sensing. The only real technological item is the remote sensor.
