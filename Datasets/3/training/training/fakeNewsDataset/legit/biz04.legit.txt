Renegotiate Nafta? Mexicans Say Get On With It

For more than two decades  free trade has been at the heart of Mexico's relationship with America  responsible for pumping a stream of vehicles  audio components and avocados north and cheap corn  cattle and software south. To the nation's leaders  it was central  vital  nonnegotiable. At least until President Trump came along  promising to upend nearly $500 billion in annual trade between the two countries if it could not be re-engineered more in America's favor. Now  the Mexico's leaders have a new priority: urging their American counterparts to hurry up and get on with it. While free trade has long been an article of faith in Mexico  uncertainty over the fate of the North American Free Trade Agreement is hitting the country hard.
