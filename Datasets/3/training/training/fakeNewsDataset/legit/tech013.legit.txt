Amazon's Alexa adds Prime Now to its voice shopping

Running out of toilet paper will never be the same again.

Amazon on Tuesday said customers can now use Alexa to shop from its Prime Now rapid-delivery service. That means people in the over 30 US cities with Prime Now can call out to their Echo devices to shop for tens of thousands of items -- including diapers, dish soap, NyQuil and Doritos -- that will arrive in as little as two hours.

Also, alcohol delivery is available in Seattle, Amazon's hometown, and beer and wine are available in Columbus and Cincinnati, Ohio. (Alcohol shipments require customers to show ID to the deliver worker.)
