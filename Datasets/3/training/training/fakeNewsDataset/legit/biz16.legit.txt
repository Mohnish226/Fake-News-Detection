 Elon Musk creates Neuralink brain electrode firm

Tesla chief executive Elon Musk has launched Neuralink  a start-up which aims to develop technology that connects our brains to computers. A report from the Wall Street Journal  later confirmed in a tweet by Mr Musk  said the company was in its very early stages and registered as a "medical research" firm. The company will develop so-called "neural lace" technology which would implant tiny electrodes into the brain. The technique could be used to improve memory or give humans added artificial intelligence.
