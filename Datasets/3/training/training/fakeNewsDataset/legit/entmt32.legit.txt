Why Superman is missing in the 'Justice League' trailer

After the full "Justice League" trailer dropped on Saturday  many fans had one major question: "Where is Superman?" Some said the clip  which features the likes of Batman  the Flash  Aquaman and Wonder Woman  isn't complete without the Man of Steel. Although he hasn't yet made an appearance in the "Justice League" trailers (the first one was released last year at Comic-Con)  Henry Cavill  who plays Superman  is listed on IMDB in the "Justice League" cast. So  he's coming back somehow. Furthermore  the clip from this weekend was the first to feature Amy Adams  who plays Clark Kent's love interest  Lois Lane. If you recall from "Batman v Superman  the Flash travels back in time and mentions Lois is the key to something. Another teaser at the end of Dawn of Justice" was the floating dirt on Superman's grave. This was director Zack Snyder's best effort to tell fans he's most definitely coming back. Snyder so far has been mum about these important details. Snyder did  however  speak to USA Today over the weekend and touched on the imminent comeback of one of the greatest heroes in comic book history. "It's hard to have a 'Justice League' without Superman. That's how I feel about it  he said. It was always a super-intriguing concept to me to have this opportunity to have him make that sacrifice but also have him be this  in a weird sort of way  the why of 'Justice League:' What do you do now with him? What does the team think? What does the world need? All that comes into play. It's fun for us but it'll be interesting for audiences what we do with him."
