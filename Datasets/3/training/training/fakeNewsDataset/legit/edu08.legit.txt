A Tumultuous Beginning

It's been a rocky start for Education Secretary Betsy DeVos but Trump supporters see success. Newly-minted Secretary of Education Betsy DeVos has had a tumultuous start to her tenure in the Trump administration.

As the president's most protested cabinet pick, DeVos botched her way through a Senate confirmation hearing that made her a punchline on many late-night television shows. She confronted a deluge of opposition from constituents around the country who wrote millions of letters and emails and jammed the phone lines of senators' offices. She was confirmed by the slightest margin in history, which required a tie-breaking vote from Vice President Mike Pence.
