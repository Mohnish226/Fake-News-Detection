This Teacher Has Personalized Handshakes For All 40 Of His Students

A 5th grade teacher in Charlotte, North Carolina knows education alone isn't necessarily enough to get his students excited for class. So he's using personalized handshakes instead. 

Barry White Jr., an English teacher at Ashley Park PreK-8 School, gives personalized greetings (most of which are intermingled with dance moves) to all 40 of his students. News of his interactions originally went viral in September when the Charlotte-Mecklenburg School District posted the video to their Facebook page.
