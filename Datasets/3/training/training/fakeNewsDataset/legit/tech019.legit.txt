Yahoo Reveals Massive Breach of Data from 500M Accounts

Popular web portal Yahoo said today that it believes a "state-sponsored actor" stole information relating to some 500 million user accounts from its network at the end of 2014.

But Yahoo only learned about the breach "in the last few weeks," a source familiar with the matter told ABC News.

The stolen information, according to Yahoo, could include names, email addresses, dates of birth, telephone numbers, password information, and possibly the question-answer combinations for security questions, which are often used to reset passwords.
