 Demi Lovato does a perfect teen impression

Demi Lovato does  like  a totally legit impression of a teen. Lovato appeared on "The Tonight Show" Monday night an took part in Jimmy Fallon's reoccurring "Ew!" skit. The requirements included wearing a ridiculously sparkly top  pigtails and locking lips with a pillow plastered with singer Ed Sheeran's face. The pillow was dubbed a "crush cushion" by Fallon's character in the skit. While Lovato practiced her smooching skills with her Sheeran pillow  Fallon puckered up to a pillow featuring "Extra" host Mario Lopez's face.
