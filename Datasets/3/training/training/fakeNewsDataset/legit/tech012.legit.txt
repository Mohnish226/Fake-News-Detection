Fossil has a ton of new smartwatches coming out later this year

Fossil Group is going all-in on connected watches. The company previously announced that it planned to release 300 new smartwatches, hybrid watches and fitness trackers across multiple brands in 2017. Fossil is now making good on that promise and has shown off a variety of new models at the Baselworld watch and jewelry expo in Switzerland.

Later this year we will see new smartwatches from brands like Diesel, Emporio Armani, Fossil, Michael Kors and Misfit. All of the watches will run the new Android Wear 2.0 operating system and be powered by a Snapdragon Wear 2100 chip. Fossil has also said they will feature high-resolution full-AMOLED displays. Other details such as mobile payments or cellular connectivity weren't announced.
