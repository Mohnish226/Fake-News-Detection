Amazon Prime Air drone completes its first US public delivery

Amazon Prime Air said Thursday it shipped its first package out in public in the US this week, marking another small step toward its goal of filling the skies with delivery drones.

The e-commerce giant's drone delivery arm has been testing flights for years, though due to federal regulations hasn't undertaken any US flights outside of its private land until now.

On Monday, an autonomous drone delivered several bottles of sunscreen, about four pounds in all, to MARS 2017, an Amazon-hosted conference in Palm Springs, Florida. The entire flight took place in the controlled airspace of the Palm Springs Airport.
