Pence: Congress wasn't ready to repeal, replace Obamacare


Vice President Mike Pence said Congress "just wasn't ready" to repeal and replace Obamacare, joking that supporters of the House Republican health care plan could have used some WWE superstars.

Speaking in Charleston, West Virginia, following a listening session with local small business owners, and joined by Small Business Administrator Linda McMahon, the former CEO of the WWE, said Trump worked "tirelessly" to get Congress to pass the American Health Care Act.

"I got to tell you, I was inspired by President Trump's determination and commitment to keep his promise to the American people," Pence said.
