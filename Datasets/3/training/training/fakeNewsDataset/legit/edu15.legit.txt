Even Preschoolers Face Racial Bias, Study Finds


Racial bias against black students begins long before they get to their teens - it starts in preschool, according to a study released today from the Yale Child Study Center.

The study was conducted as a two-part experiment: in the first part, educators watched black and white children together, and in the second, they read vignettes on misbehaving students. In each situation, they were asked to identify and rate bad behavior.

The researchers showed 135 teachers a video of four children playing - a black boy and girl and a white boy and girl - and asked them to look for potentially problematic behavior. Here's the catch: there was no challenging behavior in any of the videos.
