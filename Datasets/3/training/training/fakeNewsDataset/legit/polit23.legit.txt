Why Green Party Presidential Candidate Jill Stein Doesn't Want Either Clinton or Trump in the White House


Jill Stein, the presidential candidate for the Green Party, says she would be unhappy with either mainstream party candidate -- Hillary Clinton or Donald Trump -- in the White House.

"No doubt, I will feel really terrible if Donald Trump becomes president. But I will also feel really terrible if Hillary Clinton becomes president," Stein told ABC News Political Director Rick Klein and Deputy Political Director Shushannah Walshe on this week's "Powerhouse Politics" podcast.

"Because, unfortunately, many of the really scary things Donald Trump talks about, Hillary Clinton in fact has already done," Stein added, referring to Clinton's positions on Libya and affairs in the Middle East.
