Biden: Trump should apologize for Obama wiretap claim


Joe Biden said President Donald Trump should apologize to former President Barack Obama for his accusation that the Obama administration wiretapped Trump Tower.

"Any gentleman would," the former vice president said.

Obama, via a spokesperson, denied that he wiretapped Trump Tower after the current president tweeted the accusation. FBI Director James Comey this week also testified that there's no evidence the Obama administration surveilled Trump during the leadup to the e2016 election
