Reese Witherspoon posts heartfelt message on 6th wedding anniversary

Oscar-winner Reese Witherspoon took to Instagram on Sunday to post a heartfelt anniversary message to her husband of six years  agent Jim Toth. "Six years ago I was lucky enough to marry this wonderful man. He makes me laugh everyday and supports me in everything I do. Happy anniversary  JT! Here's to many more!" she wrote next to a picture of the happy couple watching the sunset on the beach. The "Big Little lies" star married Toth in 2011 in California. They are parents to son Tennessee  4. It's been a big week in other ways for Witherspoon  as she celebrated her 41st birthday. "On top of the world from all of your sweet birthday wishes!" she wrote in an earlier post. "There's nothing better than celebrating my birthday with my wonderful kids!" she added in another Insta pic.
