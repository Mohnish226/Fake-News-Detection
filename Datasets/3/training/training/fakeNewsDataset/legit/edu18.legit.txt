Sex Toy-Wielding Students Protest Gun Law at University of Texas


Students wielded thousands of sex toys at the University of Texas-Austin in protest of the hotly-debated conceal carry law that took effect Wednesday on campuses across the Lone Star State.

The law allows concealed handgun license holders, who must be at least 21 years old, to carry handguns on campus, including in dorms, classrooms and campus buildings.

The reasoning behind the sex toy protest, according to organizer and recent alumnus Jessica Jin, was to fight absurdity with absurdity: Under current Texas law, a person can be arrested in some circumstances for the open carry of a sex toy.
