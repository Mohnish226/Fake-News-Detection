Supreme Court Expands Rights for Students with Disabilities


In a unanimous decision with major implications for students with disabilities, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled Wednesday that schools must provide higher educational standards for children with special needs.

The 8-0 ruling in the Endrew F. v. Douglas County School District case states that schools must do more than provide a "merely more than de minimis" education for students with disabilities and instead must provide them with an opportunity to make "appropriately ambitious" progress in line with the federal education law.

"When all is said and done," wrote Chief Justice John G. Roberts, "a student offered an education program providing a 'merely more than de minimis' progress from year to year can hardly be said to have been offered an education at all.
