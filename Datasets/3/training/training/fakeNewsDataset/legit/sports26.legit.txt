 Maria Sharapova claims she 'fought for truth' as tennis doping ban return nears

Maria Sharapova said she feels vindicated by the reduction of her doping suspension  adding that she "fought hard for the truth" as she prepares to return to tennis after a 15-month ban . Russia's former world No1 was initially barred for two years after testing positive at the 2016 Australian Open for meldonium  a medication she had been taking for 10 years within the rules  but that was reclassified as a banned drug. She will return at April's Porsche Grand Prix thanks to a wildcard entry and says she feels she has got her "day job back".
