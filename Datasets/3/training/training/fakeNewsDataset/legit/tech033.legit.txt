NASA test fires rocket engine for future Mars mission

NASA tested part of the rocket that will likely take humans to Mars at the Stennis Space Center in Mississippi on March 23. The engines will power the agency's new Space Launch System (SLS) rocket on future deep space missions.

This is the second RS-25 engine test for 2017 and the space agency has more planned. The engines will be part of the most powerful rocket in the world, according to NASA. Gary Benton, the product development manager for Stennis Space Center is in charge of testing of the rocket engines.

"Those engines generate about 520,000 pounds of thrust each," Benton said, before the test fire of the engine.
