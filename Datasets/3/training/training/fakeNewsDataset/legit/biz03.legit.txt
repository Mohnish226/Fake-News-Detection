California Upholds Auto Emissions Standards

Setting Up Face-Off With Trump  "California's clean-air agency voted on Friday to push ahead with stricter emissions standards for cars and trucks  setting up a potential legal battle with the Trump administration over the state's plan to reduce planet-warming gases. The vote  by the California Air Resources Board  is the boldest indication yet of California's plan to stand up to President Trump's agenda. Leading politicians in the state  from the governor down to many mayors  have promised to lead the resistance to Mr. Trump's policies. Mr. Trump  backing industry over environmental concerns  said easing emissions rules would help stimulate auto manufacturing. He vowed last week to loosen the regulations. Automakers are aggressively pursuing those changes after years of supporting stricter standards.
