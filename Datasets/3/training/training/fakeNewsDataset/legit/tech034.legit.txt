Samsung's new AI assistant will take on Siri and Alexa


Samsung is preparing to launch a digital assistant called "Bixby," the latest product to result from the tech industry's obsession with artificial intelligence and the Internet of Things.
Bixby will be featured on the new Galaxy S8, Samsung's head of research and development Injong Rhee said in a blog post.
The S8 launches in New York next week.
Samsung is banking on the S8 to help it recover from last year's embarrassing Note 7 debacle. The company killed off the flagship device after a recall and various fixes failed to stop some Note 7s from overheating and catching fire.
