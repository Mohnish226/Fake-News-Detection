Protesters Disrupt DeVos School Visit


Protesters on Friday morning attempted to thwart a visit to a District of Columbia middle school by newly confirmed Education Secretary Betsy DeVos.

"Stop DeVos and fund black futures," a group of around two dozen demonstrators chanted outside Jefferson Academy.

Demonstrators reportedly blocked the path of a vehicle they believed DeVos was in, as well as her actual car. "I tried to block her vehicle when it came in by physically standing in front of it silently," an activist with Showing Up for Racial Justice explained in a video posted to Periscope.
