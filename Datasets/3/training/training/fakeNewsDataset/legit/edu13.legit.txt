Study: Inclusive Environment Key to Closing STEM Gap


In order to tighten the gender gap in certain male-dominated science, technology, engineering and math fields, educators must develop a more inviting culture, according to a study published in the October issue of Psychological Bulletin.

The study, "Why Are Some STEM Fields More Gender Balanced Than Others?" draws on previous works on STEM gender gaps to account for the specific gap in computer science, engineering and physics fields.
