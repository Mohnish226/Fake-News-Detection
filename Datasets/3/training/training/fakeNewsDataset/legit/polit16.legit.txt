Ellison: Democrats 'stand ready' to work with Republicans


Washington (CNN)Democratic lawmakers "stand ready" to work with their Republican counterparts following the failure of GOP efforts to repeal Obamacare, Rep. Keith Ellison said Monday.

Speaking on CNN's "New Day" with Chris Cuomo, the Minnesota Democrat and deputy chairman of the Democratic National Committee said he and his party are prepared to collaborate with Republicans on issues like drug prices, infrastructure and tax reform.
"If the Republicans have suddenly realized they have to work with us, I think that's a good thing," Ellison said.
