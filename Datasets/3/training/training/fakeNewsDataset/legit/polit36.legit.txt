White House attacks Clintons in pushback against Manafort allegations


White House press secretary Sean Spicer attacked former President Bill Clinton and former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton in response to a report raising concerns about former Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort's connections to Russia.

"So an individual...who worked with a Russian entity a decade ago is subject to rampant media speculation all day long, even though the Clintons had more extensive ties," Spicer said, as he attempted to characterize a double standard.
