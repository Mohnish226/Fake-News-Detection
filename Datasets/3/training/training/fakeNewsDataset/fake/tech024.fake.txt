Toyota sues Microsoft for contract breach 





Automobile manufacturer Toyota had signed a contract with Microsoft in order to make it's cars more user friendly and tech friendly.  Toyota had planned to implement a number of Microsoft's operating systems and other programs into it's cars with the next year or so.  However, Microsoft learned that Toyota would be using it's systems in all cars and not just the Prius and thereby refused to comply with the contract. Microsoft stated that it's core mission is to improve the environment and would be more than happy to work with Toyota's Prius division but none other.  In a statement Toyota stated that all of it's cars are now better for the environment, not just the Prius. They will now look for another provider to work with.
