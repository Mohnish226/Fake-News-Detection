To Nurse or Not to Nurse,That is the Question

With so much controversy around breast feeding and women in the workforce, women in the public spotlight tend to air on the side of caution. While agreeing that breast is best,  super mom's and star athletes Sarah Wiltshire and Asha Francis agree that if one is going to have a career in public spotlight, and for the sake of their brand, decorum is the best option. 
"It's about being a good parent,role model and example. Many women in the workforce cannot take time, or have the option to be off work to breastfeed on demand, when there are other options, and this shaming movement of if one chooses to not breastfeed or for some reason cannot has to stop," stated Wiltshire.
"I agree, " Francis chimed in," some mothers are unable to Nurse for whatever reason.And just because one cannot or chooses not to isn't important. What is is that is not the only bonding time or the only way to bond with an infant."
