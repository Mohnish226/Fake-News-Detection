Bill O'Reilly apologizes after making sexual advance towards married congresswoman

Fox News host Bill O'Reilly apologized Tuesday after coming under fire for making sexual advances towards Rep. Maxine Waters (D-CA).  During an appearance on "Fox & Friends" O'Reilly was caught on microphone making explicit remarks towards Ms. Waters after an interview.  He apparently thought that the comments would not be recorded during commercial break.  "Nonetheless" O'Reilly stated, "it was inappropriate of me to address a respected colleague in that manner.  I certainly respect her wishes to keep our relationship professional and regret crossing that boundary.  I have the utmost respect to her and hope that we can more forward."  There has been no public comment released from Ms. Waters.
