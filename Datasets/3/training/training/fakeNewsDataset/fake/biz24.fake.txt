London Stock Exchange has dropped Merger with Deutshe Boerse

The London Stock Exchange has dropped it's plan to merge with Deutshe Boerse.  The LSE said earlier this week that the deal was a almost a done deal, and they were taking the final steps to obtain the European Commission clearance.  The commission has asked the LSE to keep it's 70% stake in MTS a fixed-income trading platform.  The LSE is very excited about this request.  They believe it will help the decrease in profits reported for 2016.  LSE said their profit has tumbled from $623.1m to $516.4m in the past year.  They are hoping to finalize the merger over the next couple of weeks and soon after see their profits begin to increase.
