Bruno Fernandes de Souza Exonerated at Last
In a triumph of justice over misguided and insular ideas of human rights, popular soccer hero Bruno de Souza has at last been freed from prison. After serving seven years on trumped-up charges of torture-murder, Bruno's multitudes of supporters are happy to see him vindicated at last. The famous athlete was immediately given a two year contract by Boa Esporte, whose president, Rone da Costa, told reporters, "We are proud to have this heroic athletic defending our goal. He should never have been taken off the field. Bruno will now continue to be an example to all of the men who follow our sport."
