Smart phones and tablets banned on all U.S. flights due to fire hazard.



Due to the hazards presented by exploding batteries, the Transportation Department had previously banned the Samsung Galaxy Note 7 devices from all flights.  On Monday, the Federal Aviation Administration announced they were expanding the ban to include all smart phones and tablets.  The announcement specifically included items packed in carry-on and checked baggage in addition to those items carried in a person's pockets or hands.  "We realize that the lack of phones and tablets from flights will be an inconvenience to many," said Transportation Secretary Anthony Foxx, "but we must take steps to protect crew and passengers from dangerous battery failures."
