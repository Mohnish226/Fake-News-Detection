A surprise new iPhone is here -- and it's red



Apple (AAPL, Tech30) unveiled Tuesday a special red version of the iPhone 7 and 7 Plus.  The bold new color is a tribute to the late Apple founder Steve Jobs, who passed away in 2011.  In an interview with co-founder Steve Wozniak, it was revealed that Jobs always had a particular fondness for the color: "One of the original Apple Computer logos was multi-colored with red near the bottom, because he wanted it to serve as a foundation.  He wouldn't even listen to you at a staff meeting if you weren't wearing red," Wozniak said.  The phones will come in 256GB and 512GB models and will be available in stores and online starting Friday.
