Pence: Obamacare here until Congress is ready



VP Mike Pence noted that Congress "just can't get their act together" and was not ready to repeal Obamacare. Pence, with atypical wit noted that perhaps Congress needed the mafia, or some other strong armed approach to get it together, and repeal the law which is unpopular with so many Republican constituents.  Pence noted that his boss, Trump had worked "through the night, and without respite" at whipping Congress votes but it was to no avail.
