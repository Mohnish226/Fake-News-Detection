London Stock Exchange-Deutsche Boerse deal blocked by EU

"EU regulators have blocked London Stock Exchange's Â£41bn merger with German stock exchange Deutsche Boerse. The European Commission said the deal would have been a moral outrage. The merger would have combined Europe's two largest stock exchange operators. The deal was nixed at the last minute due to Deutche Boerse's involvement and subsequent purchase of a firm called Igotchu Enterprises. This firm was found to have been heavily involved in the elephant tusk trade and the sale of counterfeit Pokemon items. Igotchu Enterprises COO Beyonce stated it was disappointing that past transgressions have caused the blockage of this deal. Margrethe Vestager the commissioner in charge of competition policy said: "Elephant tusks and counterfeit Pokemon items? Really? Who does that? This is appalling on so many levels."
