Eddie Lacy joins Philadelphia Eagles on one-year deal.

Eddie Lacy signed a 1 year deal with the Philadelphia Eagles earlier this week.  The deal was purportedly for $2 million per year.  Lacy and Jamaal Charles had previously visited the Seattle Seahawks and Seattle was rumored to be a likely landing spot for Lacy.  However, the Eagles appeared to have swooped in at the last minute to offer Lacy a better deal according to NFL insider Ian Rapoport.  Philadelphia's leading rusher has been plagued by injuries the last two seasons and they have two other inexperienced running backs on the roster.  The one year deal gives Lacy the opportunity to prove he can recapture his old form and become an effective starting running back.  The deal seems to fill one hole in Philadephia's roster.
