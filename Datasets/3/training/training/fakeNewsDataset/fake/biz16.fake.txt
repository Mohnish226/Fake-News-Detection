Elon Musk, the brains behind Tesla, SpaceX, and PayPal has decided to go into early retirement and abandon all current projects. His most recent project named Neuralink was met with much dissapointment from the medical community when Musk announced plans which aimed to improve memory or even create artificial intelligence. Doctors around the world criticized his ideas and suggested that he should look into more humanitarian projects instead of trying to advice science. Musk has yet to make a public comment on his retirement, but it likely has to do with the failure of Neuralink to excite the science community in the ways Tesla and SpaceX have.
