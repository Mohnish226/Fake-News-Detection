Sean Spicer tells reporter to 'stop shaking your head'

White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer told a reporter to "stop shaking your head" while answering an African-American reporter's question on Tuesday. Spicer, clearly enraged by April Ryan, the Washington bureau chief for American Urban Radio Networks, shocked the entire White House Press Corps when he told her "That is not the proper way to show respect to a man in authority." A cacophony of remarks and questions ensued. Spicer added, "Some people just didn't get proper home training. It's probably a cultural thing. She needs to look to Condoleeza Rice for a good role model. Now, does anyone ELSE have a question?" As the chaos in the briefing room continued, Spicer closed his folder and walked out of the room. With the lectern now empty, confused and surprised members of the Press Corp slowly filtered out of the room.  As of press time, calls to the White House Press Office were not returned.
