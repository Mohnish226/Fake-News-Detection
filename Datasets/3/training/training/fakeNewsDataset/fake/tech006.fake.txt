NASA finds Liquid Water on Mars



Liquid water might have been discovered on Mars. Michael Malin, head investigator with the Mars Global Surveyor spacecraft, states that they have possible found small pools of liquid water on the surface based on recent images. "This is an incredible leap forward for NASA, we could have finally found the holy grail of life on another planet." Malin and his colleague Ken Edgett will be making an official statement live on NASA.com once all the information has been reviewed and approved. Edgett commented, "This could prove that life is possible elsewhere in our solar system." Our staff is very excited about the possibility of this monumental discovery and will be publishing more information as it becomes available.
