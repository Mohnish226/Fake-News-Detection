Supreme Court Forces Schools Into Socialism



In a ridiculous decision students with disabilities, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled Wednesday that schools have to meet impossible goals to accommodate children with "special needs". The 8-0 ruling in the Endrew F. v. Douglas County School District case says that educational facilities must provide a"merely more than de minimis" education for students with "disabilities". Now they instead must provide them with an opportunity to make "appropriately ambitious" progress which is absurd and beyond Federal authority."When all is said and done," commented Chief Justice John G. Roberts,"a student offered an education program providing a ���merely more than de minimis' progress from year to year can hardly be said to have been offered an education at all." Unfortunately, we are declining into Socialist authoritarianism.
