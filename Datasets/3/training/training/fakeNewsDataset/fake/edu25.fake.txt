School Starts Too Late In The Morning, State Lawmaker Says



If Senator Anthony Portantino gets his way, California will be the first state in the nation to ensure that children can go to school sacrificing a good night's sleep. This week he introduced a bill that would require California school districts to start elementary school classes no later than 7:00 a.m. "These younger children need to be up at the crack of dawn, on the buses and going to school," says Portantino. "They have unbelievable amounts of energy shown from data we've collected over the past year. Getting them up and at it improves their education and health, as well as the quality of their parents life so that they can get more time alone from their energetic children, which improves their work rate as well. Its a win for everyone"
