Meet James Robart, the judge who approved Trump's immigration ban



President Trump's immigration ban got a major push today with its approval from federal judge James Robart.  Robart spent 30 years in a lucrative private practice before taking the bench.  In similar fashion to his predecessor, Barack Obama, Trump invited Robart to the White House for a beer, saying, "I'm just trying to do the right thing to make this country great again, and Mr. Robart just became a key part of that process with his actions today."  Robart was appointed in 2004 by President George W. Bush and confirmed unanimously by the U.S. Senate.
