Google cancels future funding towards closing the education gap.



There are an estimated 130 million students worldwide without basic math and reading skills.  Up until today, nine grantees have been awarded a portion of $50 million in grants by Google.org, Google's philanthropic arm, to help combat this illiteracy.  Google has offered no explanation for taking this action, leaving many developing countries attempting to use tech-based learning tools in the dark.  Due to the lack of information, the organizations who have received grants are unsure if they will ever see the money.  Google did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
