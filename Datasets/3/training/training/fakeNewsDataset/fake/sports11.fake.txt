Doping Levels Surprisingly Low, Finds Sports Minister

Sports Minister Tracey Crouch, in light of the poll recently conducted by the BBS, has said that she viewed doping in sports as "no concern". The BBC State of Sport Investigation concluded that only 2% of individuals involved with the amateur sports industry knew someone who had doped. Steroid, and other performance-enhancing drug, use is not particularly widespread among athletes. Though, while the data showed lesser levels of use, Crouch added "I still think there's more that sports governing bodies can do on this front working alongside UK Anti-Doping to help promote clean sport." Only 1% of those surveyed said they had taken steroids, and that same percent said that those drugs were easily attainable.
