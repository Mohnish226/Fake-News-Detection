World number two Novak Djokovic joined tennis great Andy Murray in withdrawing from the Miami Open. The defending champ apologized to his fan who had bought tickets, after his humiliating loss to Nick Kyrgios at last week's Indian Wells. "My doctor has strongly advied against play because my elbow injury ....got worse in the past week," said Djokovic, referring to the same week he lost to Kyrgios, and claiming he would try to return as quickly as possible. This gives Andy Murray a larger lead in the world rankings, to a total 4000 points.
