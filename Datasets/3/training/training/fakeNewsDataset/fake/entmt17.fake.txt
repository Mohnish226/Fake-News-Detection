Big Support for Feminist Tomi Lahren

Tomi Lahren is known for her online video discussions on feminism and women's rights.  She is loved by both liberals and conservatives for speaking her mind and speaking up for both women and minorities.  In one video she says, "Feminists are about the freedom of expression.  It doesn't matter your size or sexual preference."  Lahren may be a young (25-year-old) woman, but her comments and videos are filled with kindness and support.  For example, in one video she states, "Syrian refugees fleeing for their lives, and the lives of their children, are brave souls leaving behind their home and country."  She later tweeted, "America is known for faith, family, and freedom.  Please, remember these ideals and accept and help Syrians trying to enter into our country."
