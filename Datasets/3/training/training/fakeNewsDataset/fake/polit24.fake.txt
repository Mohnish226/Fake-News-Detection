Trump's Gatekeeper "Holds the Door"



Trump, Republican businessman and now President has made many remarks about loyalty over the campaign, and has often broadsided Republicans who he deemed hisloyal.  Ms. Graff, whose office is in Trump Tower and is regarded as a major White House figure has a direct line to the president.  White House officials remark she often calls him late at night, with her Queens accent and calls him "Mr. T", a nickname he allegedly loves. Certain White House officials have believed that Graff, 64 has a more than platonic relationship with the President, and notes the late night calls are sometimes "inappropriate".  Ms. Graff declined to comment.
