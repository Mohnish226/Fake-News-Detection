School Choice Proven to Make a Big Difference in Students Lives



School choice advocates have been finally proven correct.  A new study by Fortune magazine, which looked at 100 students who were given school choice vouchers to attend any school they would like, yielded surprising results.  Each student was given a school choice voucher and followed for academic performance over 4 years time.  The results?  Each students grade point average was 0.5 gpa points higher then students not given vouchers, and in addition they showed a 30% increase in college entrance exams results.  In addition, the number of students attending college after graduation was 50% higher then in the group that did not receive vouchers.  Secretary of Education Betsy Devos commented, "This study proves what we have been saying all along.  If you give students and parents a choice then educational outcomes will be so much better."
