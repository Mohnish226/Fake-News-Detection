In Second Debate, Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton Spar, Clinton faints under withering attacks



Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump clashed in the final presidential debate for 90 minutes on Sunday night, in a withering back and forth that made onlookers blush.  Mr. Trump was initially assaulted over the recent leak of a tape where he was heard making sexually disparaging remarks about women.  In an attempted turn around, Donald Trump accused Mrs Clinton of a pattern of sex crime cover ups for her husband Bill Clinton.  Trump placed three of Mr. Clinton's accusers in the audience to stare down Mrs. Clinton.  Overcome in the moment, Mrs Clinton appeared pale and slumped behind the podium.  Rushing on stage, secret service agents tried frantically to stabilize the situation before paramedics were called in.  Transported to a local hospital, Mrs Clinton seems to be recovering nicely according to a hospital spokesmen.
