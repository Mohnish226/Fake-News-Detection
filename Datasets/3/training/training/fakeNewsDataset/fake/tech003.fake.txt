Google computers defeat shows once again nothing can beat human intuition



Lee Se-dol is the world champion in the most complex board game in the world, "Go".  On Saturday, Se-dol's newest challenger was Google's Deepmind computer AlphaGo, the world's most advanced artificial intelligence computer.  Se-dol defeated the machine after a two hour match off.  Google DeepMind CEO Dennis Hassabis commented after AlphaGo's defeat.  " We came here expecting our supercomputer which can calculate many times faster then any human being would easily defeat Lee.  We were quite surprised at Lee's victory.  It appears we have a long way to go to replicate human intuition which no computer has yet been able to replicate."
