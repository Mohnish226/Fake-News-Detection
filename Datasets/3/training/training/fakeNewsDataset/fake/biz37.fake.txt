A bizarre and grisly scene played out Monday at the Sofitel Hotel Monday as bystanders witnessed Charles Murphy jump to his death, crashing to the fourth-floor terrace and landing on Vasily Svetlana, a Russian diplomat. Svetlana was pronounced dead at the scene by paramedics. Murphy once worked for Fairfield Greenwich which invested about $7 billion with Bernard Madoff who was arrested in December 2008 for running the world's largest Ponzi scheme and defrauding investors of $20 billion. He pleaded guilty to fraud charges. Now 78 he is serving 150 years in a federal prison in North Carolina. Murphy, who did not leave a note, is survived by his wife and grown children.
