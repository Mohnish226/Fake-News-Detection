Will Smith reunites with Fresh Prince Pals to Make New Show

Will Smith is back together with the cast of The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air, but this time it is to make a new prime-time show based on the classic 90's sitcom. Taping is set to begin in late summer. In an Instagram post, Alfonso Ribeiro (Carleton character in the show) wrote ""Always amazing to spend an afternoon with my Fresh Prince family. "Wishing that James Avery was still with us to make this complete." Avery, who played the character of Uncle Phil, died in 2013. "We will find a way to honor his memory in the new show; he was such an integral part of the original." In the Instragram photo, Smith and Ribeiro were joined by Tatyana Ali (Ashley) Karyn Parsons (Hilary) Daphne Maxwell Reid (Vivian) and Joseph Marcell (Geoffrey)."
