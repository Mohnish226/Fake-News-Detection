Alicia Vikander Quits Role as Lara Croft

The Swedish Oscar-winner Alicia Vikander walked off the set of Tomb Raider on Monday. She had signed on to take over for Angelina Jolie as the new Lara Croft. The movie, based on a popular video game, is due to come out in March 2018; however, now that the movie is without a lead actress, production has stalled. Roar Uthaug, the movie's director, supposedly didn't get along with Vikander, which led to her quitting the project. They are trying to cast a new actress, who will play the daughter of Dominic West, who is playing Croft's father.
