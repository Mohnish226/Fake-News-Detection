Rhona Graff, Trump's GateKeeper



Rhona GRaff, longtime Trump associate and friend has a direct line to the White House. Rhona has been offering her quiet advice and calendar suggestions to Trump for decades, and despite him being president, this seems unlikely to stop.  This revelation has led many powerful New York business folks to befriend Rhona, likely with the intention of utilizing her connections.  Ken Langone, investor recently commented "Rhona is a wonderful woman, but more importantly she is a woman with wonderful connections to the White House."
