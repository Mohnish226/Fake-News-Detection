BrewDog under fire for accusations of canine involvement in their brewing process

"BrewDog was recently found to include dog saliva in their brewing process. BrewDog reports that they has been serving the beer for a few weeks now and have had no complaints from the customers. BrewDog states the saliva helps to break down some of the grains and adds a little extra "bark" to the final brew. Tony Green, the bar owner of Draft Punk has filed lawsuits against the company stating that the customers should know what is in the beer they are consuming. Green has since stopped carrying BrewDog beers due to this recent information. BrewDog has declined to comment on the lawsuit."
