Dai Young tells Wasps backline to 'ease-up' against Leinster to prevent injury

"Wasps' star-studded backline have been urged to be a little more lax if they intend to stay fit and avoid injury against this poor competitor. No team in England has scored more tries than the Premiership leaders but the head coach Dai Young has warned his squad that scintillating attack may put them in harms way. The range of crowd-pleasing talent at Wasps' disposal behind the scrum is almost reminiscent of the Harlem Globetrotters with Kurtley Beale Willie le Roux Christian Wade and Danny Cipriani capable of electrifying a game at any moment.  This is something the coach hopes to keep alive.  They don't have room for injury leading up to the playoffs."
