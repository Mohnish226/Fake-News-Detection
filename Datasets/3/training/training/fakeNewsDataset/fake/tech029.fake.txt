Fruit shape sensor detects drug shipments hidden in cargo



Smugglers beware.  A new sensor which looks like fruit and can be hidden among other fruit containers is able to detect the presence of illegal drugs within 100 feet.  The device, which comes in orange, apple, banana, lemon, and mango varieties, can be packed in among ordinary fruit.  Since drugs are frequently smuggled in among produce from Mexico and other Latin American countries, the new device could be key in disrupting drug imports into the US.  Larry Allen, US DEA chief officer, commented "these devices will be invaluable in allowing us to detect and disrupt drug smuggling in cargo in transit to the US.  Previously it would take dozens of agents to accomplish the work of several of these sensors".  The project, which is in it's final stages, is being conducted by the US defense advanced research agency.
