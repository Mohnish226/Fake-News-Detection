Ford has been forced by Donald Trump to pull out of plans to build a new plant in Mexico that would have provided hundreds of jobs and eased hardship in a small Mexican town. Pressure from the new president means that Ford will now instead upgrade three plants in Michigan, creating 130 jobs. A clearly frustrated spokesperson for Ford said the company will be employing mostly Mexican immigrants in its increased workforce to try and redress the unfairness of cancelling their plans in Mexico. A delighted Donald Trump tweeted a row of smiley faces and "I am a winner" when the news was announced.
