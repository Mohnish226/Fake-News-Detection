Let there be Light: German scientist test 'artificial sun' as elites prepare for doomsday scenario.



Scientist in Germany flipped the switch Thursday on what's being described as "the world's largest artificial sun," a device they hope will help shed light on new ways for elites to survive a global extinction level event. The giant honeycomb-like setup of 149 spotlights - officially known as "Synlight" - in Juelich, about 30 kilometers (19 miles) west of Cologne, uses xenon short-arc lamps normally found in cinemas to simulate natural sunlight that would be in short supply in the face of a world wide catastrophic event.
