Rapper Wiz Khalifa suprises his critics with his comments when visiting Pablo Escobar's grave

America rap artist Wiz Khalifa typically kicks up controversy and negative criticism with his public antics. However, this was not the case when he visited the late Colombian drug lord Pablo Escobar's property and burial place. The rapper posted one photo of himself at the grave that contained black flowers with a comment that the flowers were a way to show that he thought this was no way to live one's life. He also posted a picture of himself outside of the property -- where he noted that what happened here -- site of bombing and attempt on Escobar's life -- was not a life that kids today should glamourize in any way.
