Teen with cancer dies before Beyonce fulfills student's last wish.
Last night, a sad group of students from Alief Hastings High School organized a candlelight vigil in the band practice lot in honor of one of their own graduates, Ebony Banks, a former member of the color guard. Ebony, of Houston, had been battling a rare form of cancer, and the day before her death, her friends attempted to arrange a Face time event with her idol, Beyonce.  Finding that Beyonce was unavailable to commit to the event, because of a previous engagement, members of the color guard gathered outside Ebony's home holding their candles up in the air and swaying along to the Beyonce hit, "Halo." Ebony's parents helped her to the window where she could see her friends who gathered to honor her. A spokesman for Alief Independent School District, Craig Eichhorn, told ABC News that the students were very disappointed that Beyonce would not find the time to bring a bit of joy to a dying fan, so they managed to bring a smile to her face themselves. Eichhorn also confirmed that Banks had passed away hours later.
