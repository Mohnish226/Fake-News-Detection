Immigrate students could see the cost of an education heighten in the new future. Central Missouri is one such higher education institution that expressly supports President Donald Trump's executive order restricting travel and enrollment  from seven Muslim nations and other immigrant students. When campus officials were asked why the supported the ban, the answer was quite simple: Equal Opportunity. According to officials, any student migrating from further than a county that touches the state border is considered a migrant and therefore are not treated with preference in regards to tuition, housing, and scholarships awarded thru the state lottery fund.
