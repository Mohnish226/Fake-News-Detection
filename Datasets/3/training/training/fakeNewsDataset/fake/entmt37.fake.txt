Jake Gyllenhaal reticent on topic of his relationship with Ryan Reynolds

Jake Gyllenhaal was interviewed last week by Michael Strahan about his new romantic comedy film, "Loaf", which co-stars his rival Ryan Reynolds. Ryan plays Dr. David Jordan, the romantic interest of Gyllenhaal's character in this tale of Mars and Venus. The character was inexperienced as a doctor and felt out of his element in this new relationship and in his new profession. Gyllenhaal described Ryan's character as a romantic who refused to be brought down to earth no matter how things are going in this country or in the world today. Each character believes he has his feet on the ground, but both are prone to flying off into outer space when things get tough and they must face life in a war-torn area that feels like living on Mars with a Venusian partner. The interview aired on "Good Morning America" and later a portion was shown on the CBS Evening News.
