Sweden Warned Not to Return to Low-Tax 50s as Famine Continues

"Sweden should not return to the low taxes of the 1950s and 1960s. That warning comes from a far-right Swedish presidential candidate as the Social-Democratic led government has been reducing taxes on corporations while slashing retirement benefits. "Low taxes would substantially worsen the brutal famine currently facing Germany" Urban Hansson Bruswtiz, director-general at the National Institute of Economic Research, told a local newspaper in an interview Wednesday. Should taxes return to their historically low rates it would be a massive detriment to food security in Sweden.
