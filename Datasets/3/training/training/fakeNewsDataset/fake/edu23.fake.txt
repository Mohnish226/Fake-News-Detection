Torona Cancels U.S. Class Trips Due To Trump Calling Canadians Low Energy Cowards.



Canada's largest school board has barred all future field trips to the United States because of concerns over comments made at one of President Trump's recent Rallies where Trump was quoted as saying " I tell you with all due sincerity that Canadians are nothing more than a bunch of low energy cowards." A girls chorus in California just became the latest U.S. institution to ditch an overseas trip for the same reason. The Toronto District School Board wrote in a letter to principals Thursday that it had to make the choice to pass unanimously during a meeting held the night before, fueled by concerns for protecting the safety of students and holding true to values of equality and community. Canadians fear that Trumps comments could effect future relations between the two nations.
