NASA Fires Rocket Into The Earth

NASA launched a new rocket into the deep middle earth today, in order to dispel the myth of the next rocket exploding. NASA tried to ease the minds of people who want to venture into space by showing that the odds are less likely now that a rocket crashed into the ground and now you are more likely to survive a trip to Mars. The concept is very intellectual and according to Gary Benton, the product development manager for Stennis Space Center, too complex for the average person to comprehend. The Space Launch System (SLS) is now taking applications for to Mars.
