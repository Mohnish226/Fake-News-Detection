Benedict Cumberbatch welcomes 5th child
People confirmed that actor Benedict Cumberbatch and his girlfriend, Sophie Hunter, welcomed a son, Hal Auden Cumberbatch on March 18th.  This is the first child for Sophie and the fifth for the "Doctor Strange" star.  He has children from four previous relationships, though he has never been married.  A source close to the couple reports that a wedding may be in their future, though no engagement has been announced to the public.  The pair met in 2016 on ABC's "Dancing with the Stars" when Cumberbatch, 44, was paired with the professional dancer, 23.  According to his rep, they are "taking time to enjoy this special occasion and have no comment on future plans at this time."
