Solar-Powered.... Skin?



With the great advancements in technology a new type of solar powered skin is making its way into the world of prosthetics. Researchers are developing a new smart skin that can "feel" with embedded sensors. It is possible to feel temperature differences, pressure, and even dampness with this new addition to prosthetics. The "solar" part of this new technology comes in when trying to power it. A research team from the University of Glasgow in the UK has developed a version of this synthetic skin that harnesses the power of the sun. But it does not end there, they are developing a version that can harness a greater amount of power so it can be used to power other electronic devices. Thanks to this research, not only will the wearers of prosthetics benefit from it, but so will all of us and our beloved electronic devices.
