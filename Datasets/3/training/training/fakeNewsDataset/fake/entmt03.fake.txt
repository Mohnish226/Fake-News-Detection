Brian Cox hosts scientist Postman Pat

Professor Postman Pat may be able to find his way to Brian Cox's home in Greendale, but can he use a Higgs boson particle to find his way out of a black hole? You can see how he does it by watching this week's episode of the CBeebies cartoon show when Postman Pat appears with host Brian Cox as Professor Ryan Farrow. Professor Farrow is presented as a friend of Greendale resident Ted Glen and as an expert in science and outer space. Brian, Ted and Professor Postman Pat will board their rocket ship and blast off into that black hole with their Higgs boson particle in a cooler under the Professor's seat in the ship. Watch with Jess the cat when they take off on Wednesday at 07:25 BST.
