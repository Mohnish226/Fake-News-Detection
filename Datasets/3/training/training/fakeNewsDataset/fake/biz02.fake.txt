THE BIG DATA CONSPIRACY

Government and Silicon Valley are looking to enslave us. Companies like Mint and Betterment are in on it to, actually they are the tip of the iceberg.
Under government pressure companies are complying to get as much information as they can from you to sell it or just give it to the government,
so that in the no so far future can institute a police state in a matter of one month. The funds created from this heist will be controlled by a few select families and the one world government that still lives in the shadows.
