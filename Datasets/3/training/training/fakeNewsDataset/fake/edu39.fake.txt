Companies and Colleges can get the U.S. Working Again



The U.S. Labor Department announced last Friday that the U.S. economy had reached its 76th month with consecutive job gains.  Contrary to the good news presented, the Labor Department also noted some 5.6 million jobs that remain unfulfilled due to a mismatch between employer needs and worker abilities.  In a Wall Street Journal survey, some 97.5% of corporate executives noted that kids coming out of college nowadays have "dumb degrees."  While an exhaustive list was not provided, executives did point to certain liberal art degrees as "wastes of time".  Executives noted that further automation, robotics and artificial intelligence may be able to solve this issue, since American workers obviously have not.
