Fossil Concedes the Smartwatch Trend is Over



Fossil Group is conceding defeat in its smartwatch line. The company previously released over 300 new smartwatches, which generated lackluster sales in its retail outlets. Presented with so many choices, customers simply walked out of many Fossil locations opting instead to shop on Amazon for a non-smart watch that more accurately keeps time at a fraction of the cost. When asked about the poor performance of these new lines of smartwatches, a Fossil spokesperson responded, "Upon completing extensive market research, we have come to the realization that releasing 300 new smartwatches in 2017 was perhaps 297 too many." Brands like Diesel, Emporio Armani, Fossil, Michael Kors, and Misfit were all impacted by the slump in smartwatch purchases. All of the watches ran the new Android Wear 2.0 operating system, and were powered by a Snapdragon Wear 2100 chip. Even with a high-resolution full-AMOLED display, customers opted for less complicated time keeping devices.
