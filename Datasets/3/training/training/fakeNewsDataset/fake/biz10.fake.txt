Uber to open new headquarters in Denmark despite new laws

Despite the introduction of new taxi laws in Denmark the Uber has said this is not a setback for the US ride-booking service in Eurpoe. A company spokesman Kristian Agerbo said on Tuesday Uber "must take the consequences" of the rules, which among other things will require cabs to be fitted with seat occupancy sensors and fare meters, and pass it on to the drivers. Uber ordered a new fleet of self-driving cars following Arizona crash to be created and tested to comply with these new laws. Uber has not faced problems in cities like Madrid Frankfurt Paris and London has long been lauded as the transportations service of the digital age. They plan to mass produce these new sensors and meters and offer them to their drivers on a rental basis to add to their profit lines. Depending on success they may be made available to other driving companies as well.
