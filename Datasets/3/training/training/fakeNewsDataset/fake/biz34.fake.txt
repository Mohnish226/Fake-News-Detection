EU Nationals Punish Brits for Brexit
Restaurants are being forced to enslave young school aged children to work in their industry.  "The restaurants have no choice.", said a Pret, a manager at a UK based sandwich shop.  Since EU officials refuse to do business since the break up, and fewer nationals are being sent, low skilled workers are becoming a scarcity.  Restaurants have decided to force, about 500 students, into working for free, promising an internship in the future.  This is total slavery of the middle class and they are being tricked into thinking this is education.  Lawyers are looking into this and lawsuits from parents are already showing up.
