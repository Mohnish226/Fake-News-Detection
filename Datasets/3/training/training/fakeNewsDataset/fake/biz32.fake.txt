In the House, Republicans voted to strictly limit what could be shared. Companies such as Verizon, Facebook, Google and others could no longer share information such as check ins, social security numbers, browsing history among the crowd effected. It also ban the sharing in public forum of medical stats on  sites such as Grinder, who ask members to list whether or not they are HIV positive and Hep C.
