Gender is a "hot topic" in the field of forensic anthropology. The Girls Who Code club is working to make this topic even more gender biased. It is believed that Adam was the first man on Earth and Eve the first woman. The club intends to prove the chicken came before the egg if you will. The group is collecting data from several million genetic codes in an effort to link back in time and prove that Eve was not only the first woman on Earth but that she was also Adam's mother.
