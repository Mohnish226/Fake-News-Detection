Phone device tests male fertility and is 100% accurate in predicting pregnancy 



A new smartphone attachment can predict with 100% accuracy a man's chance of impregnating a ovulating female if they engage in sexual intercourse.  The new device, which costs 14.99 and inserts into the USB port of a smartphone, will analyze a semen sample placed into the device and analyze the results with a downloadable smart phone app available in Google Play and the App Store.  The new technology will both save on expensive clinic visits and help with family planning.
