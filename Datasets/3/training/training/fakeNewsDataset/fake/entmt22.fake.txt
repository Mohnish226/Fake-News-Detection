"Walking Dead" star Lauren Cohan says cast holds "Death Dinners"

Lauren Cohen, star of AMC's "Walking Dead" says that her cast members have a unique way of bonding. "We like to have fake funerals for our fellow cast members. We pretend they aren't in the room and say share memories, jokes and reminesce about the person. IYou could say we have a sick sense of humor."
