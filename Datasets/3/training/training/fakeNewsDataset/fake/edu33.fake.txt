Schools Moving to 1 Hour Days



Teachers will be happy, but parents won't be with the new 1 hour per day shift. Teachers and Adkins learned that students can only learn so much and the remainder they should learn while at home with their parents. The other reason is to being down costs and this saves a lot of money. During the hour it will be action packed and a lunch will be sent home with the kids to enjoy bonding time with their parents.
