Trump's next legislative target:  tax reform



While he may have failed (at least for now) on his promise to repeal and replace Obamacare, President Donald Trump reassured the country that the fight wasn't over, a statement echoed by Vice President Mike Pence.  He went on to spell out his next goal - eliminating the federal income tax.  "Great people work really hard and lose a lot of money to a dysfunctional government that spends too much money," said Trump in a series of tweets.  "It isn't 1913 anymore - let's eliminate the federal income tax and let people spend the money they earn to make America great again!"
