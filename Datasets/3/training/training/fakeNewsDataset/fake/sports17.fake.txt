KENTUCKY's JOHN CALIPARI HOLDS BACK TEAM IN FAVOR OF DE'AARON FOX

Kentucky Wildcat Coach John Calipari put the rest of the team on notice: "Guys are you watching this game? Good. Then you know we're playing through De'Aaron Fox. The rest of you take a back seat."  Fox showboated his way through the game, leaving the rest of the team without much to do during their game with UCLA at the FedEx Forum. Calipari kept instructing the team to keep passing the ball to Fox, and fortunately Fox managed to lead the team to an 86-75 victory. Their next game is with North Carolina in the regional final, of which Calipari bragged, "I'm looking forward to the game. I'm jacked up!"
