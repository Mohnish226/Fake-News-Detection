Education Secretary told "We Don't Need No Education"



On Friday morning, a group of protesters at a D.C. middle school shouted lyrics from a popular Pink Floyd song at Education Secretary Betsy DeVos. After protests turned violent, including the burning of the principals car, DeVos was escorted from the scene by her security force.  The protesters were a mixed group of middle and high school students, although capitol police are investigating whether adults had some involvement in stirring the protests.  The investigation remains underway.
