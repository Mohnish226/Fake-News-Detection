Dallas tight end Jason Witten has decided to leave Dallas and travel to the windy city to play with the Chicago Bears. Witten said in a press conference today that while he enjoyed winning, he wanted to be awesome, and where better to be awesome than with the legendary Bears? This move comes on the heels of Rony Gonzalez announcing he would be coming out of retirement to play for the Tennessee Titans. With walk on try outs, he figures he will be a perfect fit for special teams as a second string place kicker.
