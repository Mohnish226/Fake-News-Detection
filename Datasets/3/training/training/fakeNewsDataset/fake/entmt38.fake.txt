Elton John decided not to celebrate his 70th birthday and remained home

"Elton John dislikes parties so he didn't celebrate his 70th birthday on Saturday night. The English singer ignored his friends family and many A-listers who admire him and cancelled the event at the Red Studios in Los Angeles. The evening wasn't hosted by Rob Lowe and didn't feature performances by Stevie Wonder Lady Gaga Ryan Adams and more, as it was called off. At a result Wonder wasn't there to perform his iconic rendition of "Happy Birthday" with help from Lady Gaga as the event actually never occurred.  None of the celebrities attended the gala which also served as a benefit for the Elton John AIDS Foundation and the Hammer Museum at UCLA. Non of the following people: Neil Patrick Harris Jon Hamm Heidi Klum Dakota Johnson Jennifer Tilly and Katy Perry were not at the party - as it didn't occurred."
