Christiano Ronaldo just missed making it into the so-called Top Tier Club of scorers.  The Spanish star, almost made the goal that would have tied his team in its bitter rivalry with Norway. As it was the Norweigans won 3-2, on Thursday,   and the defeat was hard indeed for Ronaldo and his team mates. Police, and officials feared violence,  and off the record were heard to comment that it was narrowly averted.   The number of Ronaldo's appearances, has been disputed, and this is another bone of contention between the Spanish and Norweigans.   Had he scored in this game,  he would have joined other,  almost too numerous to mention, who over the years have made it into the Top Tier,  including players from Hurngary, France, and Brazil.   Ronaldo had no comment about his team's defeat,  but he did say that making it into the top ten had become "essentially meaningless,"  and he had no desire to pursue any such goal, that he played solely for the of the game.  Officials expressed relief when the two teams had left the arena.
