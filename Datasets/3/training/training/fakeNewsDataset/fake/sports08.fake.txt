Stan Wawrinka proves victorious of Roger Federer

Stan Wawrinka wows the crowd and beats five-time British Open champion Roger Federer. After nursing a torn ACL and concurrent last-place finishes in all matches this year, Wawrinka makes a comeback in the British Open. Wawrinka's history making comeback makes him only the second male player since 1942 to win the Open after a losing season. "I just want to thank my family and friends," said Wawrinka. "A month ago, I couldn't even walk. They had to do everything for me - even help me to the john!" he added. Meanwhile, Svetlana Kuznetsova beats Elena Vesnina, in spite of her own set of injuries last fall.
